"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
