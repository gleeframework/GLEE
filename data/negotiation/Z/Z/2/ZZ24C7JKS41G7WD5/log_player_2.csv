Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable price. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
