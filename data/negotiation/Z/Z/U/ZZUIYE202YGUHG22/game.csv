"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120. It's worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $100 is the best price for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",92.0,Bob,6,
