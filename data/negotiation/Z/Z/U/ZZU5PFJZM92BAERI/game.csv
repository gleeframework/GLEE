"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $650000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $675000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
