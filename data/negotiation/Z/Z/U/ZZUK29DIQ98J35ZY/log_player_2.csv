Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $125. It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $125.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $100 is the best move to maximize savings."
