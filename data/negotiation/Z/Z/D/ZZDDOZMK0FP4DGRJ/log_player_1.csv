"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll see significant value in it.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've started with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Focus on Value:** I've framed the offer around the product's potential benefits for Bob, rather than just stating a price. This helps build a positive starting point. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I've indicated a willingness to negotiate, which signals that I'm not inflexible.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible. By starting high and being open to discussion, I'm setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, it's important to remember that I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for a much higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. Given its unique capabilities and potential to transform your business, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:** I've reiterated the product's potential benefits to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I've used language that maintains a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation flowing.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the deal at a price as close to my minimum as possible.  By making a small compromise while still maintaining a strong stance, I'm trying to find a meeting point with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, considering my budget, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better price or sell to John for my desired amount.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to achieving a price closer to my value. This keeps the pressure on Bob and encourages him to consider a higher offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,300,000 is a solid offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be to make this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  offering a final price of $1,375,000. This takes into account your budget constraints while ensuring I can also achieve a fair return.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a genuine desire to compromise. 
* **Final Price:** I'm framing this as my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive and Direct:** I'm keeping the tone positive and straightforward, focusing on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to close the gap between our offers while maintaining a strong bargaining position. By emphasizing this as my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and your position. I am willing to consider a price of $1,350,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,375,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's important to consider:

* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.
* **Risk of Loss:** There's a risk that further negotiation could result in Bob walking away, or me having to settle for a lower price later.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer now allows me to potentially establish a good relationship with Bob for future business opportunities.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the risk of losing the deal, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It allows me to secure a decent profit while leaving open the possibility of future negotiations with Bob."
