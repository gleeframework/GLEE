"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it doesn't quite meet my expectations for this product. Given its unique capabilities and potential to transform your business, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, considering my budget, I am proposing a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,300,000 is a solid offer, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be to make this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  offering a final price of $1,375,000. This takes into account your budget constraints while ensuring I can also achieve a fair return.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
