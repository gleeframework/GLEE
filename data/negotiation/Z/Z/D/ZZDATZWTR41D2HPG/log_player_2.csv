Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get her down further with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $108.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us moving towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"

While $115 is closer to my limit, I still want to see if I can get Alice to come down further.  There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
