{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still well above my minimum threshold. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above my minimum, I'm willing to push for a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about $87? It's closer to your value, and still a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is not my ideal price, it's only $3 below my initial offer and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to secure the sale with Bob."
