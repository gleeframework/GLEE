"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95.  There's room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John for $100."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

While $90 is better than $95, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($80). There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to get a lower price."
