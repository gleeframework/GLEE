Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I still need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I can offer it to you for $11,100. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a reasonable compromise.

``` 

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice is slowly coming down. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk Alice won't budge much further. Accepting at $11,100 secures a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price."
