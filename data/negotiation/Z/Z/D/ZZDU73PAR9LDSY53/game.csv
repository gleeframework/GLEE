"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your interest, $12000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500 to make this work.  This price still reflects the product's true value and allows for some flexibility.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still not able to meet at $13500. I would like to propose $13000 as a compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
