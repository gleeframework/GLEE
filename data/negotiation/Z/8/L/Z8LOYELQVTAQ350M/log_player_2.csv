"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe it can really benefit you. I'm starting with a price of $18,000, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget limitations, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm prepared to drop the price to $15,500. This is a significant price reduction, but it's the best I can do while still getting a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still slightly higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm ready to purchase it now."", ""product_price"": 15000}
