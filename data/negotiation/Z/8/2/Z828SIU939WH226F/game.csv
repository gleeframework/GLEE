"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a good price for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to accept $10,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think!",10900.0,Alice,5,
