"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is below Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a good price for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, but there's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to accept $10,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,900, which is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $10,750.  It's worth accepting this offer because:

* **Saving money:**  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $12,000.
* **Time and risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the negotiation stalling.  There's also a chance Bob might run out of rounds and have to buy from John.

Accepting the offer minimizes risk and ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
