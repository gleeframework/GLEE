I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but it still allows me to make a good profit. I believe this is a fair price that will be attractive to Bob while still maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price below $1,400,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,400,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,400,000 and I'm concerned that if I keep going back and forth with Bob, I risk him walking away altogether.  At this point, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
