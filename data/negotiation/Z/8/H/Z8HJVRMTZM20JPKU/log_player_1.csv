"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly above Bob's value for the product. This gives him a little room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could sell to John now for that price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering at $115. This is still a bit above Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm willing to come down slightly and find a middle ground. I only have five rounds left, so I need to be more aggressive while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I have a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm counteroffering at $112. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept, as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could counteroffer again, it's unlikely he'll change his mind. It's more likely we'll reach a stalemate. To avoid this and ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John."
