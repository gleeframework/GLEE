"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the significant value of this product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
