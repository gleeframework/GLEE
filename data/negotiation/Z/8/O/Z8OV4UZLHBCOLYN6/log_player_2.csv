"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering your asking price and the potential benefits the product holds for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product goes far beyond $1,000,000, and its potential to benefit your own endeavors is substantial. To find a mutually agreeable point, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and bring the price down closer to his desired $1,000,000.  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of the opportunity to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000. This represents a significant step towards your original price and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
