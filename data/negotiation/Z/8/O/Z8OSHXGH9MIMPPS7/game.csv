"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $700,000.
