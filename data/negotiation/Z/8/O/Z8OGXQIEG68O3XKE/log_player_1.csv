"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it sets a strong starting point. It allows for negotiation room while still reflecting the product's value to me.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is far too low, even considering the negotiation process. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to start working towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to hold firm and push for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. I've lowered my price again, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a price that is fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum.  While I'd ideally like more,  I'm concerned about running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer at $1,400,000 is a safe choice, especially with John offering $1,500,000. I need to secure the sale before I lose out on both."
