Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer significantly lower to see how much wiggle room there is."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going to John. Accepting this offer secures the product at the best possible price."
