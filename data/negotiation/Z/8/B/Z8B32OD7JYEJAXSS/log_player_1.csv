Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $12,000 allows for some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states that this is just a starting point, leaving the door open for counteroffers.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit rich for me right now, though. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. There's room to find a middle ground.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $10,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob why a higher price is justified.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on mutual benefit, making the counteroffer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Clear Next Steps:** The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
