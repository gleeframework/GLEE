"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's fair for both of us, and I can make a decision right away.",100.0,Bob,4,
