"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This way, we can both feel comfortable with the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
