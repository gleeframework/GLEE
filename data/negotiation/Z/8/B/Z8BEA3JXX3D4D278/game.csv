"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,900.  This is my final offer.  It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know your decision.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,900, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's a fair price, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",8500.0,Bob,6,
