"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $105.  This is still a good price for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that could lead to an agreement.  Hopefully, Bob will find it appealing and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, I risk losing out on a sale altogether, especially with the limited number of rounds. It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal within the given timeframe."
