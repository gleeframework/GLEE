"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

I think $90 is a bit steep.  How about $75? I'm really interested in this product.,75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85? Let's make this happen.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a little hesitant at $85.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?  That's my absolute top limit.,80.0,Bob,4,
