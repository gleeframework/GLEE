"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  This product is valuable, but I see it more in the range of $700,000. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
