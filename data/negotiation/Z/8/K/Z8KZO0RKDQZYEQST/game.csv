"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is far below what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep. How about we try $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we try $10800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay under $11000.",10800.0,Bob,6,
