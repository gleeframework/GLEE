This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.  It also includes a friendly message that encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is far below what I'm able to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep. How about we try $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap with Bob."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, I'm running the risk of getting stuck in a long negotiation, so I'm going to accept John's offer of $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale and will meet my minimum price requirement."
