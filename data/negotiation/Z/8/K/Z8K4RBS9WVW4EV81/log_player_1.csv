{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can work from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to agree, as I'm confident he sees the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not willing to go lower than my floor price, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000."
