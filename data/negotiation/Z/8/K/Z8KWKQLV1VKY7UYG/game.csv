"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",130.0,Alice,5,
