I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $60 is better than $50, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

I'm lowering the price again to $80.  It's a risk, but I'm trying to reach a compromise with Bob before we run out of rounds and I'm forced to sell to John for $150."
