Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and potentially work towards a mutually agreeable price.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to negotiate further to secure a better deal. While John's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 if I can avoid it. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $825,000, which is the midpoint between my original offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm also reiterating the product's value to emphasize that my offer is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's my final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. Given John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
