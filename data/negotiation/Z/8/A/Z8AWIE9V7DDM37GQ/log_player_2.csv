(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $1,200,000 is above your budget, and there's always the option to buy from John for $1,000,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price, and with limited rounds remaining, it's wiser to secure the product from John. You've demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Alice hasn't been willing to meet your price.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed deal with John."
