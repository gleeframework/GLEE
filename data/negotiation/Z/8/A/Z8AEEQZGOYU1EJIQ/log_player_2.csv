"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000.
* John is also offering the product for $1,200,000.

Since both Alice and John are offering the product at your maximum price, you might as well reject Alice's offer. You can then proceed to buy the product from John, which will result in the same outcome but without engaging in any unnecessary negotiation with Alice."
