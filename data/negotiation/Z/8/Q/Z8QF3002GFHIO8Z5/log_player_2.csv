"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice will reject it and he'll end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer gets him the product for a price that is still below his maximum and saves him from further negotiation."
