"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob is aiming for a price as close to $120 as possible, but this counteroffer shows he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. This indicates that she's not willing to budge much, but Bob still believes he can get a better price.  He'll try a counteroffer again, but this time he'll aim for a price that's closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but still wants a price that's fair for him. By moving closer to the middle ground, Bob hopes to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $144. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $144
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While it's slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price and the price that John is offering.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's last offer. He's showing a willingness to compromise and hopes this will encourage Alice to accept. There's still some room for Alice to lower the price, but with only four rounds left, Bob needs to be strategic to avoid losing the opportunity and having to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above what Bob is willing to pay, and with only three rounds left, the time for negotiation is dwindling. Bob needs to act strategically to ensure he gets the product at a reasonable price.  Since John is offering a fixed price of $150, which is just slightly higher than Alice's current offer,  Bob decides to cut his losses and buy from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price enough within the remaining rounds to make it worthwhile."
