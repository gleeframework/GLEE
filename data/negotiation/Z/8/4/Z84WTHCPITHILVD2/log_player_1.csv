{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **It demonstrates confidence:**  Starting high shows you believe in the value of your product. 

However, be prepared to adjust your price depending on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you'll need to consider lowering the price or potentially ending the negotiation and selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to offer $13,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer, so let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's close to your desired price of $14,000, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for you."
