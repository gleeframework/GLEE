Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to leverage his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
