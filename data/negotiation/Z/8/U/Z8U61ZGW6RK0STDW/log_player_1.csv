Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This price is above my minimum value of $100, but it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum value of $100, and it's closer to my initial asking price. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $100 if I need to."
