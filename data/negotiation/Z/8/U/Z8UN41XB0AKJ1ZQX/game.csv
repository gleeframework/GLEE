"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above this price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,250,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?  This reflects its true worth while still offering you a great deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we try $1,275,000? This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,275,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
