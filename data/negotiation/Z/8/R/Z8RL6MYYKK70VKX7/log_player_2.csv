"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to get a great deal while ensuring I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice seems keen to sell and you can always fall back on John's offer."
