``` 

This offer is above Bob's estimated value, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than your minimum asking price, leaving room for you to make concessions if needed. This approach aims to maximize your potential profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to  $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and significantly below the value I place on the product. While I want to maximize my profits, I'm willing to negotiate, but $600,000 is simply unacceptable. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum acceptable value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room for further compromise before I'm satisfied."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $750,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $850,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to move closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
