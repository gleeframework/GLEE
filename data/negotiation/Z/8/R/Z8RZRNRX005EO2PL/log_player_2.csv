"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $180 is well above his maximum budget of $120. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $120 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $150 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $150 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to do $135? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both some wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 135}
