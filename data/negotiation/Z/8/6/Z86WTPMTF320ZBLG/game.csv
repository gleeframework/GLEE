"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800000 to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $875000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about $840000? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us.",840000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $840000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession -  $860000. It's a fair compromise that respects our both our needs.  Let's seal this deal.",860000.0,Alice,5,
