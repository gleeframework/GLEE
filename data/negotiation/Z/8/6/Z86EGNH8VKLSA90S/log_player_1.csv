{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering $115, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  This gives me a chance to earn more than selling to John, while also being a fair price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $115.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $112.50?  That way we both get a little closer to our preferred price."", ""product_price"": 112.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $111? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a little more, this is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price and closer to my desired price than selling to John."
