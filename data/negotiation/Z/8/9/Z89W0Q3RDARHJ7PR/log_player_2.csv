"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's no point in buying from John yet, as I have 10 rounds to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 50% discount from Alice's initial price. This aggressive approach could incentivize Alice to negotiate seriously, as she's already aware of my $1,000,000 budget.  I want to see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above my budget. I need to keep negotiating to get closer to my desired price. Buying from John now would mean I'm paying more than I need to, and I still have several rounds left to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to my budget. This time, I'm aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's latest offer. Hopefully, this compromise will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price,  it's still over my budget. I still have several rounds left to negotiate and I'm confident I can push for a better deal. Buying from John now would mean paying more than I need to.  I'll continue to counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still holding firm on my budget.  This counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will entice Alice to accept, as it's only $50,000 above my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $50,000 over my budget. While I'm getting closer to my target price, I'm not willing to pay that much yet.  I'm optimistic about securing a deal closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation. Buying from John now means I'm paying more than I need to.  I will continue to counteroffer, aiming to close the deal within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. It's exactly my budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the negotiation so far. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John as I have no more room to compromise.  The pressure is now on Alice to accept, as this is my final counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I have to go with option (3) and buy from John. Alice is still $25,000 over my budget, and with only one round left, I have no leverage to negotiate further.  I've pushed hard, but I've reached my limit. It's better to secure the product now from John than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
