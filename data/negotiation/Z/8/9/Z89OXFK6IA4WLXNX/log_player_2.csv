"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's initial offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Therefore, it's logical to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** Bob is aiming to get the price below his $120 limit. A counteroffer of $115 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $115 is not Bob's absolute bottom line. This gives Alice some room to counter without losing the deal.
* **Setting the tone:**  The message conveys that Bob is interested but firm on getting a good price, without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $122? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** Alice's offer of $122 is still above Bob's $120 maximum. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** Bob has already successfully negotiated Alice's price down from $130.  There is potential to get it even lower. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains his position and doesn't give in to Alice's pressure.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $122 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $118. This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer shows Bob's commitment to closing the deal while staying within his budget.  ""Final offer"" wording adds pressure and urgency.
* **Small concession:** $118 is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Focused on the deal:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal, making Alice more likely to consider accepting."
