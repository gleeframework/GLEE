"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, considering it's worth $8,000 to you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is just too low for me. Considering the product is worth $12,000 to you, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. I'm trying to save as much as I can, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Bob,4,
