Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Justify the Price:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""value and potential"") to make the higher price more palatable.

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a chance to renegotiate before going to John."
