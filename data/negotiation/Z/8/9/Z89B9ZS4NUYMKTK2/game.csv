"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on a price.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'd need at least $13,750 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $13,750. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
