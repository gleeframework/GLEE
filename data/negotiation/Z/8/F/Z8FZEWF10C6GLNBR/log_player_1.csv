{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I'd like to get more, Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I continue negotiating, he might walk away.  Selling to John guarantees me at least $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing that amount."
