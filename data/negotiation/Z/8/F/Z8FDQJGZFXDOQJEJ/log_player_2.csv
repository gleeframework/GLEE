# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm starting negotiations at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason: While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round, or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise and is the highest I can afford."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value the product highly, I want to find a solution that works for us both. Would you consider $1,250,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's budget, but close enough that it's worth another round of negotiation. Bob has a strong case to make for a lower price, as he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute limit. This price allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
