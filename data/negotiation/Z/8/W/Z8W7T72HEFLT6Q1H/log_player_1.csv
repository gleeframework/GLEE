Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, while still leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. It shows that I am willing to negotiate but also signals that I won't settle for an unreasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging from his initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,500,000.  It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price than continue this unproductive negotiation."
