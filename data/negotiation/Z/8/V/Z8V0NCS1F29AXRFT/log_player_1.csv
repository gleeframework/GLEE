Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $120 for it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings you."", ""product_price"": 110}
