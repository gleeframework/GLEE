"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, my budget for this product is $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $11000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11750. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further. He's only $250 away from his target price, so it's worth trying to see if Alice will budge a little more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also needs to decide if the time and effort of further negotiation is worth the potential savings. 

* **Alice's offer is only $500 above Bob's target price.**  This is a relatively small difference.
* **The negotiation has already gone back and forth a few times.** Continuing to bargain might not yield much more savings.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed price, but it's more expensive.** 

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings might not be significant enough to justify the additional time and effort.  He's already secured a good price and can move forward with the purchase."
