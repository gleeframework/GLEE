"Bob, I have a product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price of $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its true worth.  Consider it carefully, as I'm confident another buyer will be happy to purchase it for full price if you decline.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
