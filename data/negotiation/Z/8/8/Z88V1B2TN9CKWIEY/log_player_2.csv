# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by you, and we're eager to share its benefits with you. Let's work together to find a fair price that works for both of us. Would you like to start with an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

 Alice's starting offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still too high compared to John's offer. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose a price of $82 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between our interests. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price range, and $82 is a reasonable deal. It's better to secure the product now rather than risk the price going up or running out of time."
