"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,400,000 is less than what John is asking, there's still room to negotiate with Alice. Bob can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering $1,200,000, which is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and might tempt Alice to consider it, especially since she values the product at $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and allows Bob to secure the product within his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is too great."
