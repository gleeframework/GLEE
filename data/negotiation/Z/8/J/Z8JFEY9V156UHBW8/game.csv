"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we work something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000.  This price still leaves a significant profit margin for you and allows me to secure a good return. Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
