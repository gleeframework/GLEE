"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,
