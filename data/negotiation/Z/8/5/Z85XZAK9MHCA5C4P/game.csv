"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not going to give up much more. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,650. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10650.0,Alice,9,
