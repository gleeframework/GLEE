"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price offered by John. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price. Even if the negotiations fail, you can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's likely that Alice will counter back with a higher price, but hopefully, we can arrive at a mutually agreeable price that's still below $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to drive the price down further.  There's still room for improvement, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept."
