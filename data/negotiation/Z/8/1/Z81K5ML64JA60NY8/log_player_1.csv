{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I want to give you a preferential rate before exploring other options."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it above that price is necessary.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying significantly above his valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, creating a sense of urgency."
