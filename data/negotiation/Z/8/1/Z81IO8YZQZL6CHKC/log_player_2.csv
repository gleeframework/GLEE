"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, you can still potentially save more by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $115. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than my maximum price.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go lower, but I want to see if she's willing to compromise first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is only slightly lower than my maximum price of $120. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get her down to my ideal price.  Since John is willing to sell for my maximum price, it's more efficient to simply buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
