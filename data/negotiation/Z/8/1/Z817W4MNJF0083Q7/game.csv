"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the product's value and rarity. However, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is still a fair price given the product's unique nature and my desire to acquire it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1250000. This is a fair price given the product's uniqueness and my desire to acquire it. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
