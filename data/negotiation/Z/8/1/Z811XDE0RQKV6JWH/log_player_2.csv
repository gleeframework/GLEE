"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. I'm asking for $12,000, which is still a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000), you're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

It's always a good strategy to minimize your expenses, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that goal."
