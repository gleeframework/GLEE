Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Above Minimum:**  The price is comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

**Important Note:**  There's a balance between a high opening offer and scaring Bob away. This offer aims to strike that balance."
