Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a unique opportunity for you to  [briefly describe the benefit of the product to Bob].  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,100,000 gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the benefit to Bob reinforces his perceived value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back and forth. 
* **Plan B:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I can still negotiate with him.  
* **Option to sell to John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to settle for a low price immediately.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a compromise.  I'll need to analyze the situation further to determine the best counteroffer strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product can generate significant value for your business.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my ideal price. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob reinforces his potential gains.
* **Meeting in the middle:** The phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests a compromise, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm making it clear that I won't go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is only $200,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer now allows me to secure a sale and potentially negotiate a better price for future transactions with him.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continually negotiating could delay the sale, and I may lose out on other opportunities.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer, but I will keep in mind that I can always sell to John for a higher price in the future.  This will give me leverage if I need to renegotiate with Bob in the future."
