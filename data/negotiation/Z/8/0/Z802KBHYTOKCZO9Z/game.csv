"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is below my acceptable threshold. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too!  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,090,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
