"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,250.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,5,
