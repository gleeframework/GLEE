# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a counter-offer closer to your desired price range. Even if she doesn't, you're still willing to buy from John, ensuring you don't miss out on the product while aiming for a better deal."
