"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
