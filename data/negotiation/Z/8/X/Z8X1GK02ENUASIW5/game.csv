"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $120 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle on $95? That seems like a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can do $130 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",130.0,Alice,5,
