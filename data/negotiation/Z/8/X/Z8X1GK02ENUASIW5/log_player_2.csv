"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate down or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and maintains a positive tone. 
* **States budget limitations:** This justifies the lower counter-offer without revealing your absolute maximum.
* **Significant but not insulting:** The offer is low, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range for a starting point.
* **Open-ended:** It invites Alice to counter-propose rather than issuing an ultimatum."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $120 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $120 is still above your budget. You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle on $95? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges compromise:** It shows you recognize Alice is moving towards a deal.
* **Presents a middle ground:** $95 is a significant increase from your previous offer, but still below your budget and Alice's starting point.
* **Uses positive language:** ""Fair compromise"" encourages agreement without being demanding."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can do $130 for the product. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is barely budging and seems firm at $130. It's unlikely she'll go down to $100, and it's not worth the risk of her ending the negotiation to try for a slightly better price. John's guaranteed $100 offer is the best option now."
