"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're looking to spend no more than $1,000,000. 
* **It's worth exploring negotiation.**  There are 9 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to try and get Alice to lower her price.

**Next Step:** You'll need to make a counteroffer to Alice. Consider what price you're willing to start at and what your strategy will be if Alice rejects your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000, starting at that point is a clear signal of your intent. 
* **First round:**  This is your first counteroffer, so it's reasonable to start at your limit. 
* **Negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have more rounds to negotiate. You can adjust your counteroffers based on her responses. 

**Strategy:**  I'm taking a bold approach by going straight to my maximum price. This is a risky strategy, but it could lead to a quick agreement if Alice is willing to compromise. If she rejects, we'll need to adjust our strategy in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price.
* **More negotiation room:**  We have 7 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate and hopefully get a lower price.

**Next Step:**  You'll need to make a new counteroffer to Alice. Consider how much lower you can go while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:**  Instead of another huge jump down, I'm offering a smaller decrease from Alice's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within our budget.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer is a good way to gauge Alice's flexibility. If she accepts, great! If she rejects, we can adjust our strategy again for the next round.
* **Midpoint:**  $1,250,000 is roughly the midpoint between Alice's last offer and our maximum budget, leaving space for potential further negotiations.

**Strategy:**  By taking a more measured approach with our counteroffers, we can hopefully get a better price without jeopardizing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's moving closer to our desired price, it's still above our target.
* **Time for a counteroffer:** We have 5 rounds left, enough time to continue negotiating.

**Next Step:**  We need to make another counteroffer.  Since Alice is clearly willing to compromise, we should aim for a price closer to our budget, but with a little wiggle room in case she needs to come down further.  Let's aim for something around $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the pressure:** By offering $1,350,000, we're showing Alice that we're serious about getting a price closer to our budget. This also leaves some room for her to counter with a slightly higher offer.
* **Midpoint compromise:**  This counteroffer is the midpoint between Alice's last offer and our previous offer, demonstrating our willingness to find a compromise.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds left, it's time to push for a deal. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and close the gap quickly. If Alice rejects, we may have to consider a higher offer in the next round, but ideally, we'll get her to accept this one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still outside our target range.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have 3 rounds left, so time is getting tight. We need to be strategic. 
* **Potential for compromise:**  Alice has been consistently lowering her price, suggesting she might be willing to come down further.

**Next Step:**  We need to make a counteroffer that's closer to our budget but leaves room for a potential deal. Let's aim for $1,400,000, increasing the pressure and showing Alice that we're serious about getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer is a significant step closer to our budget, showing Alice that we're getting serious and willing to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is a good way to see if Alice is truly willing to come down further or if she's holding firm at $1,550,000.
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds left, we need to push for a deal. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and close the gap quickly.  If Alice rejects, we'll have to consider our options for the final round, including the possibility of buying from John. However, we're hopeful that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Even though she's lowering her price, it's still above our target range of $1,000,000.
* **Limited time:** We only have one round left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.
* **Guaranteed alternative:**  We have a guaranteed way to purchase the product for $1,000,000 from John.

**Conclusion:** It's more prudent to secure the product from John at our desired price rather than risk potentially losing the deal with Alice and ending up paying more."
