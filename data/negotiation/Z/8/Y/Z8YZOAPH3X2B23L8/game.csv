"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $19,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself on this. $13,500 is my final offer -  it's a great price for a product of this caliber.",13500.0,Alice,5,
