Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 allows for room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the value of the product subtly encourages Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind my minimum price of $8,000 and the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $8,500 is better than $8,000, it's still not ideal. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but I want to maximize my profits. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than $8,500, leaving room for potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  $9,250 still gives me some room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting that it's a ""great deal"" reinforces the worth of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $9,000 is significantly closer to my desired price than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Final offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with the lower offer from John. 

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting $9,000 is the best decision in this scenario to ensure a sale and maximize my profits."
