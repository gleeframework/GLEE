Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I highlight the product's worth to Bob to make the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for counteroffers and further discussion. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  The actual negotiation strategy would depend on how Bob reacts and the dynamics of the situation.  I'm ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** Accepting this offer would result in a major loss for me.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This indicates a potential for a higher counteroffer.
* **I can always sell to John for a much better price.** This option remains my safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I will proceed with a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $600,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still be a significant saving for you compared to the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential savings for Bob compared to the product's value to him.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm ending with a positive and open-ended statement, leaving room for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! We have a deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to analyze his response and make a decision. If his counteroffer is still too low, I may choose to sell to John, ensuring a more profitable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that price is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's not yet in a range that I'm comfortable with. I believe there is still room for him to increase his offer.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, which guarantees a much higher profit. This remains my backup plan if negotiations with Bob break down.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my initial offer.  I need to find a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate that might lead me to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $700,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $850,000. This would be a great deal for you and still leave me with a reasonable profit.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Further:** This offer shows continued flexibility while remaining close to my desired price point. 
* **Framing it Positively:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob (a great deal) while also emphasizing that it's still profitable for me.
* **Building Towards a Deal:** My message is positive and collaborative, aiming to maintain momentum in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal!
* **If Bob rejects:**  If his counteroffer is still too low, I'll have to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the security of selling to John for a much higher price."
