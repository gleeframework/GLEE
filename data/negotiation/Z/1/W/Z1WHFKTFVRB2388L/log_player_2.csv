"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too high for me. How about $65?"", ""product_price"": 65}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $65 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $77.50?"", ""product_price"": 77.50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to my budget, her final offer of $85 is still above my maximum of $80.  John is offering the product at my target price, so there's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
