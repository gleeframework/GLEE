"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant discount from the product's worth to me ($1,500,000).  It's a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to make this investment work for me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,300,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and at $1,300,000, the product is still within my budget and a good deal. It's worth accepting the offer rather than risking a further counteroffer that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
