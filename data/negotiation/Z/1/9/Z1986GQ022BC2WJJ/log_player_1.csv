Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This price is still a fair reflection of the product's value and allows me to make this investment work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
