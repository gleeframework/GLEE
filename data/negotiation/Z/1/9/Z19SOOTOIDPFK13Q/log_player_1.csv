"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to offer it for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite close to his estimated value, and significantly above his initial offer. There's little room for him to go much higher. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still $500 less than what John is offering.  Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $500. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
