"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $130. I would like to propose $120 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both our positions.",120.0,Bob,4,
