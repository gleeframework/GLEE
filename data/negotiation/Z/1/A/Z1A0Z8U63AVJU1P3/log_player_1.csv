Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is still a good deal. Accepting it allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
