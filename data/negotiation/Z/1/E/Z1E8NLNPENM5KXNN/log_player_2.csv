"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $170. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.
*  It's always better to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  
* Bob can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming for a price closer to his value of $100. Offering $120 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves room for some back-and-forth, allowing Alice to counter without immediately going to John. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message politely acknowledges Alice's offer but explains Bob's position, creating a foundation for continued negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $145 is still above Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While Alice is getting closer, there's still room for Bob to negotiate a lower price.
* **The Backup Option:**  Bob has the safety net of buying from John for $100, so there's no rush to accept an offer that's not in his best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, but still pushing for a price closer to his target.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Suggesting to split the difference between the last offer and Bob's counteroffer demonstrates a desire for a win-win outcome. 
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest in the product to encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable going as low as $132. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we go to $140? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum value of $100. 
* **Negotiations Continue:**  Alice is showing some flexibility, but there's still room for Bob to negotiate a lower price.
* **John is Always an Option:** Bob has the backup option of buying from John for $100, so he can continue to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I'm willing to go up to $135. That's the absolute highest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Interest:** The message emphasizes Bob's desire to make a deal and highlights his willingness to meet halfway.
* **Finality:**  The message hints at this being Bob's final offer, putting pressure on Alice to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $135 is the highest you're willing to go, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $135, which would be $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to the Limit:** While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $137.5 is still very close to Bob's absolute maximum of $135.
* **Risk of Continued Negotiation:**  There's a high risk that further negotiation will either lead to an even higher price or stall the deal.
* **The Safe Choice:**  Buying from John for $100 ensures that Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, without risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price. It's a safe and guaranteed way to achieve his goal."
