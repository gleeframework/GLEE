Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think?,170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132?  I'm very interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $132. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we go to $140? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still out of my budget.  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I'm willing to go up to $135. That's the absolute highest I can go. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is the highest you're willing to go, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $135, which would be $137.50. What do you think?",137.5,Alice,7,
