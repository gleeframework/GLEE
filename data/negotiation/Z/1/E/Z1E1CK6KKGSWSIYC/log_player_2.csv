"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1800000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is a fair starting point given my limitations.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows my serious intent to buy but also sets a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I've provided a reason for my low offer, acknowledging my budget constraints. This helps build a foundation for a more productive negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys that I am open to discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my maximum.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget constraints and the potential value you've described.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is my maximum budget, showing a clear commitment to buying the product.

* **Closing Tone:** The message is positive and suggests a willingness to finalize the deal at this price."
