"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but at this point, with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't have time to negotiate further.  It's better to accept John's offer and ensure a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
