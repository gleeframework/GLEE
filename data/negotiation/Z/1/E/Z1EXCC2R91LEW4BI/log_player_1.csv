"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so this is a reasonable starting point. I'll be prepared to adjust if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can find a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to show some flexibility but still try to maintain a good profit.  $18,000 is a more realistic price that still allows for a good margin. If Bob accepts, great! If not, we'll keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm willing to risk another round to try and reach a more favorable agreement.  I believe the product is worth more to me than $16,500, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm on a price that gives me a decent profit.  This is a good compromise and shows willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal. I'm getting close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk another round. The clock is ticking, and I don't want to lose the opportunity to sell to Bob.  $16,000 is a fair price that ensures a good profit, so I'm happy to accept."
