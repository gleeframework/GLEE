"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $800,000? It's the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value for the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
