"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1,100,000. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you see in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
