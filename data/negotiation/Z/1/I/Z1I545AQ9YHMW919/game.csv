"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. ",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, the product's intrinsic worth and potential are considerably higher than your valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and acknowledges the product's true value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,150,000 remains outside my price range. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which I believe is a fair price reflecting the product's potential while staying within my budget. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
