"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'd accept ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also framing the message to emphasize the value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the need to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This approach aims to show flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still need to get closer to my goal of $800,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my minimum target.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing fairness and the need to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Since we're at the halfway point of the negotiation, I'm aiming for a final decision in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. How about we meet at $780,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 just doesn't work for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $790,000? This represents a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 790000}
```

I'm offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still lower than my minimum. I'm framing the message as a final concession and emphasizing a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept. With only a few rounds left, I want to push for a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $790,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and $790,000, so how about we settle at $785,000? I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my goal. I've already made significant concessions, and it seems we're stuck at an impasse.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of getting a lower offer from Bob."
