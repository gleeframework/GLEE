"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $750,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my minimum target.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $775,000. How about we meet at $780,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 just doesn't work for me.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $790,000? This represents a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $790,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and $790,000, so how about we settle at $785,000? I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",785000.0,Bob,8,
