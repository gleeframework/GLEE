"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it's also a price that reflects the value of the product to me.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is way too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. It's still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to what I want. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is still too low for me, but I'm starting to get worried that I might not get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'll need to think carefully about my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $125. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still higher than my minimum price of $120.  I'm hoping that this is a sweet spot that Bob will find appealing. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to find a compromise."
