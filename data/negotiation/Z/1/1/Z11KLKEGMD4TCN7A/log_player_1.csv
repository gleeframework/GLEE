"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $12,500.  How about $13,500? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value you've indicated. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still unable to go below $13,250. This price reflects the product's value and my need to cover my costs. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it benefits both of us. Please consider my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $12800? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,800 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that I may not be able to reach a satisfactory price.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid any further risk of a lower price."
