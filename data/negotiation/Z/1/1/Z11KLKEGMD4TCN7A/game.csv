"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $12500.  How about $13500? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value you've indicated. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $13000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, I'm still unable to go below $13250. This price reflects the product's value and my need to cover my costs. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it benefits both of us. Please consider my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $12800? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product and the price I'm willing to pay.",12800.0,Bob,6,
