Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a unique opportunity to [briefly highlight key benefits for Bob].  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  My starting price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I could do $1,050,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, it's worth exploring a counteroffer and seeing if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
