"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is far above my budget. Given the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1500000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
