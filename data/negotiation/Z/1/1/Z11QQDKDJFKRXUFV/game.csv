"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you're placing on the product. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I can meet you at $14,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
