Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $150, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to gauge his interest level and potential willingness to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer of $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a fair price that still allows me to earn more than my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than John's offer and closer to my desired range.  It's better to secure a sale than to risk further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
