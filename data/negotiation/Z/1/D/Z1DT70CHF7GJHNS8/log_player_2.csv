"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There are still 9 rounds left, giving you room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you understanding the value of this product to me.  However, I'm not able to go that high right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured, while still leaving me some wiggle room to move up if needed.
* **Clear Message:** I'm acknowledging the value of the product to me, while also stating my financial limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to pay over my budget of $10,000. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate that.  However,  $10,200 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, my maximum limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my maximum budget, demonstrating my commitment while making it clear that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Focus on the Deal:** I'm not dwelling on previous offers, just focusing on the current situation.
* **Opportunity for Alice:** I'm giving Alice a clear path to acceptance. If she values the sale, she may be willing to accept my final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge further from her price, and I'm at my maximum budget. Given that I can buy the same product from John for $10,000, it makes sense to take that option.  There's no guarantee that continuing negotiations with Alice will get me a better price, and I'm risking the chance of losing out on the product entirely if we can't agree."
