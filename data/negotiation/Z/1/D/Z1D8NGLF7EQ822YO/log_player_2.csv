"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice is willing to come down further, and I have 9 rounds left to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer than her initial offer. I want to see if I can get her down further before committing. I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,800. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price. However, I'm still holding firm on trying to get a price below $9,000. With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is within my budget. While I would prefer to pay less, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and me potentially having to buy from John at $12,000 is too high. With 5 rounds left, I'm confident that this is a good deal, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
