Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:** Offering $140 gives Bob a chance to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Guaranteed Sale at $150:**  You have a guaranteed sale with John at $150, so there's no need to drastically undervalue the product for Bob."
