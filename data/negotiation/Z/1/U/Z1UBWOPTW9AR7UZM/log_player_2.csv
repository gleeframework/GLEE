"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her value for the product, you can get a better deal by buying from John for $100."
