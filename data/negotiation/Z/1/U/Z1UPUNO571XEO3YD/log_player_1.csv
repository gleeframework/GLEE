Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation, as it's lower than what the product is worth to Bob. It's also significantly higher than my minimum value, giving me some wiggle room. I'm curious to see if he'll accept or counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still above my minimum of $80 and it's likely that I won't get a better offer from him in the next round.  It's also closer to my initial asking price, so accepting is a good choice in this case."
