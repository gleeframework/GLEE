"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while still leaving a comfortable margin for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
