{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a decent profit.
* **""Great deal"":** This is a positive framing to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **""Let me know what you think!"":** This encourages Bob to respond and start a conversation.

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if Bob rejects my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and below my target profit. 

I choose to reject his offer because:

* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, I can counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more favorable agreement.
* **Minimizing losses:**  Selling at $9,500 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and initiating another round of negotiation, I can leverage my position and attempt to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This acknowledges Bob's offer and shows a willingness to negotiate, but still emphasizes my position of wanting a higher price.
* **Fair price:** By framing it as a ""fair"" price, I imply that it's mutually beneficial and a good deal for both parties.
* **$11,000:** This is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while maintaining a profitable price for me. 
* **Moving forward:** This emphasizes the desired outcome of closing the deal and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously. 

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still keeping my profit in mind. It also demonstrates a willingness to meet Bob halfway, potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion. How about $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it still represents a significant loss for me. 

I choose to **RejectOffer** because:

* **Potential for better deal:** I can still counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **Minimizing losses:**  Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of my potential profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I can continue to negotiate and try to achieve a more favorable outcome. If Bob refuses to budge, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $11,500. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Understanding:** This acknowledges Bob's position, showing that I'm listening to his concerns.
* **Minimum:**  I reiterate my minimum price to emphasize my need for a higher figure.
* **Compromise:**  By offering $11,500, I show flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Good Compromise:** This framing positions the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Finalizing the deal:** This encourages Bob to accept and end the negotiation. 

By counter-offering at $11,500, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that would allow for a successful transaction while still maintaining a decent profit for myself. This offer also demonstrates my willingness to compromise and ultimately close the deal."
