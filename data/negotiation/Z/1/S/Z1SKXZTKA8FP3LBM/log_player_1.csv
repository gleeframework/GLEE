"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's on offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.  I don't want to start so high that it's insulting or immediately makes him walk away.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence about the product's value is crucial to potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By using the phrase ""starting price,"" I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts my initial offer, or we agree on a price closer to my asking price.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product but can only go as high as $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your potential returns. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his initial perceived value but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can secure a better deal. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my safety net but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get a price closer to my target by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $200,000, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** Even though it's a reduction, my counteroffer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than his offer. This keeps a higher price point in play (anchoring).
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Proposing a ""meeting in the middle"" approach often resonates as fair and encourages agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential value to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.

By striking this balance, I'm aiming to:

1. **Keep Bob Engaged:** I want to avoid countering too low and losing his interest.
2. **Move Towards My Target:** The goal is to gradually bring the negotiation closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000 while still allowing room for further compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,500,000.  This price allows both of us to make a decent profit and ensures a successful transaction.  I'm confident this is a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the potential of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
