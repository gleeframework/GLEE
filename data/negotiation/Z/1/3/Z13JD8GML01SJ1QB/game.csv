"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I'm ready to make a deal if we can reach a price closer to my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However,  $10000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $12500. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal today.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. Let's try to find that sweet spot.  I'm willing to go down to $11500.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm eager to make this happen. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to make a final offer of $11000. If this works for you, we can close the deal today.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,
