Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $10000? I'm ready to make a deal if we can reach a price closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal today.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
