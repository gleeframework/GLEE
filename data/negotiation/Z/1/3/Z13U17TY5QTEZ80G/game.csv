"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this works for you!",85.0,Alice,5,
