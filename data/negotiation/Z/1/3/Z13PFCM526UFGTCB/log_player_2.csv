"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $11,000. I believe it presents a great value at this price point, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to compromise and find a price that works for both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $10,200? This allows me to make a fair deal while acknowledging its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,200, which is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still within Bob's budget. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings from a few more rounds of negotiation.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
