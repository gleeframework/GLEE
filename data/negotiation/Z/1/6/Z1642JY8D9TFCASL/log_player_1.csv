"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what Bob values the product at. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Attractive Offer:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he values the product at $8,000.  This makes it more likely for him to consider the offer.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to foster a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, as I've set a price that leaves room for compromise. 

**Important Note:**  I'm starting with a high price but I'm prepared to come down in subsequent rounds if necessary. However, if negotiations stall or become unproductive, I will sell the product to John for $15,000 to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I consider fair. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale. This maintains leverage for me in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter with a price that is closer to my desired price, but still takes into account Bob's willingness to negotiate. I will also continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $10,500 is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit while acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. This helps to keep the negotiation positive and avoids appearing overly stubborn.

**Strategy:**

* **Gradual Reduction:**  I'm gradually reducing my asking price to encourage Bob to increase his offer.  
* **Monitoring Progress:** I'm carefully monitoring Bob's responses to gauge his interest and adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly. 
* **Prepared for John:** I remain prepared to sell to John at any time to ensure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my desired price point.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I continue to reject Bob's offers, I risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of time. 

**Important Note:** 
While I'd prefer a higher price, I believe accepting this offer is the most sensible decision at this point. It secures a profit that's close to my minimum acceptable value and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiations that could stall."
