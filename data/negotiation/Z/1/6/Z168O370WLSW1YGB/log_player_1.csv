"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get more from him. While his offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price reflects the value this product offers, while still leaving room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price in the next rounds, as the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a higher price. The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and I'm confident I can reach a more mutually beneficial deal. I'll continue to negotiate in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $1,080,000 just doesn't reflect the value this product brings to you. How about $1,090,000?  It's a fair compromise and ensures a profitable deal for both of us. Let's finalize this agreement, shall we?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations are getting frustrating. Bob is not willing to pay a price that reflects the product's value to him.  I have reached my limit, and I am now at risk of losing too much money.  It is better to accept John's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000.  This way, I will secure a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of losing even more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
