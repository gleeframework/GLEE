Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $120 is better than selling to John for $100,  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Reasoning:** It's early in the negotiation, and I want to leave room for potential counteroffers. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  $125 is closer to my initial asking price of $150 and significantly more than selling to John for $100. 
* **Reasoning:**  We're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation, and I'm confident that further negotiation might not yield a much better price.  
* **Next Steps:**  The deal is closed!  I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirement and allows me to make a decent profit."
