Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a substantial investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to acquiring this product. I'm hopeful we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees I get my $1,000,000 and avoids further negotiation rounds."
