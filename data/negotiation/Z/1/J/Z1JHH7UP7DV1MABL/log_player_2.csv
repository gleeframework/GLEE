"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a significant discount, and I'll still be able to recoup a substantial portion of its value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
