"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. You can reject the offer and see if she's willing to lower the price, aiming for something closer to $100."
