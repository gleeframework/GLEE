Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting the offer at $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message:** This message is friendly but also establishes the value of the product in your eyes. It leaves room for Bob to respond with a counteroffer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. We need to see Bob's response before deciding on further actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **RejectOffer:** While $15,000 is your minimum value, it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your initial asking price. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Next Steps:** By rejecting the offer, you can send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your desired $20,000. This shows you're willing to negotiate while still protecting your interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $18,000. This reflects the product's value and would be a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a compromise price that is halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **The message:** The message acknowledges Bob's position and emphasizes the value of the product. It also leaves room for further negotiation.

**Important Note:**  Now we need to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still a bit hesitant at $18000.  I'm willing to go up to $16000, which I think is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **AcceptOffer:**  Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum value of $15,000 and only slightly lower than your last counteroffer. 
* **Reasoning:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob completely and being forced to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and satisfactory sale."
