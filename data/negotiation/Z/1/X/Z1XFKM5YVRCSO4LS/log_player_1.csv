Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $82 for the product.

While Bob's offer of $82 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold, and further haggling might not yield a significantly better result. I'd rather take the guaranteed $80 from John."
