{

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for countering.  I'm happy to meet somewhere in the middle, but $140 is still pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly staying above your $120 limit. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly in the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed option with John at $120, ensuring you don't overpay."
