"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $18,000 is quite steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $14,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still looking to get a good profit from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference - $12,750 and we have a deal?",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good value for the product.",13200.0,Alice,7,
