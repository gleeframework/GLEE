Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to my minimum ($15,000).
* **Value to Bob:** The price is still within Bob's range ($12,000 value) making it somewhat attractive.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage and a clear exit strategy if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for me to increase the price.
* **John's Offer:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, I don't need to rush into accepting Bob's offer. 

I will counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, I'm aiming for a price closer to $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Offering $13,500 presents a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000).
* **Attractive for Bob:** The price is still within Bob's perceived value range, making it a potentially attractive option.
* **Increased Chance of Acceptance:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which might increase Bob's chances of accepting.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum of $15,000, keeping me in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,200 is only $1,800 away from my minimum price. While tempting, the negotiation has gone back and forth with little progress.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a guaranteed return that exceeds my minimum.
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation with Bob could take more time and energy, potentially delaying the sale and impacting my overall profit.

Selling to John guarantees me a higher return with minimal risk and effort."
