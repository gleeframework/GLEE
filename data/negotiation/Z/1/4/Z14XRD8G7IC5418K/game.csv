"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on profit. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
