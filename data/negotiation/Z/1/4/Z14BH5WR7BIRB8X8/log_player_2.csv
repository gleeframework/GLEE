Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $112.50? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.

While Alice's offer is better than her previous offer, it is still higher than what you are willing to pay. It is worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I think we were close at $112.50, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $111.50? That's the best I can do.

You have three options:

While you'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $111.5 is still a good deal considering John's price of $120.  It's time to accept and move on."
