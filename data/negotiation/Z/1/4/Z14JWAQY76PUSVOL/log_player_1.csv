{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth a lot to you. I'm confident this price is fair, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  
* **It shows you are serious:**  You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, indicating you're open to a deal.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:**  You have a good starting point, and Bob has incentive to negotiate. 
* **Avoid a quick exit:**  You haven't immediately gone to John, keeping the potential for a higher deal with Bob open.

Let me know if you want me to generate a counteroffer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Here's why:

* **Potential for a higher price:** Even though Bob is offering the minimum, there's still a chance to get closer to your desired $950,000. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  Rejecting his offer shows you're not desperate and that you're willing to walk away if necessary. This can make him more willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price somewhere between $800,000 and $950,000. This shows you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price.

**Example Counteroffer:**

""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."""
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Communicates value:** It emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Invites further negotiation:**  It uses language that invites Bob to continue the conversation. 

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** You're not accepting Bob's initial offer, showing you're not desperate.
* **Increase your chances of a better deal:** This counteroffer could push Bob to raise his price or at least come closer to your desired price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $825,000, which is only $25,000 away from your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer for the following reasons:

* **Close to your minimum:** You're getting very close to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited room for further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a deadlock or force you to sell to John. 
* **Time is a factor:** Prolonging the negotiation could lead to a loss of time and potential for other buyers to emerge.

**Next Steps:**

While you're accepting the offer, you could also try to negotiate a slightly better price with Bob. You could mention something like: ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to accept it, but I would be happier with $830,000.  What do you think?""

This final push could get you closer to your ideal price, but it's also possible Bob will stick with his offer."
