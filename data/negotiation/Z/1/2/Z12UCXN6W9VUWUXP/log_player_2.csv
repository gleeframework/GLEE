Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit higher than my previous counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Alice sees the value in closing the deal without going too much lower than her desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While I'd prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate could drag things out and increase the risk of Alice walking away.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids potential delays or losing the deal entirely."
