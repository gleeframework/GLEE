"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, as it aligns better with my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to sell the product for $1,050,000, that's still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and close the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
