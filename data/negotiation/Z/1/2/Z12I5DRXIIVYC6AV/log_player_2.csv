{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is within my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, as it aligns better with my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to sell the product for $1,050,000, that's still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially getting stuck with a higher price than what John is offering. It's safer to secure the product at $1,000,000 from John, as it's within my budget and ensures I don't overpay."
