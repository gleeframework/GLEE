"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain my product's value. I am unable to lower the price below $11,000. However, I am open to discussing additional benefits or terms that might make the product more appealing within your budget.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you considering my situation.  However, $11,000 is really pushing my absolute limit.  To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a price that's more manageable. If you can come down a bit more, I'm still interested.  Otherwise, I may have to go with the other option.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. It seems like we're almost there.  To be completely transparent, I've found a comparable product for $10,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  It's important for me to work with someone I trust, and I've enjoyed our conversations so far.",10000.0,Bob,6,
