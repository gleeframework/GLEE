"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your needs perfectly and I believe it's worth every penny. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm on a tight budget and  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the product for as cheap as possible, so we're starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000). This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states our budget constraints. This sets the tone for a respectful but firm negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain my product's value. I am unable to lower the price below $11,000. However, I am open to discussing additional benefits or terms that might make the product more appealing within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is sticking to $11,000, and we're not willing to go that high.  We need to signal we're willing to walk away to make progress.
* **John's Offer is Close:** We have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John.  There's not much room left to negotiate with Alice before her price becomes worse than John's. 
* **Next Move is Key:** Rejecting again puts the pressure on Alice.  She'll need to decide if she wants to lose the sale or come down in price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you considering my situation.  However, $11,000 is really pushing my absolute limit.  To be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for a price that's more manageable. If you can come down a bit more, I'm still interested.  Otherwise, I may have to go with the other option."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:**  We're letting Alice know that we have a viable alternative and are seriously considering it. This should motivate her to be more flexible.
* **Not Revealing John's Price:** We're being vague about the ""other option"" to avoid giving away our bargaining power. 
* **Raising Slightly:** We're increasing our offer slightly to $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for negotiation to reach our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your feedback, Bob. I understand your financial constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a middle ground at $10,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close, But Not There Yet:** Alice is finally moving down, but $10,500 is still more than John's offer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We've consistently rejected offers above $10,000, showing Alice we're serious about our budget. 
* **Final Push:**  We'll make one more counteroffer closer to John's price to see if Alice is truly willing to negotiate. If not, we'll go with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. It seems like we're almost there.  To be completely transparent, I've found a comparable product for $10,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  It's important for me to work with someone I trust, and I've enjoyed our conversations so far."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're presenting this as our best and final offer to signal we're serious about walking away.
* **Revealing John's Price (Almost):** We're not explicitly saying it's John, but we're strongly implying there's another offer for $10,000. This puts the pressure on Alice.
* **Appeal to Relationship:** We're adding a bit of emotional appeal by mentioning trust and the positive interactions to make saying ""yes"" feel good. 

**Outcome:**

Now, it's up to Alice. She'll need to decide if losing the sale entirely is worth holding out for a slightly higher price."
