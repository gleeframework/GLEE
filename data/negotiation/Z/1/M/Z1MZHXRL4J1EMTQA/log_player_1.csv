{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit above what I know it's worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that far down. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $150? This price would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice! However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I've decided to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it, and I don't want to keep negotiating lower. John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is my minimum."
