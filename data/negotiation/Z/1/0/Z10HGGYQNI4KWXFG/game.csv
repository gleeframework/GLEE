"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",85.0,Bob,4,
