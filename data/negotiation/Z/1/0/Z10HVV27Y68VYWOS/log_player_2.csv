This price reflects its high quality and unique features, while ensuring you get a great value for your money. I believe this offer will be beneficial for both of us.

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further in a counter-offer."
