"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me is $12,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $13,000.  That's still a great price for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering its worth to me is $12,000.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'll offer you the product for $12,750.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll offer $12,500 again, but I'm willing to throw in an extra $200 to sweeten the deal. I'll give you $12,700 for the product. Let's see if we can meet on this price.",12700.0,Bob,6,
