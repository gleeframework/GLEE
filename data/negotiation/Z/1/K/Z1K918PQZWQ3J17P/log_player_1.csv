"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, but also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable.  I'm confident in my product and want to maximize my profit.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffer isn't reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of him. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm still aiming for a good profit, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my desired price. I'm happy to accept his offer of $14,600.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  I'm also running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk having to sell to John for $12,000."
