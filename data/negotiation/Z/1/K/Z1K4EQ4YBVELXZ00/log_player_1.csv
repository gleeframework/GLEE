"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum of $12,000, I still have room to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
