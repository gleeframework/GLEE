Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
