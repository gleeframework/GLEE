"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this time.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $1,300,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiating further might be risky:**  Alice has already rejected a lower offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk her walking away entirely. 
* **The price is close to Bob's desired price:** While not the absolute lowest possible, $1,300,000 represents a significant saving compared to John's offer. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a fair price without risking further negotiation."
