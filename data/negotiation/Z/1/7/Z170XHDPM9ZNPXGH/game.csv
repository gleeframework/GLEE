"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your desire for a more reasonable price. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
