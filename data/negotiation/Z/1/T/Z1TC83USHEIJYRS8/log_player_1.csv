"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for bargaining. It also gives a reason for the price, highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent price, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80). I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has expressed interest and is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of a lower offer or a deal falling through is higher than the potential gain from pushing for a higher price at this point."
