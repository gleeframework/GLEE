"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it holds great potential for your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a high offer from him.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob's business, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation, as I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling it for $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $1,200,000 is still more than my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial asking price and leaves less room for profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 8 rounds left. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer shows his interest in the product.  I can use this to my advantage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:** I'm meeting Bob halfway to show a willingness to compromise but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the win-win potential of the deal. 
* **Building on Interest:** I'm building on Bob's interest from the previous round by offering a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $1250000? This would allow me to make a fair investment without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.  I have room to negotiate further.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Bob continues to negotiate, demonstrating his interest.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting this offer, I can potentially counter with a price closer to $1,300,000 in the next round, further testing Bob's commitment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise to highlight that I'm working towards a fair deal for both of us.
* **Building Towards Agreement:** I'm continuing to work towards an agreement while leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob is unwilling to move higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach an agreement at $1300000. This price allows me to invest in the product while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price range and significantly above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might walk away, or his next offer might be lower.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's more strategic to accept this offer and secure a good price.

While I could continue negotiating, accepting this offer minimizes risk and ensures a profitable outcome for me."
