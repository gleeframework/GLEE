"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  That's a fair compromise and it gives you a great price on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

At this point, Alice's offer matches your best alternative (buying from John).  There's no point in further negotiation unless you think you can get the price even lower."
