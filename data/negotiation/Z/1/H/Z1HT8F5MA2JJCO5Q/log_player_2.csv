You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.

While $12,000 is a better price than $13,000, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal, closer to his desired price point."
