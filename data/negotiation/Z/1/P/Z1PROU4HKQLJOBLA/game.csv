"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is my minimum price. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $1100000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1150000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, and $1150000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1150000 and $1250000, which is $1200000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1175000. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal, but I'm really not able to go higher. Let's see if we can finally close this deal!",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $1175000 is enough for me to sell the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
