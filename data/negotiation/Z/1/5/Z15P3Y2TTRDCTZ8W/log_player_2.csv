"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This extraordinary item holds immense value to me, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs and aspirations. Given its significance and rarity, I am extending this offer with the understanding that it aligns well with your perceived worth of $1,000,000.

I am proposing to sell the product to you at a price that reflects its true value while considering your assessment. My offer stands at $1,200,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also leaves room for both of us to benefit from this exchange.

Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations, and we can proceed with the details of the transaction. I am confident that together, we can make this a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice
