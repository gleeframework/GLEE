"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but $9000 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,7,
