Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While we could sell to John for $150, there's a chance Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.  
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject $140. However, the potential reward of getting more than $150 makes it a calculated risk."
