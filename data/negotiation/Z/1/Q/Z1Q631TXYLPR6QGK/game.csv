"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise further on the price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of the product, $825000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $750000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential value we've both discussed. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is still a bit above your comfort zone.
