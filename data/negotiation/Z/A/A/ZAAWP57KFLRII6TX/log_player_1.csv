"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts with a good profit margin for Alice while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. It also opens the conversation with a friendly and encouraging tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is aiming for a higher price than $14,000, and rejecting Bob's offer allows her to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially driving the price up.  Selling to John is also an option, but Alice wants to maximize her profit, so she'll try to negotiate with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit too high for me. How about $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still aiming for a price closer to her initial offer of $18,000.  While $13,500 is better than John's offer, she can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached a point where she has to make a decision. While she is still aiming for a higher price,  Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to her minimum value of $15,000.  At this point, it's safer to secure the deal with Bob rather than risk a lower price from John or a breakdown in negotiations."
