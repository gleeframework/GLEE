Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. Buying from John at $12,000 ensures you stay within your budget."
