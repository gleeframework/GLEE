"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob is going for a significant price reduction to test Alice's flexibility. 
* **Reasoning:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes interest in the product while establishing a lower price point. 
* **Strategic:** This approach pushes Alice to either accept the counteroffer or make a new counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $11,000 is a good deal for Bob considering his $15,000 backup option.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially yield a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and ending up with a higher price from John outweighs the potential for a small additional savings."
