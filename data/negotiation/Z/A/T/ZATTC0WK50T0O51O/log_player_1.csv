Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. My counteroffer for the product would be $700,000.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount that John is guaranteed to pay. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob, as he's unlikely to go much higher and we risk him lowering his offer further. Taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John is the safest and most logical choice now."
