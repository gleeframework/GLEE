"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60."", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I'm willing to accept. How about $100? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer."", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $75 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $90 to meet halfway. It's a great deal for a high-quality product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $80 fallback option with John.  It's unlikely she'll reach a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  Cutting off the negotiation and going with John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
