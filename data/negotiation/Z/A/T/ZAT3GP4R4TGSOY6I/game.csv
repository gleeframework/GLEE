"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I'm willing to accept. How about $100? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value, but I have a strict budget. How about $75? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
