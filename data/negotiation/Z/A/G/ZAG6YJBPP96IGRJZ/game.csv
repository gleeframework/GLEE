"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget allows me to only consider offers within $10000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $15000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we discuss $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose $17000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. I can do $18500, which is a bit above your last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I believe we're getting closer. I would like to counter with $18000 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable compromise considering the value you place on it.",18000.0,Bob,6,
