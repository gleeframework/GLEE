"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider purchasing it at a special introductory price of $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You're aiming for $8,000 and Alice's first offer is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your interest and the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $9,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering your offer, I propose we settle on a price of $8,900 for the product. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while ensuring you receive a good value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,900 is very close to your ideal price, you are still within your budget and have several rounds left. It's worth trying to get that final $100 off."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're both getting closer to an agreement.  I'm very happy with the progress we've made, but I'm still hoping we can reach my ideal price point. How about $8,800?  This would be a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're pleased with the progress. I'm also committed to reaching a fair agreement. Considering your latest offer, I suggest we finalize the transaction at $8,850 for the product. This price respects both our interests and allows for a smooth closing of the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is offering a price that is within your budget and very close to your ideal price.  You have a few rounds left, but the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately not being able to get a better deal is too high.  It's best to accept her offer and secure the product."
