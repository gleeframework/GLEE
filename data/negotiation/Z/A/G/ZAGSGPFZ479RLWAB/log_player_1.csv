Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. While $115 is closer to my budget, I still can't go above $100. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that price?

Bob is firmly rooted at $100 and unlikely to budge. It's not worth further negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John."
