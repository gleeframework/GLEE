Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's still significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $13,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $13,000. This is a compromise, but still a profitable deal for me. It's also a fair price, considering his offer of $12,000 was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome, even if it means missing out on potentially earning more from Bob."
