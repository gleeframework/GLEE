Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $85? I think it's a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay.

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. At this point, John's offer is more appealing for getting the product at the best price."
