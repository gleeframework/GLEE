,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it looks great, $120 is a bit outside my budget. Could we agree on a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $85? I think it's a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay.",85.0,Alice,5,
