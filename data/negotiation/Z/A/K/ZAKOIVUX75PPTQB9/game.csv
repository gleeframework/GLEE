"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive with my offer. How about $8500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",9000.0,Bob,6,
