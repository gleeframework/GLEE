Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more aggressive with my offer. How about $8500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is offering $9,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions and it seems we're at an impasse.  Rather than risk further negotiations, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my minimum."
