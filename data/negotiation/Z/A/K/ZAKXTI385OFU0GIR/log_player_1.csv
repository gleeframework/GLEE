Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $100 is above your minimum of $80, so you'd still make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $100 is less than Bob's value of $120, leaving room for potential negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement.

This approach sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, but you can always fall back on John's offer of $80 if you feel the deal with Bob isn't going anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is above your minimum of $80 and is a good compromise. It's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
