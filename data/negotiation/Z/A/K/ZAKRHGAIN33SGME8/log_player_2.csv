"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and might get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $100 is a reasonable opening move. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your desire for a lower price. This opens the door for negotiation, potentially finding a middle ground that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. While I'd prefer a lower price, $110 is within my budget and a decent saving compared to the initial price.  Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds and the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer."
