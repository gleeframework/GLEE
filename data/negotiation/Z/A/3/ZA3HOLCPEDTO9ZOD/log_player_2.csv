"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand its worth to you is quite substantial, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. My asking price is $1,000,000. This price allows for a good margin for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.  If not, I will be selling it to another interested party for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Alice claims she'll sell the product to another party for $800,000 if you refuse. This is likely a tactic to pressure you into accepting the $1,000,000 offer.  It's unlikely she'd accept a loss when she knows the product is worth more to you.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable. This opens the door for further negotiation with Alice.
* **John as a backup:** While buying from John is your maximum budget, it's a safety net.  There's a chance you can get a better deal from Alice."
