Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get more than $100 if he accepts. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your minimum price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy balances risk and potential reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but there's also a chance he'll accept it or counter-offer with a price still higher than your guaranteed $100 from John."
