"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $8000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $8200 is tempting, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us. How about $8100? It's a small step closer to your last offer, and it's the absolute highest I can go right now.",8100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8150. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",8150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $8150 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $8100, which is a fair compromise considering our discussions. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider my other options. ",8100.0,Bob,8,
