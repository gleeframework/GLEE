"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still below the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable justification:**  I'm providing a reason for the price, emphasizing ""fairness"" to create a positive initial impression. 
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still a good deal:** While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate further, and I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John now would leave me with a smaller profit.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $110, he's still getting a good deal.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" and emphasizing that it's ""closer to what I need"" to make it worthwhile, implying that I'm willing to make a small concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're already in Round 4, and the negotiation is likely to continue back and forth. 
* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob is firmly sticking to $100, and while I'd prefer more, it's still a good deal for me, and the risk of further negotiation getting stuck is high.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would mean a lower profit. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Accepting now frees up time to potentially find another buyer later who might be willing to pay more.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good profit and minimize the risk of losing the sale altogether."
