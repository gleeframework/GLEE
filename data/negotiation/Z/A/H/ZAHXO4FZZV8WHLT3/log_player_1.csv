"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially close the deal for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for more.  I believe I can get closer to my target by counter-offering. It's also worth noting that selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and gives me some room to negotiate. My hope is that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target by counter-offering.  I'm also not desperate, as I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but only slightly to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to meet me halfway at this point, and I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$980,000 is a good price, but I'm still holding out for $1,000,000.  I've already demonstrated my willingness to compromise, and I believe I can push for just a bit more. I also know that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept this offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

I'm going to make one final push with a counteroffer of $1,020,000. This is only $20,000 away from my goal and demonstrates that I'm serious about closing the deal. It also gives Bob a chance to make a slight compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob is only willing to go up to $990,000. While this is close to my target, it's still not quite there.  Since I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm going to take the guaranteed deal. It's the most logical choice considering the limited time and the possibility of a failed negotiation."
