``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is getting very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price. While she'd ideally like to get more, accepting his offer of $1,725,000 is a good business decision for these reasons: 

* **Significant Profit:**  Alice is still making a substantial profit above the product's value to her ($1,500,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out negotiations further risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the profit. 
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and he might even lower his offer in later rounds. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with a worse outcome later."
