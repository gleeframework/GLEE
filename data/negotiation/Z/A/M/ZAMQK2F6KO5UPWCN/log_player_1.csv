Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which could help build rapport and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum and my initial offer. This shows I'm flexible but still firm on my value for the product. I'm also keeping the conversation friendly and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $175 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and it's possible I could end up selling to John for the same price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and clean sale at my minimum price."
