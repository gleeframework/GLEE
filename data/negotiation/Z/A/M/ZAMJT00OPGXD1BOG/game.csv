"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm currently looking to spend less.  I'm happy to offer $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
