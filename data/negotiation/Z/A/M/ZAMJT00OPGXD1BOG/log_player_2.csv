"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price. There's no benefit to accepting it right away. We should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, which is a good sign. However, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,120,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my target:** At $1,120,000, the price is only $20,000 above my last counteroffer and within a reasonable range of what I'm willing to pay.
* **Further negotiation might be futile:** While I could try to counteroffer again,  it seems likely that Alice is firm on her bottom line. Further negotiation might result in a stalemate or a price closer to John's offer.
* **Accepting saves time and effort:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows me to secure the product without risking further negotiation that might not yield a better price. 

Overall, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic and time-efficient choice, considering the potential for continued negotiation and the risk of ending up paying John's higher price."
