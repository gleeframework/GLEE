"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 is too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows for a good return for me, while giving you a significant value proposition.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Let's try $825,000. It's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects that.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $800,000. I think that's a very fair price and allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
