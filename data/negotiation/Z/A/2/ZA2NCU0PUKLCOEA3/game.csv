"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the benefits the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,050,000. Considering the value it brings to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the benefits the product will bring to your company.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
