Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might value it higher, or be willing to negotiate up from a lower starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative in mind:**  We have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. This gives us leverage in the negotiation with Bob. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum."
