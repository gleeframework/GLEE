"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still get a good return while remaining within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, and I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you. However, considering the value I've attached to this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow you to still make a good profit while keeping the transaction within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the value I've attached to this product, but it's a bit more reasonable than my previous offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. While I value the product,  $1,025,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's work together to make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting close to meeting you in the middle, but I still need to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
