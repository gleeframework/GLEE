Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could maximize our potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message subtly implies the product's high demand by referencing a ""unique value proposition."" This might encourage Bob to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is willing to risk a slightly lower profit margin for the chance to make a larger profit from Bob."
