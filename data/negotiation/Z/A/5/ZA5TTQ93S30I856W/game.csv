"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7000. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $7000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? This price still allows me to make a decent profit while being fair to you. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I think this price is a good compromise and allows us to meet in the middle.",7500.0,Bob,4,
