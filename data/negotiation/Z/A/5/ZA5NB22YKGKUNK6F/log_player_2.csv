"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate down towards a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's still above her value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a lower number, we aim to influence Alice's perception of a reasonable price range. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys our interest while making it clear we're looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price we'd consider, but we still have room to negotiate.  While $12,500 is closer to our starting budget, we made a strong initial counter-offer. We should continue to push for a lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to move towards Alice's price while still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties and signal a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Still Below Budget:**  Even if Alice accepts this offer, we'll be well below our $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product.  I'm happy to work towards a fair deal. How about $12,100? That's a significant discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but every dollar saved counts! Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're still above her known value for the product. We've got time for another counteroffer before considering accepting a price higher than our previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'd be willing to close the deal at $11,900. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11900
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** This counteroffer makes a smaller concession than previous rounds, signaling that we are nearing our bottom line.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" can encourage Alice to accept, especially if she's eager to close the deal. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're over halfway through the rounds.  This offer keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving some room to go up slightly if needed."
