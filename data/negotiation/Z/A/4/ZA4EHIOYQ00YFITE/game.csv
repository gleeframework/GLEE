"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
