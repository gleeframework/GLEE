"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $10,000 is still a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000), making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Opening the Conversation:** I'm not just throwing out a number, but also opening the conversation with a friendly message that acknowledges Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and also below my initial offer of $10,000.  Accepting this would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows interest and opens up the opportunity for further negotiation. 
* **Time for a Counter-Offer:** I have 10 rounds, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $10,000 was a bit high.  However, $6,000 is simply too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers.  This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Offer:**  $8,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at this price."
