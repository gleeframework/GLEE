**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value this product brings. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than my initial counteroffer.  With only 5 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate further.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's worth accepting this offer to avoid risking a deal with John at a much higher price."
