"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm looking for a price around $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  How about we split the difference at $9,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it would let us both walk away feeling good about the deal.",9875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,875 is still a bit low for me considering the value this product brings.  I could be persuaded to go down to $10,000 even.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
