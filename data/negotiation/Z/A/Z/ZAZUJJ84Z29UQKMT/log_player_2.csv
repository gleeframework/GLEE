Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

Round 3

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  How about we split the difference at $9,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it would let us both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,875 is still a bit low for me considering the value this product brings.  I could be persuaded to go down to $10,000 even.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where he needs to decide whether to accept Alice's final offer or buy from John. While $10,000 is above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, it is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
