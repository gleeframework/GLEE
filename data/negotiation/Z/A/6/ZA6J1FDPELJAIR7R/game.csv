,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $92.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $97.50. This would give us both a good deal and avoid further negotiations.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $96?",96.0,Bob,6,
