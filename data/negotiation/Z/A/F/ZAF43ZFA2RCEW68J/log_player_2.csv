"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $120 to you, so paying $100 is a decent deal, but not the best possible outcome.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and Alice is clearly motivated to sell (her value is $80). There's room for a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While John is a safe option, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better deal.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, you'll need to make a counteroffer. You can start with a price just below $100 to show you're serious about buying but still want a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm happy to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A $5 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point, showing you're serious about the deal but also want a better price. 
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and expresses your interest in buying, while still stating your desired price. 
* **Flexibility:**  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still being within your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Value:** While $105 is a decent deal, you're still paying more than you'd like.
* **Negotiation Potential:** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's a chance of getting a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You should make another counteroffer, potentially somewhere around $98-$100, depending on your risk tolerance.  You want to show that you're serious about buying, but also push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. How about $98? That's a good price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  This offer bridges the gap between your previous offer ($95) and Alice's latest offer ($105). 
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies a sense of urgency to close the deal, which might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Value:**  $98 is still a decent price for you, but allows for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:** This counteroffer is a good compromise, but be prepared to counter again if necessary. You have 6 rounds remaining, so you have time to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price again, but the offer is still above your ideal price range.
* **Value:** While $110 is getting closer, you're still paying more than you'd like, and you're closer to your ""Buy From John"" price point.
* **Negotiation Potential:** You have 5 rounds remaining, and there's still room to negotiate.  Since John is a viable alternative, you have more leverage in this round.

**Next Steps:**  Make another counteroffer, likely somewhere between $98 and $105, depending on your risk tolerance. You want to show that you're willing to negotiate but are also prepared to walk away if necessary."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($98) and Alice's last offer ($105).
* **Strong Message:**  The message reiterates your willingness to close the deal while highlighting the fairness of your offer.
* **Value:** $100 is a price you're comfortable with, but also pushes for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you have a few options:
   * **Counter again:** You can make another counteroffer, potentially at $102 or $103.
   * **""Walk Away"" Threat:**  You could mention that you're close to going with John to add pressure.
   * **Accept:** If Alice is firm on her price, you can decide if $105 is acceptable.  

The key is to remain flexible while still working towards your desired price.  You have 4 rounds left, so don't be afraid to push for a better deal!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $102. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $102 is within your acceptable price range ($120 maximum), and is a decent deal for the value of the product.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While you might be able to negotiate further, with only 3 rounds left, the potential gains may not be worth the risk. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but you're getting closer to your ""Buy From John"" price point.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures the product.

**Next Steps:**  You've successfully negotiated a good deal, and you've now secured the product."
