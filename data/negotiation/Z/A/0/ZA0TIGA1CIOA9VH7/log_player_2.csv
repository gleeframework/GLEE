"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible. Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, rejecting Alice's offer of $900,000 and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still higher than the price you can get from John.  It's better to secure the product for $800,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation and potentially a higher price from Alice."
