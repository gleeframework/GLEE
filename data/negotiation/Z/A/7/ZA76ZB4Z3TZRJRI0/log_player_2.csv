"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's something that I've valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000. This is a substantial deal, and I'm confident you'll see the incredible value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $1,250,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
