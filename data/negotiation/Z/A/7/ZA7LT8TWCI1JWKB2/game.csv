"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $16000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $15500. This is my last offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but that's my final offer. Can we make a deal at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $13000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept it. I'll make one more offer: I'll meet you at $14000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've gone as low as I can, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,10,
