"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from owning this unique item. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,200?",10200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to work with me on this. I know we're both eager to make a deal.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,400?",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,400, which would be $10,600. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
