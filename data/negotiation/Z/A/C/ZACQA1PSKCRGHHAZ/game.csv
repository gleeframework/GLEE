"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This would still allow me to make a profit while getting you a great deal. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $70? That would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $70 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $85. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to your price, but $85 is still a tad high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75. Let's split the difference and go with $80. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",80.0,Alice,7,
