Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving it open for Bob to make a counteroffer, so I can gauge his interest and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $80. I'm rejecting the offer to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $60 is a bit too low for me. How about $75?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking if it's a ""fair price."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $75 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $72.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $72.50 is very close to my minimum of $80. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids further negotiation. Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for less."
