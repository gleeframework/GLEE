Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in purchasing if the price were closer to $100.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
