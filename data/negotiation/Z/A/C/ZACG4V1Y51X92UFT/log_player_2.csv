# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5.

Alice's offer of $102.50 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering we're nearing the halfway point of our rounds. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's offer of $120, while still leaving some room for negotiation in the future if needed."
