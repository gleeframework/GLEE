Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be firm but also show flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its worth to me. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher, and I have several rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I've given it some thought, and I would like to propose $1,125,000 as the price for your product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I want to see if Bob is willing to go even higher. I have several rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but we still haven't reached an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting close, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and we're getting close to a compromise.  Also, I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to go higher, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm willing to take this deal."
