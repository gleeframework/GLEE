"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $18000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $22000. This is the lowest price I can consider at this point.",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $19000?",19000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $19000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19000 and $22000, which would be $20500. This is the best I can do at this point.",20500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $18500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18500 and $22000, which would be $20250. However, I'm also considering selling the product to John, who is willing to buy it for $10000, so I need to think about my next move carefully.",20250.0,Alice,7,
