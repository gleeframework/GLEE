"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000.  This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's very close to his target price of $1,200,000 and John is offering the product at that price. It's worth pushing Alice a little further to see if she'll drop her price even lower, but if she won't, he can just buy from John."
