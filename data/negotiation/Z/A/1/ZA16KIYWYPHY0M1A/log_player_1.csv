Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make him more receptive to a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
