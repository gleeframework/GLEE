"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as much value as possible.  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation. I also want to see if he's willing to pay a significant premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'll keep in mind that he values the product at $15,000, and I have room to go higher than his $12,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is still a good price for Bob since it's lower than his perceived value, but it's also significantly higher than what he offered.  This leaves room for negotiation if he's still interested, while still allowing me to earn more than I would by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my desired price, and I'm worried that if I reject it, he might not counter again or might offer an even lower price.  I'm also concerned that I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a profit of $1,000 now than risk losing more time and getting a lower offer."
