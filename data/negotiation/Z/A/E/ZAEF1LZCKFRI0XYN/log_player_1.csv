"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing my minimum is $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum price. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer at $12,500. It's a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get closer to $12,000 with continued negotiation, or if not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering my minimum price, hoping that Bob will finally agree. I'm confident that he values the product at $10,000, so this should be an acceptable offer for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get closer to my desired price.  While Bob's offer of $11,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
