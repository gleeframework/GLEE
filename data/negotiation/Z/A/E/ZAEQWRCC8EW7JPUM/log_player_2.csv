Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slight discount. I can offer you the product for $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget! $750,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you the product for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $825,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000 price."
