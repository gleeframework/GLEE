"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $8,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is too high for Bob. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

While $13,500 is closer to my budget than Alice's previous offers, I'm still willing to try for a lower price. I'll make one more counteroffer, and if Alice doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer."

Alice's final offer of $12,800 is still higher than my budget. While it's a good deal compared to her initial offer, it's important to stick to my maximum limit.  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within my budget and a better deal than what Alice is offering.  I'll buy the product from John."
