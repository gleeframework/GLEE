"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this. To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm proposing a final price of $1,000,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and presents a compelling opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. It's better to secure the product from John at a price that aligns with Bob's financial constraints."
