"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this revised price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is valuable, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this. To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm proposing a final price of $1,000,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and presents a compelling opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
