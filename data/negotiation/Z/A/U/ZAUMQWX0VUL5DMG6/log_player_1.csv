Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* It might pique Bob's interest and make him want to engage in the process.

I'm confident that I can get a good price for this product.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter-offer based on his response and try to reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, if the negotiations drag on or become too frustrating, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price.  

I will counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000.  This price is still well above Bob's initial offer, but it shows my willingness to compromise.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my desire to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred to sell for a higher price, I'm satisfied with this outcome. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
