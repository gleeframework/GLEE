This is a good time to accept Alice's offer for the following reasons:

* **Price is right:** $925,000 is a significant saving from her initial offer and a reasonable compromise.
* **""Final offer"" pressure:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic, signaling she might walk away from the deal.  
* **John's price:** While you could buy from John for $1,000,000, securing the product for $75,000 less is a significant win."
