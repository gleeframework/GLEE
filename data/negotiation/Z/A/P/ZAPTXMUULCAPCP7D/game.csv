"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more around $900,000. Would that work for you?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll be forced to explore other options, including selling to John. Let me know your decision.",925000.0,Alice,5,
