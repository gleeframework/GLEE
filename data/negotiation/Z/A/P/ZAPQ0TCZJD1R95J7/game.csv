"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think you'll really love it. As a special offer, I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a good profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $75. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $82. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $78. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $80. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",80.0,Alice,7,
