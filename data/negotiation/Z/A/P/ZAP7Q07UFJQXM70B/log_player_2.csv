"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's desired price, it's still too high for Bob's budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to secure the best deal possible, and his maximum budget is $800,000. He's starting the negotiation with his absolute limit, hoping Alice might be willing to compromise to avoid losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price even lower.  He can still buy from John for $800,000 if he has to, but there's still room to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his initial $800,000, showing that he's willing to compromise but is still aiming for a price closer to his budget. This is a strategic move to demonstrate his seriousness while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is only $50,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and leaving him to buy from John for $800,000 is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and still saves a significant amount of money."
