Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a good starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging tone can help create a more positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Plan B:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not pressured to accept a very low price.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $800,000, which is the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($600,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob that $800,000 is still a good deal for him considering the value he places on the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Backup Plan:**  As before, I'm aware of John's offer and not pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
