"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident it will be a major asset to your business. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it allows us both to walk away with a win.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm starting to think we might be too far apart on price. While I appreciate your persistence, $1250000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1325000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know your decision.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
