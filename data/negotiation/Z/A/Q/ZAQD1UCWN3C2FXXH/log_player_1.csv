Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and John's offer is always an option."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, I still think I can push for a slightly higher price. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price yet."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up a bit more, but I'll propose $1,225,000. I'm hoping we can get closer to a deal that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, $1,225,000 is still below my target price.  I have 4 rounds left, and I'm going to try to get a better offer from Bob before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This is a fair price that should allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  We're down to the last two rounds, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to go any higher. John's offer guarantees me my target price, and I'd rather secure that than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
