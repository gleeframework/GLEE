Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range that's very profitable for you.
* **Backup Offer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed $8,000 from John provides leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim high with Bob. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$10,000:**  While Bob values it at this, starting at his maximum leaves no room for him to feel like he got a deal. He's more likely to reject it outright.
* **$8,000:** This is your fallback price with John. Offering it to Bob leaves a lot of potential profit on the table."
