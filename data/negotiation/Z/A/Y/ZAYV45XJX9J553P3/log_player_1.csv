Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find the product valuable enough to consider a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
I'm hoping that by meeting Bob halfway again, he will see the value in the product and be willing to accept my offer. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm making a final counteroffer, hoping to meet Bob's price expectations while still getting a fair deal for myself.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time. I'm also not sure if Bob will be willing to go any higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
