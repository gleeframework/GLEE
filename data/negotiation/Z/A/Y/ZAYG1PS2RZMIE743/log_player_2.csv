"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity given your interest and the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $11,500. Alice values the product at $10,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise that allows for a fair transaction between us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering $11,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $10,500.
* **Value to Bob:** Bob's maximum value for the product is $12,000. 
* **John's Price:**  John is selling the product for $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer and potentially raising her price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice for Bob. It gets him the product for a price lower than John's and is within his budget. The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings of $500."
