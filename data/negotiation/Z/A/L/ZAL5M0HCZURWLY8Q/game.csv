"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you recognizing the inherent value of this product. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while acknowledging the product's worth.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I need the price to come down a bit more to make this work for me. I can do $1,650,000.  That's a substantial investment on my end and shows how much I value acquiring this product.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
