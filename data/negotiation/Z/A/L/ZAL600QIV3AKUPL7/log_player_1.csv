Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so this price gives him room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $15,000, so this leaves space for you to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is straightforward and invites Bob to respond.

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a negotiation that is likely to be successful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and far lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than your minimum, but it's getting closer.  The negotiations are moving in the right direction. At this point, accepting Bob's offer is a good option. It's a quick and relatively easy sale,  even if it's not the ideal price. It's better than rejecting his offer and risking that the negotiation stalls or breaks down, or going with John and leaving the potential for a better deal with Bob on the table."
