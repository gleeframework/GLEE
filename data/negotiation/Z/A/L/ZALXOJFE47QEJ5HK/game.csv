"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to counter with an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $11000, as I think the product is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we try $11250? I think this is a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,5,
