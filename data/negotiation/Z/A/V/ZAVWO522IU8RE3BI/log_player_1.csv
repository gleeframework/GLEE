"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $750,000 gap allows for some back and forth before reaching a potential agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm reducing my initial offer but staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Fairness:** Emphasize that the new price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving a small gap for further negotiations, signaling that I'm open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is unchanged:**  He's stuck at his initial $1,200,000 offer, which is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **More negotiation rounds:** I have 6 rounds left. I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is still available:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and the closest I can go at this time. Consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm signaling that this is a more serious offer by stating it's my ""final offer.""
* **Meeting halfway:** While I'm still above my minimum, I'm making a substantial compromise to show I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Finality:** This creates pressure on Bob to respond and prevents further rounds of him offering the same low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  I've only got 4 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is too low:** He's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John is offering $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and meets my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending the negotiation without a deal, leaving me with nothing. Selling to John ensures a profit and removes the uncertainty."
