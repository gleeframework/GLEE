"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,100,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer you $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is still a better price than John's offer of $1,200,000.  While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer, and you'll be stuck with John's higher price.  It's a good deal at this point."
