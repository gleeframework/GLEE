Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Create a Sense of Value:** Highlighting the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""benefits"" reinforces its value in Bob's mind, making the price more palatable.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if needed."
