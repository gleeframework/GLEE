Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $12,000 (because you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer).
* **Bob's Value:** $10,000 
* **Potential Profit Zone:**  Between $10,000 and $12,000

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (so he doesn't reject it) but also gets you closer to your $12,000 minimum.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps things positive and focuses on value for Bob.
* **The Price:**  This price splits the difference between Bob's perceived value and your minimum, leaving room for you to potentially negotiate down slightly if needed.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit higher than $11,500.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important,  a more generous offer might be appropriate."
