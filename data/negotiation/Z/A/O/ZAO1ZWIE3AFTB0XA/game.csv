"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still gives me a reasonable profit. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit high for me. How about $100?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
