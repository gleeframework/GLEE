{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is the highest possible price I can offer initially.  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $80, so he likely won't accept this offer.  This sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still gives me a reasonable profit. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit high for me. How about $100?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get a better price, or at least, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
