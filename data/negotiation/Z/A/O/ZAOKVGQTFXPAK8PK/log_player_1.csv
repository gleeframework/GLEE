# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my preferred outcome. I'm not desperate for a quick sale. It's worth seeing if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.  I believe I can get a better deal than $12,500."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer and coming down to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing this sale.  It's better to accept the offer than to risk a long negotiation process that might not result in a higher price."
