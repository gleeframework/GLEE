"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering I can get it for $1,000,000 elsewhere. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
