# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is too high for him, and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his limit. He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, making it more worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John."
