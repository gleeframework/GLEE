"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth much more to you than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective values for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's true value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
