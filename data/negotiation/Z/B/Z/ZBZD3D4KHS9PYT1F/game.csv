"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's start with $850,000 and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my target price.  While $875,000 is a good start, I'm still a bit over budget.  Let's try $860,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about being over budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $870,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
