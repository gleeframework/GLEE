Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about being over budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $870,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating hard and is close to his target price, but Alice is still unwilling to budge significantly.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and then having to pay John's price is too high. 

He decides to buy the product from John for $800,000.  It's the most financially secure option and meets his budget."
