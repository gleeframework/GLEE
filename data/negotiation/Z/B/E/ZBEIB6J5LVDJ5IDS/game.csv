"Thanks for the offer Alice! While I think the product is great, $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
