Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,000.  This is a reasonable starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept given that I'm still making a profit, $9,500 is significantly less than my initial offer of $11,000. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that we can agree on."

Bob is clearly not willing to come up to a price that makes this negotiation worthwhile for me. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him and potentially losing the sale entirely. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe bet."
