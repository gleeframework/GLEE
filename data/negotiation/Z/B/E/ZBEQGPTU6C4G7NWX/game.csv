"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price you're asking is quite high. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $500,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident it will yield returns far exceeding that for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its unique value proposition.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I agree the product has potential, $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value it offers while acknowledging your desire for a more agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but the product's value justifies a higher price. My final offer is $950,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential returns you'll see.",950000.0,Alice,7,
