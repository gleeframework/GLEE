Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a good starting point:** It's higher than your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation open. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum price. While you'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
