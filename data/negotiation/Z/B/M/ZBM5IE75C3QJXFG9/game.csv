"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm looking at something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
