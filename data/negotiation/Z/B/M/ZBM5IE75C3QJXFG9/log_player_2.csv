Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.
