"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident it's an investment that will pay for itself quickly. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it's a price that allows me to get a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
