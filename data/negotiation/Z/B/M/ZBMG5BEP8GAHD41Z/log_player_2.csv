"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and features, it's worth $120 to me, but considering your needs and expectations, I'm willing to negotiate. Would you be interested in purchasing this product for $110? This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($110) is still higher than your maximum price ($100).** 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or simply proceed with your backup plan and buy from John."
