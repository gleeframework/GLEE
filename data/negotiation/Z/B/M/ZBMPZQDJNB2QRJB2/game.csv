"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original price and your offer. Would you consider $100 for the product?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $95, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this great product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay a bit more than $80, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $97? It's a bit above $92, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",97.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to go up to $96, which is just a bit more than your last offer. What do you think?",96.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $96. I'll meet you at $95, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to sell at that price, I'll make the deal.",95.0,Bob,10,
