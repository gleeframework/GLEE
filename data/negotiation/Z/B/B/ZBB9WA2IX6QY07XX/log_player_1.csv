This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm also considering Bob's value of $8,000 to create a starting point that might be attractive to him.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit.  $10,000 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the sale to John is increasing.  It's better to accept Bob's offer now and secure a sale."
