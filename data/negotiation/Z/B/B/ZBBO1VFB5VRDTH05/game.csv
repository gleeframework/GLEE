"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who values the product as much as I do.",8500.0,Bob,4,
