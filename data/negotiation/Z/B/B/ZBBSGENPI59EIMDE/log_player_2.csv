"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000, so there is room for negotiation. A counteroffer will allow you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a fairly aggressive price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within your budget and a better price than what John is offering. It's a good deal, so you should accept the offer."
