"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to meet my minimum requirements. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
