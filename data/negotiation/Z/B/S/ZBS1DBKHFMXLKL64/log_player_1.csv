Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob the full price that I value the product at. This is a high price, but it sets the stage for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, I'm confident that John will purchase it from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $900,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I need to get, and I've already lowered my price significantly. It's time to move on. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's the best deal for me at this point."
