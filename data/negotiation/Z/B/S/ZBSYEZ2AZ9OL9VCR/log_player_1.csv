"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $800,000, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and this strategy allows me to gauge his interest while leaving room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I have nine rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more reasonable compromise than my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, but I want to show Bob that I'm serious about selling the product and I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit for me, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he might not be willing to negotiate further. With only six rounds left, it's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing the sale altogether."
