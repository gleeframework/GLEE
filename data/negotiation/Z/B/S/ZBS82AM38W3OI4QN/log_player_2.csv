"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below her valuation, it's still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at the lower price of $1,200,000, saving yourself $100,000."
