"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. I understand its value to you is higher, but I am looking to keep my expenses within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,750. This price still allows you to stay within your budget, and it's closer to the value of the product for me.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,
