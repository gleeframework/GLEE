"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's worth significantly more to you, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price and lower than your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $8,000 value.  You can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if needed."
