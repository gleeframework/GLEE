"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
