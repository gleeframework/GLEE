"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $150 to you.
* Alice is offering it for $120.
* You can get it from John for $150. 

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product from John for $150, which is still within your budget and a better deal than accepting Alice's offer."
