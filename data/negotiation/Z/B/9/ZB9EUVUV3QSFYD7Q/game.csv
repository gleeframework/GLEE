"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Given its value to you, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price allows for a healthy profit for you and is within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This price reflects the product's value to you and allows for a good profit. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
