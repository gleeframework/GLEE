"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and Alice's initial offer is $1,300,000, which leaves considerable room for negotiation. There's a significant difference between Alice's worth and her offer, suggesting the possibility of a much lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. Given its value to you, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price allows for a healthy profit for you and is within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle a bit? I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice is still willing to sell for more than the product is worth to her, indicating that there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows for another counteroffer to potentially reach a lower price."
