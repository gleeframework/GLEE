Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 to match your alternative offer from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. This price point is also likely to be appealing to Bob, as it's considerably less than his maximum valuation. 

By starting at $100, you leave yourself open to potentially earning even more if Bob is willing to negotiate higher."
