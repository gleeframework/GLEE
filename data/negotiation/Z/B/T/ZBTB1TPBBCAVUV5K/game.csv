"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. This is a fair price for a product of this quality.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm the only buyer interested.",8000.0,Bob,4,
