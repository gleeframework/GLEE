"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,000. This is a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm the only buyer interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is clearly fixated on his $8,000 valuation and isn't budging. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than continuing with Bob."
