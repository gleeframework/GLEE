"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price? If not, I will proceed to look for the product elsewhere.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1250000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction in price. However, considering my budget, I am still unable to meet the $1250000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1100000. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of the product and my financial capacity. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While your offer is getting closer to what I need, $1100000 is still just a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. I am willing to consider your latest proposal, but I must reiterate my budgetary constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $1125000. This price reflects a compromise that respects the value of the product while aligning with my financial situation. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
