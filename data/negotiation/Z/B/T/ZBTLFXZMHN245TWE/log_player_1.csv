I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."

I'm counteroffering with $1,800,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be closer to his acceptable range and we can come to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned we won't reach an agreement that benefits me.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get a fair price and avoid further negotiation."
