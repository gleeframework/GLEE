(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer to show my serious intent to buy but at a price that's still within my acceptable range."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still staying within my budget. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come down further in price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is at my maximum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. John is offering the same price, so it's better to secure the product now and avoid any potential delays or complications."
