"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value of this product to me. I can offer you a price of $980,000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still below my minimum. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
