"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground we can both agree on."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to $12,000. I'm not ready to sell to John for $10,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11,750}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,750. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still hoping for a price closer to my desired amount. I'm nearing my minimum value and want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's better than selling to John for $10,000 and leaves me with just enough time to counteroffer if Bob refuses to budge on price in the final two rounds."
