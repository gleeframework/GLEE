# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

We've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is getting very close to your minimum acceptable price. However, there's still a risk that you won't be able to secure a better price. Given the number of rounds remaining, the potential for further negotiation is limited. It's a safer choice to sell to John, as you are guaranteed to receive your minimum desired price."
