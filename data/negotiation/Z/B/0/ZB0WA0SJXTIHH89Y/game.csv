"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is still a significant discount from the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $925000 for the product.

We believe this offer strikes a balance between fairness and our business interests.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $912500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",912500.0,Bob,4,
