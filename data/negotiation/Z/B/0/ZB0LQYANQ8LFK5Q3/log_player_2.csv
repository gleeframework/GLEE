"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This item holds immense value to me and represents years of dedication and innovation. I understand its worth to you stands at $1,200,000, which is significantly more than its intrinsic value to me. Considering this, I propose to offer it to you for $950,000. This price reflects my commitment to ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction while also allowing me to maintain a fair return on my investment. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of creating a mutually beneficial relationship. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000) and your alternative option with John ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation here. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
