"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $850,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my minimum and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Concession:** By coming down to $1,000,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strong Position:** I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing the value of the product.  
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, I need to keep John's offer in mind as a potential alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's make a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price, which indicates a willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a significant difference from my target. I'll continue negotiating strategically to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? This would be my final offer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to go any lower. 
* **Midpoint:**  This price point represents a significant compromise from my initial ask but is still a considerable profit above Bob's initial offer.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers increases. This offer aims for a decisive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** While not ideal, $925,000 is a substantial sum and only slightly below my final offer. It represents a successful negotiation from both our starting points.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to push Bob risks losing him as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer secures a very good deal, even if it's not the absolute maximum I could have gotten.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now allows me to move forward. The additional potential profit from continuing negotiations isn't worth the risk and time investment at this point."
