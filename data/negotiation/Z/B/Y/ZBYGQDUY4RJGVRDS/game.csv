"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? This would be my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're almost there.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
