"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will give me an initial indication of Bob's interest and negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $150. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still have several rounds remaining and can likely get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  It's good to keep John in mind as a backup, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $107.50?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing this as a win-win scenario, emphasizing that it's a fair deal for both of us.
* **Strategic Price:** $107.50 is a good compromise that's closer to my desired price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $107.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Threshold:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $150 I need to make a profit.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There are still several rounds left, and I can likely get a higher price.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  John is a good backup, but I'm not ready to sell to him yet. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet halfway again. I'm offering the product for $101.87.  This is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 101.87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm showing that I'm persistent and still interested in a deal with Bob. 
* **Midpoint Again:** I'm again offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. This might help him see it as a good investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $101.87 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $96.25.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **More Rounds Left:**  I have four rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly below what I need.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's try to bridge the gap a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $99.06. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal for the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 99.06}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, but it's still above Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm not ready to accept a low price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm reiterating that this is a compromise and a fair deal. 
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the value of the product to help justify the price. 

I'm hoping this smaller move will entice Bob to come up slightly, or at least lead to a more agreeable counteroffer."
