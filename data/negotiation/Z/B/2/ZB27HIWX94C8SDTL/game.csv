"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $107.50?  That way we both get a fair deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $107.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $96.25?  It's a fair price for both of us.",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet halfway again. I'm offering the product for $101.87.  This is a fair price considering its value.",101.87,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $101.87 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $96.25.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",96.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. Let's try to bridge the gap a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $99.06. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal for the value of the product.",99.06,Alice,7,
