"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $650,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  The product looks promising, but $650,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $650,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $575,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",575000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. While $575,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $540,000?",540000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $575,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $540,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $555,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement.",555000.0,Alice,5,
