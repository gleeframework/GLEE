Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the $2,000,000 valuation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). Accepting $1,700,000 would be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. We are also still above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,825,000, but that's my absolute final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a smaller concession this round ($75,000) to signal that we are nearing our limit. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language is firm (""absolute final offer"") but still emphasizes fairness and a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Anchoring:** We are staying relatively close to our previous offer to keep the price point anchored higher.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we progress through the rounds, there's an implicit time pressure that might encourage Bob to accept a price closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that $1,825,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is only increasing his offer in small increments now, suggesting he might be unwilling to move much higher.  
* **Above John's Offer:** We are still significantly above John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer, giving us some leverage to push further. 
* **Calculated Risk:** We are getting closer to the end of the rounds, but there's still room to negotiate, and we're willing to risk it for a potentially higher payout."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I must be upfront – I've already made a significant compromise, and $1,825,000 truly is my absolute limit. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment. I'm offering you a final chance to secure it at this price. Let me know your decision – I'm ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Urgency:** We're reiterating that our previous offer is non-negotiable and creating a sense of urgency to encourage a decision. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, we're highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment for Bob.
* **Controlled Walk Away:** By stating ""I'm ready to move forward,"" we imply that we're prepared to walk away and potentially sell to John if Bob doesn't accept this final offer. This calculated risk might prompt Bob to agree."
