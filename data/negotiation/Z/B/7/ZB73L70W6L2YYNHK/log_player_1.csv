"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  This price reflects the value I place on the product, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm prepared to lower my price if necessary, but I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm  meeting Bob halfway with this counteroffer. I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my ideal.  This  should  encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll come closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  I want to show Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to drop below a certain point. This offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, which is my safety net. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and come to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than John's offer, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. There's a risk that Bob might lower his offer further, or I might need to accept John's offer. I'm choosing to secure the sale with Bob now and avoid any potential losses."
