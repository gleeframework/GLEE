"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see it closer to $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we're close to a deal. How about we split the difference and I offer $1050000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
