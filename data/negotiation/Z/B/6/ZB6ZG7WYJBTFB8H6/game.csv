"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",7000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $7,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $6,750 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $6,750 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $6,900. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you.",6900.0,Alice,5,
