``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While John is selling for $1,200,000, Alice is offering the product for $1,150,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:** Your maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
