"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $950,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposition of $850,000 for the product. This price aims to find a balance between the value I see in the product and your budget constraints.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for both of us, considering the value I see in the product and the fact that I'm willing to purchase it immediately.  I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
