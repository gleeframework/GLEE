Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to keep in mind:

* **John's offer:**  John is your safety net. This means you shouldn't accept any offer lower than $1,500,000. 
* **Bob's perspective:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so you need to be persuasive to get him to pay more.
* **Negotiation strategy:** You can use John's offer as leverage during negotiation.  If Bob makes a counteroffer that is too low, you can threaten to sell to John.

Let me know how the negotiation goes and I can help you with your next moves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's above John's offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. 

Here's why rejecting is the best move:

* **Leverage:** You can use John's offer as leverage.  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer and threaten to sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product. You might be able to convince him to pay closer to your initial offer. 

Let's counteroffer and see what happens. I'll help you craft a compelling counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to be closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, especially considering the product's worth.  If we can't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,600,000?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strong:

* **Compromise:** You're showing willingness to compromise by coming down from your initial offer.
* **Leverage:**  You're subtly reminding Bob of John's offer, putting pressure on him to agree.
* **Reasonable price:** The counteroffer is still above your minimum but leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal! Bob's offer is just $50,000 above John's offer.  Accepting this offer means:

* **Profit:**  You'll make a good profit on the product.
* **Efficiency:**  You'll avoid further negotiation and potentially having to deal with John.

While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving you with John's offer, which is the same amount.  

It's always a good idea to weigh the potential gain against the potential loss. In this case, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
