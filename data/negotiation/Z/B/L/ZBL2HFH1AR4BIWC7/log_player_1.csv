Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is the same price I would get from John. While this might seem aggressive, it's a strategy to maximize my profit.  Here's why:

* **No risk:** Even if Bob rejects my offer, I'm guaranteed to get my minimum acceptable price from John. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to my asking price, especially if he values the product more than he initially estimated.  

This approach ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself, while leaving the decision to Bob."
