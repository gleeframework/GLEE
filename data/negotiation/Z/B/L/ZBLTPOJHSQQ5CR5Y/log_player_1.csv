Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling for less than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left a significant gap between your offer and Bob's potential value ($1,500,000), allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not too aggressive, but it also shows you're not desperate to sell.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to him and leaves less room for negotiation in future rounds.  

It's better to reject his offer and send a counteroffer that is still higher than your minimum but lower than your initial offer. This will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than your minimum:** You're still aiming for more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Counteroffer is lower than your previous offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message is friendly and encouraging:**  You acknowledge Bob's offer, but frame it as a starting point for finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good deal considering:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum selling price of $1,200,000.
* **It's a fair compromise:**  You've already made some concessions, and Bob has shown his willingness to negotiate. 
* **The risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer, and the longer you negotiate, the higher the chance of John buying the product for the same price.

Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
