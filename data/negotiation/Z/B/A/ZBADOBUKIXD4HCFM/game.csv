"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. That price is quite high for me, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 for this product. Would that be possible?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However,  $1,900,000 is still far above my budget. Could you consider something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, but we still have a way to go. This product has the potential to be a real game-changer for you, and I wouldn't want you to miss out. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
