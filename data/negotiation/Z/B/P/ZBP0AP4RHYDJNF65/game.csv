"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a considerable sum.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement as we discuss further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $1,800,000 undervalues the product's unique potential. This isn't just a standard item; it offers significant long-term value.  To find a middle ground, I propose $2,000,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
