"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can offer you a price of $13,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $12,500? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks again for working with me on this.  $13,000 is very close, but I'm trying to stay closer to $12,500. Would you consider meeting me at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I can offer you a price of $13,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500.",13250.0,Alice,9,
