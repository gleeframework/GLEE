"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $12,500 is still below my minimum, and I have 8 more rounds to get closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. I have 6 more rounds to work with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference again. How about $13,125?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together."", ""product_price"": 13125}
