"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference again. How about $13,125?  I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",13125.0,Alice,5,
