"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
