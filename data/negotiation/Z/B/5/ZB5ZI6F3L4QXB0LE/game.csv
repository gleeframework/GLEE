"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm happy to negotiate, $11000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This still gives you a great deal on a truly valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
