"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate while still making a decent profit. It's important to start strong and gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's much lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $60."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $120 to make this work. Let's split the difference. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to what I consider reasonable. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage further negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not eager to let it go for $60, and $120 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle around $80? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is closer to what I'm willing to accept, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have plenty of rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to compromise further, how about $100? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'm also framing it as a win-win situation to encourage him to accept. I still have 5 rounds left and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $90.  Do you think we could make that work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and hope to get closer to my minimum value. I have 4 rounds left and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still trying to get as close to my minimum value as possible. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.  We only have 3 rounds left, so I need to make a decisive move."
