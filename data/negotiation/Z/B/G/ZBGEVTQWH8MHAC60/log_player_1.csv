Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be highly valuable to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my earnings.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's potential value to Bob's business to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which can prevent Bob from immediately rejecting the offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget allows me to pay up to $950000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my target:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below the value I've assigned to the product ($800,000).
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He clearly sees value in the product and might be willing to pay more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John is safe, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to try and get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial ask. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counteroffering at a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to his business to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation (But Firm):** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation but showing that I'm not willing to drop much further. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward to avoid getting stuck and potentially losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to go up to $960000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $800,000.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation might take time, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my full target price, a successful transaction with Bob might lead to future opportunities with him. 

While I'm not getting the full price I hoped for, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision in this situation."
