Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and makes any subsequent offer seem more appealing. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly emphasizes the product's worth, even if Bob doesn't value it as much as you do.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone is open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving you in a strong negotiating position."
