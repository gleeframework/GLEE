**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your desired maximum.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1150000. This would give us both a good deal, and I believe the value of this product justifies this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above your desired maximum of $1,000,000.  You have room to negotiate further, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially achieve a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $1100000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value of this product in the long run. Let's close this deal!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still above your maximum of $1,000,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, you're not guaranteed to get a lower price from Alice.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you the product at your desired price point, saving you time and effort in the negotiation process."
