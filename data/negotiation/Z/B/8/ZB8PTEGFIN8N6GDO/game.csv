"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to spend no more than $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000? This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident this product is worth the investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1150000. This would give us both a good deal, and I believe the value of this product justifies this price. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which would be a good compromise.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $1100000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1125000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value of this product in the long run. Let's close this deal!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
