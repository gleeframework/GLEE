Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as that's below my minimum price. I believe the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm still not comfortable with dropping below $12,000. I'll counteroffer Bob again, but I'm also considering selling to John if the deal with Bob falls through."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay that amount and finalize the deal.

Bob is sticking to $11,000, and I'm not willing to drop below $11,500. It seems we're at an impasse. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000, I'll sell to him instead."
