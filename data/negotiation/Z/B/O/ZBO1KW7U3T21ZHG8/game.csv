"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $5000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $6000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $20000. This is the last price I can offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",20000.0,Alice,5,
