"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable range.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a reliable alternative. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,025,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $990,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still too far below my minimum price, even with his latest offer.  While I could accept $990,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer one last time in the next round and if he doesn't come up, I'll sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be as flexible as possible, but $990,000 is simply too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you one last time at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
