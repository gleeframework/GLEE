"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering. He knows he can buy the product for $8,000 from John, so he has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we settle on $10,250? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. At this point, Alice has shown she's not willing to go much lower than $10,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price from Alice.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is the best deal Bob can get."
