"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  It's a great product, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $165. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $140?  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, $140 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $155. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a great deal for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
