"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to your business. My initial offer is $1000000. This leaves room for negotiation, and I'm eager to find a price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a significant discount from your initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you than that, and I'm confident it can generate a strong return on your investment.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950000?  This is a fair price that acknowledges both our positions.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $925000? This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
