,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $125?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still think the product is worth more than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and my original offer of $150. How about we try $137.50? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
