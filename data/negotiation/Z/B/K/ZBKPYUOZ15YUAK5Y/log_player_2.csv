"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob can try to negotiate further or go with John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice has come down to $9,500, which is still higher than Bob's target price.  While continuing to negotiate with Alice might potentially lead to a lower price, there's no guarantee.  John's offer is a sure thing at the price Bob is aiming for."
