Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's start with this figure and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
