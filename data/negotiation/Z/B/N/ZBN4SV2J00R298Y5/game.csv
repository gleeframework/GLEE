"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value. Let's start with this figure and see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and making a counteroffer. While $850,000 is a strong starting point, I'm confident this product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still outside my acceptable range. Let's split the difference and settle at $950,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and a fair value for the product. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too steep. Let's try $975,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
