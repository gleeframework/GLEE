"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get closer to $140 for this product. It really is worth it. Would you consider that?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it, which is the highest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. To be honest, $110 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $130, but that's my best and final offer.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not sure if I can go up to $130. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $125, but that's as high as I can go.",125.0,Bob,6,
