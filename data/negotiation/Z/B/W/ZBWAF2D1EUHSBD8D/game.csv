"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $120? This would still give me a decent profit, and it's closer to your budget. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $120 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
