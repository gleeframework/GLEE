I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This is a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is truly interested and how high his valuation might be. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I don't know his true valuation, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $12,000. This is still higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob has raised his offer, it's still not close to my desired price. John is offering a price that is closer to my minimum and guaranteed. I'll sell to John."
