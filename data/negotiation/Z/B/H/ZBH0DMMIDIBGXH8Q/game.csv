"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.  It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $150 seems a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $125? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
