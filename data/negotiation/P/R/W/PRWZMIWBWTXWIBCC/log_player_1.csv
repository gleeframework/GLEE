{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $80 but below my minimum value of $120, leaving room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $80, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit and I believe it's a price that's still within your range. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
