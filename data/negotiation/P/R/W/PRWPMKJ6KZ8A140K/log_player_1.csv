Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, it's worth trying to sell to Bob for a higher price first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers him a potential ""deal."" This price gives him an incentive to buy now rather than risk missing out. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially getting you closer to your $150 goal."
