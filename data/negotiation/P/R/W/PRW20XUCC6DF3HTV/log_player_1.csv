"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving space for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as it matches John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, as he still has a significant profit margin at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher amount.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm trying to find a middle ground while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting closer to a deal.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and secures a good profit. I'm also concerned that if I keep rejecting, Bob might walk away completely, and I risk having to sell to John for a lower profit."
