"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However,  $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $700,000?  I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still quite a ways off from that number.  To be honest, anything much above $800,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere near that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $800,000 is less than my ideal price, it's the closest we've come to a deal.  Continuing to negotiate might push him away, and I risk losing both his offer and the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Accepting his offer now secures a reasonable profit."
