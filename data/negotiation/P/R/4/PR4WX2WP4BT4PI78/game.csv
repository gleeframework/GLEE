"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However,  $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $700,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our negotiation so far. However,  $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still quite a ways off from that number.  To be honest, anything much above $800,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere near that?",800000.0,Bob,6,
