# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. While Alice's offer is only $1 more than John's, it's still over your budget.  You can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
