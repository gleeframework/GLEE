Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that amount, but I think it's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the true value of the product."

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."

Bob's offer is still too low, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with.  It's time to secure the sale with John for $1,500,000."
