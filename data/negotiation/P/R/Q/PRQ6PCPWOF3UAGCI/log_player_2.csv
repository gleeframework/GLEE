"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My research indicates that it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential benefits. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's eager to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
