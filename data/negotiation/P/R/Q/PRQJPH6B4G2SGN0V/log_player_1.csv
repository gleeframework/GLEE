Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that you value the product and are not willing to give it away cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to your minimum price, and it's likely he won't go lower. It's better to secure a sale at $90 than risk going back and forth and potentially ending up with John's offer of $80."
