"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is better than John's offer of $150, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it!  However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $125 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. It's a small increase from your proposal, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $132 is slightly higher than my ideal price of $125, but it's still a better deal than buying from John for $150.  It seems like Alice is firm on her price, so I'm willing to accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
