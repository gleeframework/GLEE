"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I understand the value of this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit and provides me with a significant value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant offer, but I was hoping to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product while still respecting my budget. Let's aim for a final deal on this number.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a bit above your last offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
