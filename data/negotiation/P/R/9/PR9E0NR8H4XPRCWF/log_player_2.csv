Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to $900,000."

Alice's offer:

I believe this price reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the agreement at this price.

Alice's offer of $980,000 is only slightly above my counter-offer of $950,000. It's a good deal for me, and while I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. It's worth it to accept her offer and avoid going back and forth further."
