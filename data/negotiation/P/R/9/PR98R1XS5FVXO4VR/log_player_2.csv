"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, getting you closer to your $150 maximum budget."
