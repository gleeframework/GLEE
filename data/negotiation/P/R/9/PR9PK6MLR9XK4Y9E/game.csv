"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10,000. Let me know if this is something you can consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $10,500?  That gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,200 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while providing a fair price for you. Looking forward to your response.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,200 is still too far below what I need to sell.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,350? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product is worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",10350.0,Alice,5,

"I see that we're getting closer to a mutual agreement, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $10,300 for the product. This still keeps me within my budget while offering you a reasonable profit. I hope this proposal works for you.",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10,325.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great value for the product.  Let's close this deal now.",10325.0,Alice,7,
