"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** A high starting price gives you the flexibility to make concessions throughout the negotiation without going below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge how interested Bob is and provide insight into his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is significantly above his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting his offer would be a loss compared to selling to John ($1,200,000).
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By rejecting and countering, you maintain control of the negotiation and can gradually guide the price closer to a favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential, $1,500,000 is still below its true market value. I could consider letting it go for $1,650,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate but still aims high. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""true market value"" reinforces the product's worth and justifies the higher price.
* **Pressure without Ultimatum:**  While emphasizing a ""significant reduction,"" there's no mention of walking away yet, keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob's engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:**  Bob's offer is inching closer to your minimum, but it's crucial to remember he values the product significantly lower. There's likely more room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation Tactics:**  Bob is using a common tactic of ""meeting halfway,"" even though his initial offers were skewed towards his desired range. 
* **Alternative Exists:** You still have the safety net of John's offer, allowing you to confidently push for a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, $1,550,000 still undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I have other interested buyers. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is your ""final offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency and limit further back-and-forth. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" (even if indirect) reinforces demand and provides a reason for the firm stance.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit above your minimum and still considerably more than Bob's initial offers, putting you in a strong position for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'll offer $1,575,000 for the product. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** You've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offers. $1,575,000 is a significant profit, exceeding your minimum by $375,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal to John's standing offer increases with each round.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows you to reinvest the proceeds sooner, potentially generating additional returns."
