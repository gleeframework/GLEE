"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential, $1,500,000 is still below its true market value. I could consider letting it go for $1,650,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal happen.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the product's value and potential.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, $1,550,000 still undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, as I have other interested buyers. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I'll offer $1,575,000 for the product. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
