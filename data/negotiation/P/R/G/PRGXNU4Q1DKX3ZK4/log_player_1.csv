"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $100. It's worth a lot more to you, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping he'll be motivated to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. $85 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping for a little bit more. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $85.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum price of $80 and still significantly lower than the $120 value of the product to Bob. Accepting this offer will maximize my profit in this negotiation."
