This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** She's explicitly stated this is her final offer and she won't go any lower.
* **You're getting a good deal:**  You're buying the product for $2,000 less than John's offer and Alice is selling at her own value.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:**  Continuing might just frustrate Alice and jeopardize the deal."
