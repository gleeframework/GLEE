"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also considering that he might be willing to pay more than $12,000, given that he's engaging in a negotiation. However, if he rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product. If he rejects this, I'll need to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I also still have a safety net with John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm flexible and willing to compromise, but it's still a fair price for me.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a better offer in the next round. If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better offer.  I'm confident that I can get closer to $12,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm also still protected by John's offer, so I don't feel pressured to accept anything less than what I believe is fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $10,500. This shows him that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and with only three rounds left, I need to start closing the deal. If he rejects, I'll probably accept John's offer next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offers are still not close to my minimum. I'm going to sell to John.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's more important to secure a sale and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer in the final rounds."
