"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget is capped at $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, but that's my final offer. This product is truly worth more than that, and I'm only offering this price because I value your business. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Negotiate further:**  This risks going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a price higher than $10,000, especially since Alice has already stated this is her ""final offer.""
* **Buy from John:**  This is the safest option. Bob knows he can buy the product for $10,000 from John, guaranteeing he stays within his budget. 

Since minimizing costs is Bob's priority,  buying from John provides the most certain outcome and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
