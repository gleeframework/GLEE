"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the potential value of the product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a little more than I'm able to spend. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's aim for $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget. This would allow me to acquire the product while still remaining within my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
