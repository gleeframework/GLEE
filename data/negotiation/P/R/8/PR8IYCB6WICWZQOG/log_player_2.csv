"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair and competitive offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're looking to spend no more than $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's room for negotiation since Alice is willing to sell for less than her value ($1,200,000).
* **Option to buy from John:**  You have a guaranteed alternative, so you don't have to accept an unfavorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the potential value of the product to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  You're aiming for $1,000,000 or less, and Alice's counteroffer is above that.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate further, which suggests there's still room to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John:**  You have a guaranteed alternative, so you're not pressured to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a little more than I'm able to spend. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's aim for $1,000,000, which is my maximum budget. This would allow me to acquire the product while still remaining within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  You're aiming for $1,000,000 or less, and Alice's offer is $50,000 above that.
* **No guarantee of reaching an agreement:**  While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, there's no guarantee that she'll come down to your price, especially since her counteroffers have been fairly close to her minimum.
* **Guaranteed alternative:**  You have a guaranteed alternative with John, allowing you to acquire the product at your target price.  You've already spent a few rounds trying to negotiate with Alice, and it's starting to become riskier to continue. 

It's better to secure the product at your target price with John than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
