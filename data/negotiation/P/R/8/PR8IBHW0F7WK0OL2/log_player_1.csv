Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize my profit, so I want to get as close to Bob's value of $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $800,000 from John. 
* **Offer:**  Offering $1,000,000 allows for a significant profit while still being appealing to Bob. It's a good middle ground that balances maximizing my earnings with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
