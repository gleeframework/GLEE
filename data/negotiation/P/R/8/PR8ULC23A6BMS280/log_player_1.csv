Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 just doesn't work for me. How about $130? This is still a great deal for such a unique product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to accept it and avoid further negotiation."
