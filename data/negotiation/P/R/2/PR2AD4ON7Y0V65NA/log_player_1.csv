Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product holds, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.
