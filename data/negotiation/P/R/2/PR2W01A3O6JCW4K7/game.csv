"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit low for me considering the value this product brings.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that be feasible?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
