Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay the full value. It's a bold opening offer that will give me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,650,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him while still securing a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal. I'm also mindful that I have a backup option with John, who's willing to pay the same amount.  Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer and securing the sale."
