"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate further.  He's still within his budget and might be able to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to negotiate down to his preferred price, but Alice has shown a strong resistance to going below $10,500. At this point, Bob has a few rounds left, but it seems unlikely he'll be able to convince Alice to sell for his target price.  He's better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000."
