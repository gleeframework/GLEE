"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also leaving some space for potential counteroffers while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but still gives me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more, $135 is still a good profit and the negotiation has been going on for a few rounds now.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers and there's always the chance that Bob will walk away."
