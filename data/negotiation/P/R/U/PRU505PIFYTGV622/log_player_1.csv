Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate. This also allows for the possibility of a counteroffer from Bob, which will give you more information about his willingness to pay.  Remember, I have John as a backup buyer, so I am not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $775,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $762,500. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $762,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $762,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $762,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  Given that Bob is unwilling to budge much further, and John is ready to pay $800,000, it's more advantageous to sell to John. I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John guarantees a higher return than accepting Bob's offer."
