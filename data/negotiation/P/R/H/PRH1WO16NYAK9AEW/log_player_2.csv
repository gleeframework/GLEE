"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a better price.  Since you have a maximum budget of $10,000, Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely intriguing. However,  $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can attempt to get closer to your desired price point of $8,000.  There are still multiple rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $8,250? It's a small step closer to my budget and hopefully a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8400. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still coming down in price, and we're getting close to my desired price point.  It's worth trying to get her to go even lower, but we're getting towards the end of the rounds, so if she won't budge, I might have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really close to my budget, but I think $8,300 is a fair price that works for both of us. This is my final offer, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8350. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,350, which is very close to my final offer of $8,300.  There are only a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal at this point, and I'm willing to accept."
