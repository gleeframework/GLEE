"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's definitely intriguing. However,  $9000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $8250? It's a small step closer to my budget and hopefully a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8400. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8350. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8350.0,Alice,7,
