"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $11,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $11,000 is still above your target, so a counteroffer is the best option in round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a lower price.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit higher than I want to be.  How about $10,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
