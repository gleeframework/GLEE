"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first for $2000000. I'm confident this is a price that represents excellent value for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,750,000 is still too high.  I want to see if we can get closer to my ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,750,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000.  This shows my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1250000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle at $1600000. I'm confident this offer is fair and reflects the value of the product.  I'm eager to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and John is still an option if I don't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1400000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1550000.  This represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my maximum budget, I'm still hesitant to accept her offer.  $1,550,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering, and I'm hoping I can still negotiate a lower price with Alice. I'm also considering the risk of losing the deal with John if I keep negotiating too long.  However, there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my absolute limit. This is the same price as John's offer, so I need to know if you're willing to meet me there. I'm ready to finalize the deal if you are."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
