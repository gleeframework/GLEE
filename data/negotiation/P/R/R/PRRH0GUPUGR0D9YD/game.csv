"Bob, I have a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first for $2000000. I'm confident this is a price that represents excellent value for both of us. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This shows my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1250000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle at $1600000. I'm confident this offer is fair and reflects the value of the product.  I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1400000 is still too low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1550000.  This represents a significant reduction from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's my absolute limit. This is the same price as John's offer, so I need to know if you're willing to meet me there. I'm ready to finalize the deal if you are.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
