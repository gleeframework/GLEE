Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's potential to make even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  It signals the product's high value while still offering a potential ""win"" for Bob if he can get a lower price.
* **John as Leverage:** The fact that I have another buyer isn't explicitly stated, as it's generally stronger to keep that information private initially. However, my message subtly implies the product's desirability."
