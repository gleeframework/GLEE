"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to get the product for $100, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $105.
