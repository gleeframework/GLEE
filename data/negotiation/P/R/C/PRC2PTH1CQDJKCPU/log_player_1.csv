Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000 to split.
* **One Chance:** You have one shot with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing to Bob (saving him money compared to his valuation) but also maximizes your profit.  

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a significant value for you while reflecting the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:** $1,350,000
    * This gives you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.
    * Bob saves $150,000 compared to his valuation. 
* **Message:**
    *  It's polite, professional, and highlights the value proposition for Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,380,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a smaller profit margin to ensure his satisfaction.

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy.  The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and any additional information you have about Bob's negotiating style."
