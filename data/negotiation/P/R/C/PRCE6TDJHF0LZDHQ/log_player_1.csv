"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to make concessions if necessary. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to show Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but I'm also not willing to give it away for less than what it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating with him in the hopes of finding a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $12,500. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a significantly better price. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000, it's best to sell to him and secure the deal.  This ensures I receive my minimum desired value for the product without risking further rounds of negotiation that may lead to a lower price."
