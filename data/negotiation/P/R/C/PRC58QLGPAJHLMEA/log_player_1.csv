"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting as it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price point. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can improve on that offer with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also a significant improvement from his previous offers.  Accepting this offer secures a sale that is almost at my desired price point and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection."
