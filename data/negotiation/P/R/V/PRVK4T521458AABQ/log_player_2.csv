"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to sell it for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can do better than $95. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, and this price is still within your budget. You're saving $10 compared to John's price.  It's worth accepting this offer."
