Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're looking for a price that works for both of us, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair jump from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about $95? This brings the price closer to my initial offer while still giving you a discount."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay within a tight budget, and $95 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do it for $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $80 is his absolute limit.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from him. Accepting his offer would net you less than selling to John.  Therefore, the best option is to cut your losses with Bob and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
