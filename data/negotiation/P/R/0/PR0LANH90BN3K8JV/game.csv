"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good price.  Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground here. $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,800. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go lower. ",9800.0,Alice,5,
