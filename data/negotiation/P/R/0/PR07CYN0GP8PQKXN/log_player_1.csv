Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. We're running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that is too low. It's time to sell to John and guarantee a price that meets my minimum requirement."
