"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1000000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to be sure the price aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $1100000 is closer to my range, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1080000 is getting close, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows us to both walk away happy with the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1060000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1060000.0,Alice,7,
