"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $11,500 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm offering $11,250. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  I believe it's still a good price for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.  I believe this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, we're running out of rounds. Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me at least my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
