,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
