"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. $900,000 is still too high considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiating.  While $700,000 is likely still a bit high for Alice, it's a starting point for further negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for compromise while still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high.  Bob has 7 rounds left and can continue to negotiate for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating flexibility by increasing his counteroffer slightly from $700,000 to $750,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further, as she rejected Bob's previous offer. This counteroffer positions Bob for a successful negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and at $825,000, the deal is getting close to Bob's ideal price. Accepting the offer would mean a significant savings for Bob, and with only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming more risky to continue negotiating.  There's always a chance Alice might increase her price again, or Bob might not be able to secure a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's a good time to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
