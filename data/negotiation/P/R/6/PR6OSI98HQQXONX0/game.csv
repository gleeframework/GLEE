"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while providing you with a valuable product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $700,000? That would make it much easier for me to finalize the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is still considerably below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and is a price point that allows me to move forward.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,6,
