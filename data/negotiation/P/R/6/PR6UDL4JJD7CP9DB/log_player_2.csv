"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer.  $800,000 is still a good chunk of change, and you have room to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $800,000 is still a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$750,000 is still a significant amount of money, and you can likely negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring further before committing to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $775,000 is still a bit high. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have a few more rounds left.  You can likely get a better deal if you keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your compromise, I'm still stuck at $725,000. This is my final offer.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell it to you for $765,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're still only a couple rounds away from your target. It's worth pushing for that lower price. Remember, you have the option to buy from John at any time, so you're not under extreme pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for $740,000. It's a fair compromise considering the price we've been discussing. I'm confident this deal will work out if we meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 740000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not willing to go below $765,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give away more value. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll sell it to you for $752,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $752,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $752,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're in the final round, and it's unlikely Alice will budge much further. The price of $752,500 is a good compromise and saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the deal and avoid risking a further decline in the price."
