"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 

This approach aims to get the negotiation going while still maximizing my potential profit. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and far less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Negotiation room:** I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I believe there's room for a compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if I don't get a satisfactory price from Bob.

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my own costs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $18,000 to $13,000.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and my own costs to make my price seem reasonable.
* **Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a mutually acceptable price.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a deal. I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $9,500. 
* **John's offer as backup:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $15,000, which gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,000?  This would allow both of us to reach a compromise and ensure a successful transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I'm framing the offer as a solution that benefits both of us, emphasizing a win-win situation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive tone and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob, considering it's closer to his budget while still being closer to my desired price.  I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
