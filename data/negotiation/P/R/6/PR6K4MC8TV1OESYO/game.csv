"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value and my own costs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer that reflects both the value of the product and my financial constraints.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $11,000?  This would allow both of us to reach a compromise and ensure a successful transaction. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
