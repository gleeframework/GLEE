Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy at play:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if you started closer to his valuation.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and a 24-hour limit create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly, potentially reducing his time to overthink or research alternatives.
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, mentioning ""unique value"" and ""benefits"" provides a vague justification for the high price without revealing specific information.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Have a negotiation strategy in mind, knowing your absolute minimum ($800,000) and your desired target.
* **Risk Tolerance:** This aggressive strategy has the potential for higher profit but also a higher chance of Bob rejecting the offer outright.  
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer in John. This knowledge allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
