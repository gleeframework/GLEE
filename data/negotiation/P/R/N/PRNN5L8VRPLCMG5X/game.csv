"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I've assessed its worth and believe a price of $1,000,000 would be fair for both of us.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the value it brings.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $900,000 is still below the value I've assessed for this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a price of $950,000.  This price reflects both the value I see in the product and your budget constraints.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,3,
