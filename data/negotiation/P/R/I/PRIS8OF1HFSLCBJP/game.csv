"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
