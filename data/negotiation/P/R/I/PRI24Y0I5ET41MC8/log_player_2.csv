{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's valuation.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $750,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This price is also below Alice's valuation, making it potentially attractive to her."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, $825,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise.  $775,000 is a middle ground between his previous offer of $750,000 and Alice's latest offer of $825,000.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also wants to secure a fair price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but getting closer.  Continuing to reject the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  It's better to try and squeeze out a bit more savings before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap.  $790,000 is a compromise between his previous offer of $775,000 and Alice's latest offer of $815,000.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is committed to reaching an agreement while still aiming for a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to make a counteroffer and see if Alice will come down further.  It's worth trying to squeeze out a bit more savings before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily pushing the price down, and now it's time to make a final push. $800,000 is a significant amount of money, and it's also Alice's valuation for the product.  This offer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a fair price, but he is also trying to get the best deal possible. 

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's next offer:** If Alice counters with a price close to $800,000, it might be worthwhile to accept to close the deal.
* **Buy from John:** If Alice is unwilling to budge, Bob can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
