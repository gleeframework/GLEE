"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $155? It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $157.50. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",157.5,Alice,5,
