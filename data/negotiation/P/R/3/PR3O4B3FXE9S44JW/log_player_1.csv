"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. My asking price is $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your asking price of $14,000. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $12,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $13,500? I think this price is fair considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $12,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my last counteroffer. This is a significant improvement from the initial $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $14,000, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Additionally, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a worse deal (or even no deal) outweighs the benefit of pushing for a slightly higher price."
