Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified without explicitly stating it's worth that much to you.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts suggests flexibility and openness to discussion.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts the $15,000, you significantly exceed your minimum.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can potentially still settle above your $12,000 minimum.
3. **Maintain John as Backup:** By offering it to Bob first, you don't risk losing John's guaranteed $12,000 offer."
