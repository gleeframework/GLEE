Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he counters.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, great! If he counters, I know he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm not overly attached to this offer because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
