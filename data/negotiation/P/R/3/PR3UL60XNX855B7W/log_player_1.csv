"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I know Bob values the product. I'm hoping to get a good price and avoid having to deal with John, who is a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $100.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum of $100. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a little bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to try and reach a mutually acceptable price. There's still a chance I can get a better deal with Bob, and I want to explore that before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $90. I'm feeling confident that Bob is willing to go a little higher, and this price is still within my acceptable range.  I want to see if he'll meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not happy with it. I'm holding out for a slightly better price, and I'm confident that I can get it. I'll try to negotiate with Bob one more time. If he refuses, I'll be willing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I've lowered my price significantly, but I'm not willing to go lower. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John."
