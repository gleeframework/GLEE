Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. He might try to negotiate further down, or he might reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your potential profit."
