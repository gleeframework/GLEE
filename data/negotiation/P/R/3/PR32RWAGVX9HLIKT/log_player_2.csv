"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a good deal, you can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's always better to save money when possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy in this case."
