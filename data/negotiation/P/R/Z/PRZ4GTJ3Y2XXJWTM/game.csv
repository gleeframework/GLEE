"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This would still leave you with a significant profit considering the value of the product to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10500 is still a bit low. How about we compromise at $11500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit from this product.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'll offer $11000, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you.",11000.0,Bob,6,
