Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Agreement:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not price Bob out completely.  There's no harm in starting with an offer that's beneficial to you, as long as it leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  The $1,400,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves you with a good profit margin over your guaranteed sale.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone encourages Bob to counter-offer, starting the negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate.  If Bob outright rejects the price, you can always adjust downwards, knowing your bottom line is secure."
