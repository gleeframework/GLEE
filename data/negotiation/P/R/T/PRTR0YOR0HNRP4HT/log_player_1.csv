{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
