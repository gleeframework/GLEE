"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is much higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $775,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be completely transparent, I'm working with a pretty strict budget. I could potentially make $700,000 work.  Would that be acceptable?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $725,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $710,000.  This is really pushing my budget, but I'm serious about acquiring this product.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $710,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $725,000 again. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",725000.0,Alice,7,
