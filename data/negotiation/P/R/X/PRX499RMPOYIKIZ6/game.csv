"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own limitations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum requirements.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and what I'm able to pay.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm within $50,000 of your last offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle from here.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to close this deal, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $900,000.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $910,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options.",910000.0,Alice,9,
