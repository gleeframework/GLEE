"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $100 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer it to you for $110.  This is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I really want to work with you on this. I understand you're sticking to your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a better deal than you can find elsewhere.",105.0,Alice,5,
