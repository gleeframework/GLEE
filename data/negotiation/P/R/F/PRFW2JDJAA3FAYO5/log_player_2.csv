# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1600000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. If you're interested, let me know. If not, I have another buyer lined up at $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
