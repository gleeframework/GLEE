Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least that much to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if needed. However, it's still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, considering his own valuation.  I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than what the product is worth to me.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $850,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This price would be fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price, and I risk losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale at my desired price."
