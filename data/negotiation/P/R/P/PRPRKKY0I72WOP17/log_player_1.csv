Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're aiming to earn more than $8,000.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:** This gives Bob a clear incentive to buy as he stands to save $2,000. 

By offering a price in the middle, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting while still securing a profit for yourself."
