Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below John's price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially getting you even closer to $150. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While $140 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it's presented as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, which can sometimes be effective.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept, but it gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum sale price."
