It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $800,000, so there's room for a deal."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target price."
