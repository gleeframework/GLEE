""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe a price of $12,000 represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $12,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it's still a substantial discount from your backup offer of $15,000. This might be enticing enough for Bob to consider. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, suggesting you're open to discussing the price further if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob will outright reject $12,000. However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's little risk in aiming high initially."
