Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"" helps justify the high price.
* **Round number:** Using a round number like $1,200,000 makes it seem more deliberate and strategic.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, his willingness to pay might be influenced by factors like available funds, perceived value, and negotiation skills.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price (no less than $800,000) will guide your negotiation strategy."
