"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that reflects the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm curious to see if Bob finds this price appealing or if he counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there is still potential to get a higher price. I will reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming for a win-win situation for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While it's tempting to accept since it's still more than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise that is fairer for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it before we risk running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and we are running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk a deal falling through with Bob. It's time to secure a sale with John at the guaranteed $1,500,000."
