"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the rarity of this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it.  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750000, which is closer to our previous negotiation.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close a deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. After re-evaluating the market and the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, considering the product's rarity and the effort I've invested in it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, $825000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with. To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to offer $800000. I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product and would allow us to finalize the transaction. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
