"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,850,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
