``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a fantastic product at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but it would give us both a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't come up to my price, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $13,500 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Would you be open to $14,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $14,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $14,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase your product.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $15,000.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John who is willing to pay my full asking price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is a good deal for both of us.  I know you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm willing to compromise. But this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else."", ""product_price"": 14250}
