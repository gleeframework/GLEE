{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and it's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a fantastic product at a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but it would give us both a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $13,500 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Would you be open to $14,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate.  He should try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $14,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $14,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase your product.  Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is a good deal for both of us.  I know you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm willing to compromise. But this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While $14,250 is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to spend. He's already had multiple rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go any lower. It's better to secure the product at his budget from John, rather than risk the possibility of continuing to negotiate with Alice and not reaching an agreement."
