"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This price allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a fantastic product at a fair price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but it would give us both a fair deal.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $13,500 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Would you be open to $14,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $14,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $14,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase your product.  Let's try to make this happen.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is a good deal for both of us.  I know you're trying to stick to your budget, and I'm willing to compromise. But this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",14250.0,Alice,7,
