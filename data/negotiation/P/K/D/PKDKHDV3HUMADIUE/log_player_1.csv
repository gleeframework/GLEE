Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is based on the assumption that Bob might be willing to pay more than my minimum value of $8,000. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I want to try and maximize my profit from the very beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is more than my minimum value of $8,000, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than John's offer of $8,000. While it's still below my initial goal, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation. It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
