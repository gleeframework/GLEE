This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While I want to maximize my profit, selling to John is always a guaranteed $12,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it's closer to my price point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 as a counteroffer. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a quality product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would like to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise my value. I will counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my price point, I will sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,250 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,250. I would like to propose $11,000 as a counteroffer. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a quality product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.

```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to compromise my value.  John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000, so it makes more sense to sell to him."
