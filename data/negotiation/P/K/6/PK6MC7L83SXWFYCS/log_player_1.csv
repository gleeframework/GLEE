"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, it's still too low given the room for negotiation in the previous round. I'll try to see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's initial offer but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal. I'm hoping this will start a constructive back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. $16,000 is a significant profit over my minimum and worth closing the deal for."
