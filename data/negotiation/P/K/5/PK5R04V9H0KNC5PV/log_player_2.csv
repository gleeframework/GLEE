# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
