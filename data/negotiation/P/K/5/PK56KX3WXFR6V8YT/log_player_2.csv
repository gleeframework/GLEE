"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is still a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Could you do it for $110?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is coming down, and $120 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept a decent deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay $150 to John."
