"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair price considering the current market and my financial situation.",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that you're looking for a price within your budget, Bob. However, I have to be mindful of the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. Is that something you'd be interested in?"
