Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The $12,000 asking price ensures you'd make a profit even if Bob negotiates you down somewhat.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, giving you leverage.  If Bob outright rejects the initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can always counter-offer closer to his valuation if you choose."
