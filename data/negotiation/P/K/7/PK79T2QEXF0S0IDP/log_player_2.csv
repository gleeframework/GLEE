"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a very reasonable price of $12,000. I think it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget than her previous offer, it's still over his $8,000 limit.  He can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price.  It's time to counter again and see if he can get closer to his target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,750. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $8,000 limit. It's likely that further negotiations with Alice won't result in a price lower than what John is offering.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for a guaranteed $8,000."
