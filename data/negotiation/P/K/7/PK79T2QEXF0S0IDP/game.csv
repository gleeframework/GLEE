"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints but I can't go as low as $8,500.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $9,375?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",9375.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,750. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",9750.0,Alice,5,
