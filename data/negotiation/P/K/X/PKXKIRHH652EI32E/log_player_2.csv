"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate!  Even if Alice is firm on $100, you can still try to get her to budge a little. You've got nothing to lose by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $90, which is within my budget and a good deal. I'll accept her offer."
