"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. We're willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. We think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be sure the price reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your concerns about the price, but we're not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. There are still 7 rounds remaining, which gives Bob time to potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but it also reflects my budget limitations.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We understand your budget constraints, but we're not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. We're willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1,280,000. This is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price, but $1,280,000 is still above his maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, and the negotiations seem to be moving in the right direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,260,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1260000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We're willing to make another adjustment to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. We're willing to meet you at $1,270,000. This is our final offer, and we hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,270,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  Since this is Alice's final offer, and there are only 3 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept the offer to avoid risking losing the deal altogether.  It's also possible that Alice will become more firm in her position in the remaining rounds. Accepting the offer at this stage ensures Bob gets the product, even if it's not at his absolute ideal price."
