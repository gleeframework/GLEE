,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14,000.

"I can see you're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $12,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $15,000.
