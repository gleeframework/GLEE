"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the special introductory price, it's unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12500 for the product. This price reflects its high value and unique features while remaining competitive. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial considerations.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11000. This would be a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
