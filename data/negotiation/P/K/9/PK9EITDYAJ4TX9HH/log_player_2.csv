"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to offer the product to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting the $850,000 offer secures a good price within your budget and limits the risk of the negotiation falling apart.  There's always a chance Alice might not budge further, and you might end up paying more or buying from John at a higher price."
