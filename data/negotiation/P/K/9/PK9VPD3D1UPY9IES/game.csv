"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling a bit more comfortable with $950,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to counter with $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to where I need to be.  While I value this product, $1,025,000 is still a bit above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $950,000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $950,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm going to counter with $1,015,000. This is my final offer, and I expect it to be a fair price for both of us.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm not going to let you off that easily. I've done my research, and I know you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for this product. I'm going to counter with $1,005,000. This is a small concession, but it's the last one I'm willing to make. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1005000.0,Alice,9,
