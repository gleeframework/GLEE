"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its worth to you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of the product's value to you, considering its worth to me is $800,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'd like to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob wants to pay, but it's closer to his target.  Bob should try to negotiate further by making a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue to negotiate in good faith."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to find common ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll counter with $975,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his last counteroffer of $950,000. This is a good compromise, allowing Bob to save $225,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a broken deal."
