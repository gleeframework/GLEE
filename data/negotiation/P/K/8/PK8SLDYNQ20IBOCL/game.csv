"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to acquire the product at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of the product's value to you, considering its worth to me is $800,000. I'm open to further discussion, but I'd like to meet you halfway.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue to negotiate in good faith.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to find common ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. I'll counter with $975,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.",975000.0,Alice,5,
