Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a substantial starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This represents a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll dramatically increase his offer beyond $1,000,000. Selling to John guarantees I receive the full value of the product without further risk or time spent negotiating."
