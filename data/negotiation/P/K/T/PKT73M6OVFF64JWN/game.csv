"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still very interested, but $1,100,000 is a little more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
