"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's seriously interested in buying the product and how much value he places on it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident that I can get a better price. He's already shown interest by making a counteroffer, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. I'm hoping to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $925,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can squeeze out a little more, especially since Bob is still actively negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a final attempt to meet in the middle. Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I've already reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures I reach my minimum and avoids any further risk of losing more money."
