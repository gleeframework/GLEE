"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is a bit lower than I can go right now, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it would help me cover some of my costs.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to cover your costs, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $128. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",128.0,Bob,4,
