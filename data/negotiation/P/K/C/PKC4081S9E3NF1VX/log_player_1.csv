"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. I want to maximize my potential profit, but I also don't want to scare him away with an unreasonable initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John right now and guarantee $1,200,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,200,000 because I believe I can still secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to drop my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is a significant move, but I believe Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,225,000. This is a small move, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  We're getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will convince Bob to close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get my desired price from Bob.  I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and guarantees I don't lose out on the sale."
