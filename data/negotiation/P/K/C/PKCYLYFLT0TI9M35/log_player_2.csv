{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $11,000. 
* There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price. 
* It's always worth trying to negotiate before resorting to the backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than her value of $10,000, suggesting there's room for a lower price.
* Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, splitting the difference between your maximum and Alice's potential minimum. 
* This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while leaving some room for Alice to counter back if she wants to continue the process."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than her value of $10,000, but it's closer to my maximum price. 
* However, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. 
* It's worth risking another round of counteroffers to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within my budget, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* Offering $11,000 is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate further while also considering the possibility that Alice may not be willing to go lower.
* If Alice rejects this offer, I can either make a final counteroffer in the next round or accept her price, as it's closer to my budget and we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,600 is getting closer to my maximum budget of $12,000, but it's still higher than what I'm aiming for.
* With only 5 rounds left, it's still worth risking another counteroffer to see if I can get a lower price.
* If Alice rejects my counteroffer in the next round, I can either make a final offer or consider buying from John, as the price difference becomes smaller."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,600 is getting closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay a little more but want to try and get the price down further.
* Offering $11,250 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Alice's offer of $11,600.
* With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting more risky to continue negotiating, but I'm still hopeful that Alice will accept a price closer to my target. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,650 is just $350 away from my maximum budget of $12,000.
* With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. 
* There's a good chance Alice will not budge further, and I might end up buying from John at $12,000.
