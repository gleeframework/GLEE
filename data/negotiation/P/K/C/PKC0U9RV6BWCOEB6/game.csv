"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-end product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product, and $9000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to propose a price of $10500 to make it work for me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $9800. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, and $9800 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to propose a price of $11000 to make it work for me. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding the right buyer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about making a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I propose a price of $10200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort you've put into finding the right buyer. Can you meet me at this price?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10200. I've been thinking about the product's value, and I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm proposing a price of $11500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into finding the right buyer. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $11500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I propose a price of $10500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort you've put into finding the right buyer. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $11500 earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $10500, which would be $11000. I'm willing to make a final concession to try to reach an agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I propose a price of $10700. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",10700.0,Bob,10,
