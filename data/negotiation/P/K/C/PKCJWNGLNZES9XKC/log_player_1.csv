Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is a bit higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive and friendly:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard line with my initial offer, recognizing that Bob might counteroffer. This is part of the negotiating process. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and the potential for a back-and-forth negotiation. If it looks like we're not going to reach an agreement, I'll be prepared to sell to John to ensure I receive at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $13,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While his offer is low, it's not too far off from my minimum.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John as a last resort:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial asking price. I'll try to be reasonable and show that I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work for me.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial price.  $12,500 is a midpoint between my minimum and Bob's offer, showing that I'm taking his concerns seriously.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and suggesting that $12,500 is a fair deal for both of us. This could make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Room for flexibility:**  While I'm closer to my desired price, I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to accept the deal with John.  However, I'm hopeful that $12,500 will be a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $12,250.  If you're willing to go that low, we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,500, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take time and potentially lead to a situation where I have to sell to John at the last minute.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. This ensures that I get a price that's very close to my minimum while avoiding the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
