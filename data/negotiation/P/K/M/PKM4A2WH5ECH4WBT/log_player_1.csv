"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay closer to my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being rigid with the price and implying I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below it.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds remaining and can still negotiate a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can encourage him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I'm confident this price will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potential for a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** By counter-offering, I keep the negotiation moving forward and show that I'm serious about getting a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. This is my best offer given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still falls short of my desired price.
* **Limited Time:** I have only 6 rounds remaining, but there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I can try to push Bob a little higher by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $960,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To make this work, I need to be at $970,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the time we've both invested in this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm only increasing the price by $10,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but also holding firm on my desired price range.
* **Time Investment:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the time invested in the negotiation, hoping to make him more willing to budge a bit further.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob and emphasizing a ""fair"" price, appealing to his sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe we're getting close. I'd like to propose a final offer of $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** I have only 4 rounds remaining, so the pressure is on.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still push Bob a little higher with a counteroffer. 

I'm going to try to negotiate a price closer to my minimum before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a final offer, but $965,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer.  How about we settle on $967,500? It's a small increase, and it allows us to finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 967500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing the price only slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to get closer to my minimum.
* **Final Offer Frame:** I'm suggesting this is a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Increase, Big Impact:**  The small increase might make Bob more likely to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Focus on Closure:** I'm highlighting the potential for finalizing the deal, appealing to Bob's desire for a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to go up to $962,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  I only have two rounds left, and Bob is not willing to go much higher.
* **Minimum Not Reached:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity.

While it's frustrating to not get a higher price, it's better to secure a guaranteed sale than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
