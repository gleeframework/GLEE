"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer on it, but I need to be within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a fair price for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
