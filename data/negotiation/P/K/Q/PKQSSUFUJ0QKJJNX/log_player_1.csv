I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to this price as possible, but I'm prepared to go lower if Bob pushes back and I feel it's necessary to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell at that price.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him my minimum price of $12,000. I'm hoping he will accept, as it's still a good deal for him, and I can't go lower without losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,000. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm going to try to push for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm going to lower my price to $11,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as it's a good deal for both of us. I don't want to go lower than this, as I'm getting closer to my minimum."
