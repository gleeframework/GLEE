"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price.  You're willing to go up to $12,000 and Alice is likely willing to sell for less than that."
