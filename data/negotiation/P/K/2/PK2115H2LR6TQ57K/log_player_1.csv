"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $9,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum value, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm offering $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount on the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit far from the value I think the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,250 is a fair compromise and a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's also getting close to the midpoint of our initial valuations, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk further negotiation."
