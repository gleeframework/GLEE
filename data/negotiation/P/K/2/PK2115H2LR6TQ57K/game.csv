"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm offering $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount on the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit far from the value I think the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. Can we meet in the middle?",10250.0,Bob,4,
