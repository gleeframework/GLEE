"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Bob has reached a point where accepting Alice's offer is a better deal than buying from John. While he'd prefer a lower price, he's only got 3 rounds left to negotiate.  It's more advantageous to close the deal now and avoid the risk of running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
