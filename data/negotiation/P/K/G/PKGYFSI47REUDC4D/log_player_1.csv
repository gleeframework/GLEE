Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a reasonable starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140.  It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering I'm willing to accept $130."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm not sure how much more I can get from him. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit while also avoiding the risk of ending up with $100 from John."
