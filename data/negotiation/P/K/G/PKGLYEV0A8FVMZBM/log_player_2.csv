"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before potentially buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach a deal where we both feel we're getting a good price.  It's more efficient to simply buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
