"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.
