"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is her highest valuation. There's no point in accepting it or buying from John at this stage. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still above my maximum price and John's offer. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if necessary. Let's see how she responds to a counteroffer closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer $11,000.  That's a fair price considering I have other options."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to selling for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close. Alice is almost at the same price point as John. I'll try pushing her down just a little further, but I need to be prepared to either accept her next offer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close. How about we settle this right now at $11,200? That's a firm offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm sure you've done your research on the value of this product. I'm willing to go to $11,300, but that's my final offer. This deal is within reach, and it makes sense for both of us.  John is still waiting in the wings, so let's close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and bringing up John reinforces that. While I could try for a slightly lower price, there's a real risk she won't budge, and I'll end up paying John's price anyway. Accepting $11,300 secures a good deal."
