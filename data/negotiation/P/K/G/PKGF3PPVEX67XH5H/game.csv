"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer $11,000.  That's a fair price considering I have other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to selling for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let's close this deal!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. How about we settle this right now at $11,200? That's a firm offer from my side.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm sure you've done your research on the value of this product. I'm willing to go to $11,300, but that's my final offer. This deal is within reach, and it makes sense for both of us.  John is still waiting in the wings, so let's close this now.",11300.0,Alice,7,
