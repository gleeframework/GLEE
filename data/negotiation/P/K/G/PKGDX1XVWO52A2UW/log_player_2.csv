{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. She's offering the product for $112, which is within your budget of $120. It's a good deal for you, and you've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  While you could try to push for a lower price, it's likely Alice won't go any lower.  It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with rather than risk losing the deal."
