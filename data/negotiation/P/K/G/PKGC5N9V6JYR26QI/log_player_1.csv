We're getting closer, but Bob is still quite a bit away from our desired price.  We're willing to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While we'd prefer a higher price, Bob is holding firm. Accepting his offer at $850,000 is a substantial profit and preferable to the risk of him walking away or us having to accept John's offer of $800,000 in a later round."
