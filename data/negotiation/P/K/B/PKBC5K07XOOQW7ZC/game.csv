"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
