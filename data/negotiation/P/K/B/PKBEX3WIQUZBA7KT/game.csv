"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but given its worth to me is only $800,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $850,000 for this product. I believe this price is fair and within our previous discussions. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
