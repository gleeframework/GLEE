Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. Would you be open to negotiating further?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our offers at $12,750. This price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still more beneficial to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  Further negotiation with Bob might not result in a better outcome."
