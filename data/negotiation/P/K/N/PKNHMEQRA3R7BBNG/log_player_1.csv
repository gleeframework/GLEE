"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, as I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product. I'm aware that it might be too high, but I'm willing to negotiate if necessary.  If he rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but shows a willingness to negotiate. This price allows for some wiggle room in future rounds, but it's still closer to my initial target."
