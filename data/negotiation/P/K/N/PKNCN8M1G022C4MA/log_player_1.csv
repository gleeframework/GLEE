Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also gives me some buffer in case Bob counters.
* **The message:** It's friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer without being pushy. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I'm also willing to negotiate. I'm aware that if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,000:** This price is still above Bob's offer of $9,500 but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and reiterate the value of the product, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for an unreasonable price. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the option of selling to John if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount.  I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than $10,800."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there with $10,800. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $10,900:** This is a small compromise, showing I'm willing to meet halfway but still pushing for a higher price.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** I acknowledge Bob's interest and reiterate the value proposition, while maintaining my stance and not appearing desperate.

I believe that $10,900 is a good compromise and offers a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000, but I'm ready to walk away if Bob continues to hold firm at $10,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, I'm not willing to sell the product at a significant loss.  John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my desired price, so it's in my best interest to sell to him.  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
