"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $9500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing you to get a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product could be a great fit for me.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there with $10800. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10900. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
