"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. Let's keep talking.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $875,000 is still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle on $912,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there. How about we go with $900,000? That's just a small step from your last offer, and it would be a good compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,7,
