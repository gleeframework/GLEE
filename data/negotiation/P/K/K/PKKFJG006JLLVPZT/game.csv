Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering its value and quality.,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is there any room for negotiation?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value and quality.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $140. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $155 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $155, which is $147.50. Can you consider that price?",147.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $147.50. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $152.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",152.5,Alice,7,
