{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's valuation but not excessively so. It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating your desire to sell the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches the product's value to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm open to a slight compromise.  How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and closer to my desired price than his previous offers.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
