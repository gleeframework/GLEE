"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  We can always buy from John for $100 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial price, but still leaves room for us to go up if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price that beats John's offer. Let's try to meet her halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that the product has value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her offer of $105 and our previous offer of $85. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows we're willing to compromise, but not at the cost of exceeding our budget or John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our price target. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as we can't get a better price from John."
