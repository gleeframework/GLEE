"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while ensuring I still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering $105, which is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to his offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, which is exactly the value Bob perceives for the product.  This is a good compromise that ensures I get a reasonable price while also offering Bob a good deal."
