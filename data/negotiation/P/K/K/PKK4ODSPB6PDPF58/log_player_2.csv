"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very beneficial. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, Alice's final offer of $1,150,000 is still a good price and saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John. It's unlikely Alice will come down much further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
