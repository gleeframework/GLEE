Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $620,000. I'm willing to meet you at $630,000, which is a small discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $630,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $630,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to move in smaller increments. Accepting at $630,000 secures a significant discount from her original offer and the potential savings from continuing to negotiate are likely to be small.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations stalling and ending up with John's less favorable offer."
