"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong opening offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,800.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $9,000. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,100 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try $8,900.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",8900.0,Bob,6,

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,050. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
