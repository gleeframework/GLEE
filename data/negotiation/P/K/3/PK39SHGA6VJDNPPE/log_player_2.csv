"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to start with a strong opening offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $1,000 above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a slight improvement from her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,800.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $9,000. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,100 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try $8,900.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,900. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to stay above $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,050. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,050 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference at $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a win.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $9,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to stay above my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $9,000. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,025. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,025. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,025
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his desired price, and there's only one round left before he has to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer at $9,025 saves Bob $975 compared to buying from John.  While there's a small chance Alice might accept a counteroffer, the risk of losing a better deal isn't worth it at this point."
