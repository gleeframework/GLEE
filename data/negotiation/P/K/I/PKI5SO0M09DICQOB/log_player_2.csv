"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a price that works for both of us.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on a starting price of $1300000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1100000 is a bit below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still allows me to get a fair return while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  While I could buy from John for $1,000,000, I might be able to get a better deal with Alice if I continue to negotiate.  I will reject her offer and send a new counteroffer."
