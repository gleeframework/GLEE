{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. This also shows you're willing to negotiate, which can be helpful in securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $110 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 120}
