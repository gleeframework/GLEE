"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I believe this product is worth around $6,000 to me. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
