{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's something you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $120 but below your minimum of $150. This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still giving him a potentially good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
