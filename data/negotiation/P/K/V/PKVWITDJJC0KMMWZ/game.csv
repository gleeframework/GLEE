"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't quite meet that number, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but to be honest,  $1,100,000 is too far off from what I  consider a fair deal. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made. However, I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I can't justify going above $1,150,000. If you're willing to reconsider, I'm ready to close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
