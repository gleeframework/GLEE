"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. It's likely that Alice will go lower than $600,000, so it's better to reject and see what counteroffers come."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that signals my intention to negotiate aggressively. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but hopefully, it will get the negotiation moving in the right direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a price higher than I'd like.  There's room to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still well below Alice's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but that I'm also serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$500,000 is still a bit higher than I want to pay, and we have a few rounds left. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 475000}
``` 

I'm raising my offer again, but still keeping it under $500,000.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm also not willing to overpay.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $487,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $487,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good price, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to accept the offer before we risk having to buy from John at a much higher price."
