Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept $120, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $20 difference leaves room for both of you to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price.  You can counteroffer with a price that's closer to your minimum while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to your goal:**  This counteroffer is closer to your minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Remaining within Bob's range:**  $95 is still within Bob's perceived value of $80, suggesting that you're willing to compromise but also value the product.
* **Clear and concise message:**  The message is short and emphasizes the value of the product and the compromise you've made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $85. This is my final offer, as I am not able to pay more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to your minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still considerably below your desired price point. Since Bob has indicated this is his final offer, it's risky to continue negotiating.  However, selling to John for $120 is a much better outcome, so rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation is the better choice. 

You can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $85, but be prepared to accept a price closer to $90 if you want to finalize a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to someone else. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This counteroffer is a slight compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above his final price. 
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  The message highlights the potential for the deal to fall through, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $90 is a good compromise, potentially acceptable to Bob while still being relatively close to your desired price."
