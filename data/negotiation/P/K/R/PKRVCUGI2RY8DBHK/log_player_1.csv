"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a unique and valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Framing the offer:**  The message highlights the value and potential benefits of the product, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being aggressive or demanding, leaving the door open for counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget with this initial offer. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* I'll keep John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **More negotiation needed:**  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price at this stage.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints.
* I will continue to use John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $17,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects my willingness to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $17,000 is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting the discount:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my original offer to make the counteroffer more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, inviting Bob to continue the conversation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable value.
* I'm hoping that the discount and the positive tone will encourage Bob to reconsider his offer.
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and be prepared to either accept Bob's counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
