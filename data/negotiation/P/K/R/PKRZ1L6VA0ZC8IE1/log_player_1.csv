Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more enticing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the conversation open.

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of a quick deal. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his response or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate. I can try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not optimal yet.**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I might be able to squeeze out a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm decreasing my price, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Remaining firm on my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap while ensuring I still get a decent price. If Bob rejects, I'll have to reassess my position and decide whether to accept his price, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $910,000 for the product. This is the highest amount I can afford without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.**  We are now very close in price, and further counteroffers may result in a stalemate.
* **Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option.**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, which is more than what I can reasonably expect from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:** While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential gain. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed, high-value sale."
