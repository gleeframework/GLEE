"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $10,000. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,1,
