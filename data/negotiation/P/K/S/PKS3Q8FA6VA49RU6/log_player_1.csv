"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) as I want to maximize my earnings.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's likely Bob will reject this initial offer, but it gives me a starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge his interest level and get a sense of what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also indicates that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer. A price of $1,200,000 is a compromise that may be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we are already four rounds into the negotiation. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and allows me to finalize the transaction."
