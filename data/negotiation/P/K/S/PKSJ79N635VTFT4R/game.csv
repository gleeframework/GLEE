"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe it holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its potential worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm still quite interested, but $1,300,000 is a little too high for my budget. Could you do $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
