"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget, would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay above $100 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $107.50? This is a great price for such a high-quality product. Let me know what you think.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While I think $107.50 is closer to fair, I'm trying to keep my spending under $100 for this. Would you be willing to do it for $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
