"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) to give myself some room for negotiation. I'm also framing the message to be friendly and highlight the value of the product to Bob.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget, would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum and giving Bob a fair price while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to a potential deal,  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to stay above $100 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference at $107.50? This is a great price for such a high-quality product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. This offer is still a bit above my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While I think $107.50 is closer to fair, I'm trying to keep my spending under $100 for this. Would you be willing to do it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating.  I've made concessions, but Bob's still not meeting my minimum price. I've only got 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing a sale completely.  I'm going to sell to John for $150. At least that ensures I get my minimum price."
