"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still not quite there yet.  $10,000 is closer, but I need to be at least $11,000 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $11,000, Alice. I think I can do $9,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
