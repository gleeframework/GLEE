"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.

```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only got one round left, and while it's still above his ideal price, it's significantly lower than John's price, and the negotiation has reached a point where it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  Accepting this offer saves him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
