We've been negotiating for a while, and although Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  It's not the best price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
