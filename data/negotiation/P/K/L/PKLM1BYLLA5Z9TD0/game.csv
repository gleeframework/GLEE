"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to get a good return on my investment while being fair to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $975,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is the price I was willing to pay from the beginning. I'd be happy to accept the product at this price. Is this a deal?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
