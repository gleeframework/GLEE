"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's a significant price reduction from what I'd get from another buyer, and allows you a good profit margin. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's meet in the middle once more, at $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise that keeps us both closer to our desired price points. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to make one final offer of $950,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
