,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,125,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000, but I'd like to discuss the payment terms. Can we explore options for a discount or a payment plan that would bring the price down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,125,000.  Perhaps we can explore other ways to make the deal work for both of us, like including some additional services or a shorter delivery timeframe.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of additional services, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to consider the services separately, but for the product itself, I'd like to offer $1,075,000. Can we discuss the details of the services and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable deal?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still below what I need to accept.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1,100,000, and I'm open to discussing those additional services you mentioned.  This offer reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to discuss a package deal that includes some of the additional services you mentioned. Can we talk about bundling those services at a discounted rate?",1100000.0,Bob,8,
