"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
