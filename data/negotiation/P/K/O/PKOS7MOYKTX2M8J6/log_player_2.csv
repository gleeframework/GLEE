"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite high. There is a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to our budget.  We should make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay no more than $8,000, so we start significantly lower ($7,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses our interest in the product while being clear about our budget limitations. This encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $7,000, we're aiming for a final price somewhere between our initial offer and Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $8,500 is still above our maximum budget. We know we have John as a backup option at $8,000. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($7,000) to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Framing as ""Fair"":**  Using language like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Nearing the Backup:** We're getting close to John's price ($8,000). Alice might be willing to accept this offer rather than risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $8,250. This is only slightly above our ideal budget, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good compromise to save some money compared to John's offer while still securing the product."
