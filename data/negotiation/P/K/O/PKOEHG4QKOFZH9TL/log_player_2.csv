"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $95 is too close to your maximum, and Alice likely has room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
