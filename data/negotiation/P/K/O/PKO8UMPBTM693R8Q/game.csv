"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you halfway at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like where we're headed, Bob! $12,250 is a good step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum threshold. I can meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $13,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $12,500? That would help me feel good about the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see that $12,500 is a sweet spot for you, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $13,000? I think it's a fair price, and it's worth considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
