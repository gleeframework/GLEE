"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and the current market.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $800,000. That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
