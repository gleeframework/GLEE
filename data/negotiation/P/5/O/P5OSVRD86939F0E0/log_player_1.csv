Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short at $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $120 is still below Bob's perceived value, leaving space for him to counteroffer. 
* **It shows confidence:** A bold initial offer can make Bob think the product is worth more, potentially leading him to accept or counter with a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to come down to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and come down from your initial price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:** $110 is the midpoint between your last offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($100). This presents a reasonable compromise that could be attractive to Bob.
* **Maintaining Value:** While lower than your initial offer, $110 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit margin:** While not ideal, $105 is still above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There is a risk that if you reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, leaving you with only John's offer of $80. 
* **Time factor:**  It's unclear how many more rounds of negotiation would be needed to reach a higher price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit without risking further delays."
