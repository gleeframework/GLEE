"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being excited about the product. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was really hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me at 110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum price. Would you be willing to meet me at 112? It's a small step closer to my target, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
