{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth that much to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following:

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $10,000, so I'm not willing to go lower than that.
* **Bob's value:**  I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so I'm aiming for a price that is slightly above his valuation but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows for some negotiation. Bob can counteroffer, and I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and allowing for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still within the range of what's possible.  I can counteroffer and try to reach a compromise.
* **John as backup:**  I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Remaining flexible:** By offering $10,500, I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm making it clear that I won't go much lower. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a successful deal while staying true to my minimum price requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10000? This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further upside:**  There's no point in rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate, as I won't get a better price from him.
* **John's offer is the same:**  John is also willing to pay $10,000, so there's no advantage to selling to him instead of Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product at my minimum price, which is the best outcome given the current circumstances."
