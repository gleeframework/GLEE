"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10000? This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
