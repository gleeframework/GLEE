Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
