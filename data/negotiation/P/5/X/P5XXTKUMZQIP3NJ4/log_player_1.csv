"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd still like to get a bit more,  Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's a significant amount more than selling to John and we're getting close to the end of our rounds."
