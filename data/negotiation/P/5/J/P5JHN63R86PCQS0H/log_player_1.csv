Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. It offers a price that is higher than your minimum but not exorbitantly so. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving you a decent profit.  We'll adjust the strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth more than $1,200,000 to me, and selling to John is a guaranteed profit.  We'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that shows we're willing to negotiate. We're trying to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet us halfway."
