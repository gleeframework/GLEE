"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** $900,000 is less than $1,000,000. 
* **You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, which could pressure her to lower the price."
