"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $25,000 above Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and pushing for a lower price could risk her rejecting the offer completely.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob continues to reject offers, there's a chance Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further or will sell to another buyer.  Additionally, buying from John would cost $125,000 more. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price below his maximum and avoids potential risks associated with further negotiation."
