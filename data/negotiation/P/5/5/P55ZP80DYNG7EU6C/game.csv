"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,175,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're committed to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. I'm confident this price is fair given the product's value and our desire to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise that benefits both of us. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000, but I'd like to throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value. This way, you'll get even more value out of the product, and I'll still get a fair price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
