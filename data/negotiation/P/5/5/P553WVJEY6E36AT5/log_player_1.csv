Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with.  I believe it's fair given the value of the product and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob's counteroffers have been steadily decreasing, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with him will only result in a lower price.  John is offering my minimum threshold, and it's not worth risking a lower offer from Bob."
