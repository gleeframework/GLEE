"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high considering what I'm willing to pay. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 reflects its worth. This leaves room for negotiation, but shows my seriousness about finding a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
