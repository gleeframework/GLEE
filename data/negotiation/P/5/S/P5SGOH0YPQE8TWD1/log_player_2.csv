"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and my maximum price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite high considering what I'm willing to pay. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Justification:** By mentioning my willingness to pay, I'm subtly signaling that I have a limit.
* **Target Price:** My goal is to secure the product well below my $1,500,000 maximum. This counteroffer keeps me on track towards that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 reflects its worth. This leaves room for negotiation, but shows my seriousness about finding a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  Her counteroffer still leaves a decent amount of room for negotiation before reaching a price I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but we're still a bit far apart.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($100,000) to signal that while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also serious about my budget.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help facilitate a quicker agreement. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I want to keep the negotiation moving and prevent it from stalling."
