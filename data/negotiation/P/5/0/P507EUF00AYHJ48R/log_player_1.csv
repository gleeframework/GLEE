Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  While I value the product at more than $7,500, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'd be happy to pay $8,200 for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell it for closer to $8,500, Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
