"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about we try something around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to facilitate the deal. How about we meet at $900,000? This price still offers you a substantial benefit, and allows me to achieve my goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger leap than I can make right now. To be honest, anything over $800,000 just doesn't work for me financially.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I'm hoping we can find some middle ground here.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to accept $725,000. It's crucial for me to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  how about $850,000? This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to get a great deal while ensuring I achieve my financial goals. I'm confident this is a win-win solution for us both.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $775,000 as my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful you'll see the value in closing the deal today.",775000.0,Bob,6,
