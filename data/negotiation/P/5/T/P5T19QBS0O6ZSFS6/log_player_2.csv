"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not the best deal for Bob. He has a limit of $10,000 and wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price. Buying from John immediately would be the worst option, as it wouldn't allow for any negotiation and would result in the highest price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. While it's closer to his target, it's still not the best deal he could potentially get. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. Buying from John now would be a better option as he can get the product for a lower price than Alice's current offer. However, continuing the negotiation might result in a lower price and thus is the best option for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  This price is fair and allows both of us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
