"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
