"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the offer by mentioning the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, implying I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range, and significantly higher than selling to John for $80. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 10 rounds available, it's important to make decisions that maximize profit within the given timeframe."
