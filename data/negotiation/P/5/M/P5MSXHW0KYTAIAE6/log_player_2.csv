"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire something you value for less than you'd pay elsewhere, and it ensures I get a fair price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
