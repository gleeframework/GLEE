"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings and my budget constraints. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my budget.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
