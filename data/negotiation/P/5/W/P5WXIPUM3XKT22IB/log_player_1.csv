"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also setting a high bar for the potential value of the product in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,600,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to meet him halfway, while still leaving some room for a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,700,000 is a good price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to bargain."
