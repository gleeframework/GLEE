"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, it's still quite high. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is still a decent profit for Alice ($5 over her valuation). This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  It's a good starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is more than I'm comfortable paying. I'll reject and try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable price range for me.  I believe it's a fair offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking too much.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to pay more than $95.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  It's a good compromise, offering Alice a decent profit while still fitting within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is too high for me. I've already made my final offer of $95, and she rejected it.  At this point, buying from John for $120 is the better option. It guarantees I get the product within my budget, and I'm tired of negotiating with Alice."
