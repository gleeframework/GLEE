"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $800,000 is my absolute lowest price. I have another buyer ready at that price, but I believe you would benefit greatly from this product and I'd prefer to see it in your hands.  Let me know if you're able to meet this.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for explaining. I understand your position, and I'm glad you see the value I place on this product.  While $800,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming to stay under that. How about $775,000? This keeps us moving towards a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
