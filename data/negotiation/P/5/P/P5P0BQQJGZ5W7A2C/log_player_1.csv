Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I'm still aiming for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly sees the value of the product at $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me more leverage to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still represents a significant value for you and allows me to achieve a reasonable return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since I'm not under significant pressure to close the deal immediately.  By rejecting this offer, I keep the negotiation open and have more leverage to potentially reach a deal closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This price is still a good value for you, considering the significant benefit this product will bring to your business. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I am pleased to counteroffer at $1,060,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer from Bob is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. Considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he is likely reaching his limit. Accepting this offer would secure a good profit and ensure I don't risk losing the deal completely. It's time to lock in the sale."
