Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you really want this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for you.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  Since your maximum price is $80 and you have a guaranteed option with John, it makes more sense to go with him at this point."
