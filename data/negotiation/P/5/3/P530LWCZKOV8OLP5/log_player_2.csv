"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to get the product for $80 or less. Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're aiming for $80, but a jump straight to that might seem too aggressive. A counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable starting point, showing we're serious but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and provides a reason for the counteroffer, making it more likely for Alice to engage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $100.  That's still a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer, but $100 is still higher than your target of $80.  It's worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price. How about $95? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** We're showing Alice we're willing to negotiate and are getting closer to her price.
* **Moderate counteroffer:** $95 is a reasonable middle ground between our last offer ($90) and her offer ($100). 
* **Positive message:** The message stays positive and emphasizes the potential for a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $97.50 is still above your target of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have limited rounds left. You could try a counteroffer close to $95 to see if you can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $97.50.  Let's see if we can finalize this.  I'm willing to go up to $96.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Specific proposal:** Instead of just stating a price, we're proposing a solution to split the difference, making it more likely for Alice to see it as a fair deal.
* **Closing the deal:**  With limited rounds remaining, we're pushing for a final agreement."
