"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:** Costs you $110, saving you $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:** Costs you $120, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  Leads to you buying from John for $120.

It's always better to save money, even if it's a small amount."
