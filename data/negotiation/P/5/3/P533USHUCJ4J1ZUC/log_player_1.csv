"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer downward slightly in the next round.  Remember, you also have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left and can continue negotiating with Bob, or sell to John for $12,000.  I will counter Bob's offer, trying to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to see $11,150 to make this work. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has raised his offer to $11,000, which is very close to my target price of $11,500.  Although I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, accepting this offer is a good decision. I'm still getting a decent price and avoiding the risk of Bob rejecting further offers. Additionally, continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, making it more likely I'll have to sell to John for $12,000."
