"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to see $11,150 to make this work. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11,000. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
