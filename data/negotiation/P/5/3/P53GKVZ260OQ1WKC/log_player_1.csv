Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly staying in the $80-90 range.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly agree to a price that's significantly higher.  Since I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John, it makes the most financial sense to stop negotiating with Bob and take the sure thing."
