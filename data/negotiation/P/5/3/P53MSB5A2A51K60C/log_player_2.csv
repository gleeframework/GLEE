# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $1,400,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding where I'm coming from. While your offer is tempting, the product's value is substantial to me. Would you consider $1,650,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll counter again to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see your point about the value, but $1,650,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair given my budget and the value of the product to me. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
