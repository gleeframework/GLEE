It's always good to start by exploring the possibilities.  $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Let's start with a lower counteroffer to see where Alice stands.  $800,000 is still a good price for me, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $850,000.  That's a good price, and we've already saved $50,000 compared to John's offer.  Let's accept and close the deal."
