"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and $8000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $9000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $10000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,
