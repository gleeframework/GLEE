{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying within a profitable range.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" aims to justify the high price, even if the specific benefits aren't explicitly stated.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for further discussion and potential counter-offers from Bob.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a price significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation while still remaining attractive compared to her guaranteed sale option."
