Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can agree on this.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $111. It's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $110. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to wrap this up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely we'll get a better deal from Alice at this point. Accepting the $110 offer saves us $10 compared to John's price."
