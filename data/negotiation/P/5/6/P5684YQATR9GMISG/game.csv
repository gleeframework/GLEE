"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can agree on this.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $107? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $111. It's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal.",111.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to offer $109 to make this work. What do you say?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $110. That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to wrap this up.",110.0,Alice,7,
