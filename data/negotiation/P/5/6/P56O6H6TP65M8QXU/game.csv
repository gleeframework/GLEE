"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $11000. I'd be willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a good balance, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've already decided that $11200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",10000.0,Bob,6,
