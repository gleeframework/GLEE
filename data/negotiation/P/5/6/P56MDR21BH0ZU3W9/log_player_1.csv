Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  Could we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

We're still too far from our minimum. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  However, $11,500 is just too low. I can go down to $15,500, but that's my absolute final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your final offer is tempting, but still a stretch. I can do $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute limit.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap between his offer and our minimum of $15,000.  Therefore, it's in our best interest to accept John's standing offer of $15,000."
