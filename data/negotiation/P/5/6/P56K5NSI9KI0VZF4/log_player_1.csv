{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  I'll need to assess his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I could accept his offer and get $12,000, I'm willing to risk losing him as a buyer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
