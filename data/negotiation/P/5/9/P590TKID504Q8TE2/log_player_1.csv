Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $80.  While I could accept it and make a profit, it's not the best outcome. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $75. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $75, which is halfway between my desired price of $80 and Bob's offer of $65. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $65 is low, but $75 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is getting closer to my desired price of $80. While I would prefer more, accepting his offer ensures I sell the product and make a profit. It's a reasonable compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $80 or continuing to negotiate with Bob with the risk of him walking away."
