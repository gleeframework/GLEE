"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really value. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $110 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her wording suggests she might be open to a lower price.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $150, so you have some leverage."
