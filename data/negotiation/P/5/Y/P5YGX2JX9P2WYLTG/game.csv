"I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to my budget and allows us to reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $9,500. This is a good price for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price than $9,000.",9500.0,Alice,5,
