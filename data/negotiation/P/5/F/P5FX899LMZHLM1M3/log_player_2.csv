"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his target price of $8,000, and there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for a counteroffer, and Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,250 is very close to his target, he's still within his negotiation rounds and can try to push for a lower price. He's already demonstrated his willingness to walk away, giving him more bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still a little above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,125. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9125, but I'd like to add a small buffer to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9150. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. He has only 3 rounds remaining, and Alice's offer is still above his target.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out on the deal with John outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
