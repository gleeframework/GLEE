"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's split the difference and close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
