"Round 1

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and go for $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm almost there, Bob! I'm willing to take one more step closer. How about we meet at $9,050? It's still a great deal for me, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice is clearly getting closer to his desired price. Accepting this offer at $9,050 saves him $2,950 compared to buying from John. While he could try for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving him with only John's option."
