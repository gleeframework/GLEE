"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $155?  That's still a great deal for a product that's worth $150 to you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $145 is still just a little too low for me. How about we try $150? This would be a fair price for both of us, and you'd be getting a fantastic product at its true value.",150.0,Alice,5,
