Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I need to be mindful of my minimum, I can do better than $1,000,000. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial proposal. It shows flexibility while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below where I want to be.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to potentially selling to John."

This offer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm getting closer to John's offer, which is a factor in this counteroffer."

Bob's offer is now very close to John's offer, and I'm willing to take a slight loss to finalize a deal."
