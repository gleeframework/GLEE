Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price might be more desirable than waiting."
