"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's but still above your limit.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for $11,500.
* **You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer.**  Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, you have room to negotiate further. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not desperate and might be able to get a better price from her or find a better deal elsewhere."
