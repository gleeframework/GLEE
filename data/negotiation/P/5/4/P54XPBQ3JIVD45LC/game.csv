"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.",875000.0,Bob,4,
