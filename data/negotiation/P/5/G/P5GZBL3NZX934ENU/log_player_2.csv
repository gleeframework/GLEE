"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, leaving significant room for negotiation. As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to start a counter-offer process, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I appreciate the deal, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a lower price, pushing Alice to consider a significant discount. This strategy aims to set a strong starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Fair Value:**  My counteroffer is still above Alice's value for the product ($800,000), showing that I'm interested in a deal but not willing to overpay.
* **Concise and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the price point and expressing willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than my desired price point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle at $850,000 just yet. I'll continue to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and it's closer to what I can comfortably afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer, demonstrating that I'm not ready to settle.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating my perspective on the value of the product, making it clear that I'm not overpaying.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  I'm emphasizing the need to find a mutually agreeable price. This approach keeps the negotiation amicable while pushing for a better deal."
