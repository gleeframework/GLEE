"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to feel good about the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500? This would give us both a fair price and allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",7500.0,Alice,5,
