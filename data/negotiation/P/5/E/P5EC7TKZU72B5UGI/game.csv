"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now thinking of selling the product for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and settle on $9750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. ",9750.0,Bob,6,
