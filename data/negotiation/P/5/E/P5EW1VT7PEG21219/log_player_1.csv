"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but also consider that it's a reasonable price for a valuable product. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $80. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer.  It's still above my minimum value and hopefully, it will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even lower than his previous offer. I am not willing to sell for such a low price. I will reject his offer and see if he is willing to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering with $85. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but it's still above my minimum value and a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal, considering his previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round. I'm starting to get a bit nervous, but I still believe I can get a better deal with a little more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm lowering my price to $82. This is just slightly above my minimum value of $80 and is a clear sign to Bob that I'm serious about closing this deal. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept my offer. It's a good compromise that allows both of us to get what we want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm running out of time.  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk getting nothing or a lower price from Bob."
