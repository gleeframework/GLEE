"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your price point, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $11,500 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his limit, it's still above his target. He can try to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get a price closer to his $10,000 limit."
