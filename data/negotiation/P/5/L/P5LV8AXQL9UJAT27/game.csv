Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $110.,110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good middle ground.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $97.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this negotiation.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $102. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a good compromise. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",102.0,Alice,7,
