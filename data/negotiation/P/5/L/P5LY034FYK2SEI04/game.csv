"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, giving you a good return while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would give you a good deal, and I'd still be able to get a reasonable price for the product.  Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $875,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",875000.0,Bob,4,
