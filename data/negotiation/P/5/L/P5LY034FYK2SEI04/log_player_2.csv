"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a good deal for her, I need to negotiate further to get a price that works for me."
