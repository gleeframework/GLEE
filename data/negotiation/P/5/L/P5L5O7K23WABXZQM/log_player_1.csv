Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 offer:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation openness:**  Stating that I'm open to negotiation encourages Bob to counteroffer and keeps the conversation going.
* **John's offer as a fallback:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always sell to John for $80, providing a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum price of $80.
* Accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit.
* While I could potentially negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a higher price, and the risk of losing the sale entirely to John for $80 exists."
