"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's desired price point of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $108. This is the best I can do, considering the value I have in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $108 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **The price is getting closer to Bob's ideal:**  This offer is closer to Bob's desired price than his initial counteroffer of $105.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible and ultimately reject any future counteroffers. Accepting this offer secures the product at a decent price."
