"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and I would be happy to finalize the sale. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,
