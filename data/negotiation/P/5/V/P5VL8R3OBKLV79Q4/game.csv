"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would give you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my original counteroffer. How about we try $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1125000? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our objectives. If you're not willing to go this high, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
