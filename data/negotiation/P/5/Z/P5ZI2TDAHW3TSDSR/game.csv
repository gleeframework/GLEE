"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more to meet my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $15,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,5,,
