"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe a price closer to $1,200,000 is fair. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
