"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential. I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget ($1,200,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. There's potential to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, given my current budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate seriously without being completely unreasonable.
* **Clear Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer (budget constraints), which can help Alice understand your position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion, signaling that you're willing to compromise to find a mutually agreeable price."
