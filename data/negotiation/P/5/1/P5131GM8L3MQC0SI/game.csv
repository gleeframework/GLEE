"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a good profit margin. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $15500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $15500, Alice. I've done some research and I think I can get a similar product from another supplier for $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've done your research, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I'm not going any higher than that. It's getting close to the price I can get from John, and I'm starting to consider going with him. Can you reconsider?",14000.0,Bob,8,
