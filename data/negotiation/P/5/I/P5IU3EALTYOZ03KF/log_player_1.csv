Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

We're still significantly below my minimum.  It's time to push Bob a bit more aggressively towards a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's a $25,000 profit over my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties if I continue negotiating or switch to John.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, which can be beneficial for future interactions."
