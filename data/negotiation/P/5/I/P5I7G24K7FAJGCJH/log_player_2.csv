"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is way over your budget of $80. You can do better.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $80, it makes sense to start with your top offer. This sets the negotiation framework and shows Alice you're serious about getting the product at a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating. It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has already lowered her price from $120 to $110, it's reasonable to assume she's willing to negotiate further.  A counteroffer of $90 is a good compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway. It's also within your budget and leaves room for a final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $105 is still outside of your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a better deal, especially since you have five rounds left and a backup option with John.  You can potentially get a better deal if you keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $110 to $105, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer of $95  shows you're meeting her halfway while still staying within your budget. This is a good strategy to try and reach a compromise and secure the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still higher than your budget of $80, and we're already at round 7.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price drastically enough to meet your target.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your desired price."
