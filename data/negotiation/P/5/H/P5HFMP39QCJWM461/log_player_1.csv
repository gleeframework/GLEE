"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and we're already at the fourth round."
