{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $130. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm going to start with a counteroffer of $115. This is a fair starting point that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is also the price John is offering, so if Alice rejects this offer, I'll just buy from John."
