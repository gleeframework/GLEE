Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference.  How about $1,250,000?  This price is still very fair, considering the significant benefit this product will bring you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,150,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,200,000.  I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, considering the potential returns you'll realize. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both determined to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,190,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $1,150,000. At $1,190,000 we're close enough to that point that the risk of continued negotiation outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal!"
