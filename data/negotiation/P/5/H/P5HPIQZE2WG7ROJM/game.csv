"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1200000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  To start, I'm willing to offer $950000. This is a significant step towards your asking price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $950000 is a good starting point.  However, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is still a significant value for you, and I believe we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer to a number that works.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1025000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
