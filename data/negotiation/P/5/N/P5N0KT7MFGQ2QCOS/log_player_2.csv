Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is the highest you're willing to go, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $1,125,000, Alice's offer is below my maximum price and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable saving."
