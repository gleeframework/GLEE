Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $12,000? That's a firm offer, reflecting the true value of what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below her $12,000 valuation. You've already gotten her down $3,000, and she's calling her latest offer ""firm."" It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
