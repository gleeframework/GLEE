,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,500,000? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I believe $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
