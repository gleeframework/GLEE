"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $160 to start the negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I was hoping to spend closer to $60 for the product."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140. I think this product would be really valuable for you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $140 is still outside my budget. Would you be open to a price closer to $75? I believe that's a reasonable offer."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $120? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $120.  This is still more than your maximum budget of $80. There's no point in continuing the negotiation. You can get the product from John for a guaranteed $80, which is a better deal."
