Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about other options. If we can't meet in the middle, I might have to consider selling to someone else. What do you think?

``` 

This is the best option for Bob at this point.  Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** Her language suggests she's strongly considering other buyers. Pushing further could make her walk away.
* **Bob's price is met:**  $10,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, and Alice is now offering that price. 
* **John's price is the same:** While Bob could go to John, he won't save any money.  

Accepting the offer now ensures Bob gets the product at his target price."
