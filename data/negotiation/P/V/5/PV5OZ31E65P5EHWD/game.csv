"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you are getting closer.  How about we settle for $9,500 and call it a deal?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about other options. If we can't meet in the middle, I might have to consider selling to someone else. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
