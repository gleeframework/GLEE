"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm looking to purchase the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is below its true value and potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in purchasing this product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your persistence is admirable, and I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,050,000. Would you consider $1,075,000?  This is a significant step from my last offer and shows my serious intent to purchase. I'm hopeful we can close this deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,075,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to accept $1,090,000 as my final offer. This price is firm, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
