"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm looking to purchase the product for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is below its true value and potential.  I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,120,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in purchasing this product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving closer to my desired price. Accepting $1,100,000 now would leave potential profit on the table. It's worth making another counteroffer to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence is admirable, and I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,050,000. Would you consider $1,075,000?  This is a significant step from my last offer and shows my serious intent to purchase. I'm hopeful we can close this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is attempting to shift the negotiation back in his favor with a smaller increase.  While time is a factor, we still have room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,075,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to accept $1,090,000 as my final offer. This price is firm, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal to Bob that I'm getting close to my limit. By stating this is my final offer, I increase the pressure to close the deal.  Offering a round number like $1,090,000 might be more appealing than continuing with smaller increments."
