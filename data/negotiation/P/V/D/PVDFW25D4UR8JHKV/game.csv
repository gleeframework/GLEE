,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110. Would you consider $102.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,6,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102.50 and $115. Would you consider $108.75? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. Unfortunately, I think we've reached an impasse. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Thank you for your time and consideration.",80.0,Bob,10,
