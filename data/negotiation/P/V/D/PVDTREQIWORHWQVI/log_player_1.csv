Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation and potential for a deal that benefits both of you. 
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message indicates you're open to discussing the price, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer or counteroffer based on Bob's response. This strategy allows you to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think your product is great,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your minimum selling price of $12,000. This means selling to Bob is still a better outcome than selling to John.
* **You have room for a higher counteroffer:** Bob values the product at $15,000, and he's already offered $13,000. This means there's still room for a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price between $13,000 and $14,000. This will show Bob that you're serious about getting a price closer to your initial offer, but you're still open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little lower than I'd like. How about $13,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. This shows you're willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:** A counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to continue the discussion and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Staying above your minimum:**  $13,500 is still above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you still make a profit even if Bob accepts.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  Bob will either accept your counteroffer or propose a new counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to adjust:** Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your counteroffer further or consider selling to John if you're not satisfied with the negotiation."
