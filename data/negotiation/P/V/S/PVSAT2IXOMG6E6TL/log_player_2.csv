"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You have no idea what the product is truly worth to her.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you more information and potential to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, which will test the waters and hopefully encourage her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too early to accept. We can likely get her closer to our target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
``` 

We're increasing our offer slightly, showing Alice we're serious about buying but still pushing for a better price. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourages her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high for our target price. We have a few rounds left and should continue to negotiate. We've already demonstrated our willingness to pay a reasonable amount, and she should start coming down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

We're showing Alice we're getting closer to her price, but we're still firmly negotiating. This is a good middle ground that could potentially sway her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to our target price, but it's still too high. We've only got a few rounds left, so we need to push for a lower price. It's worth risking one more counteroffer to see if we can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

We're going to make a final push with a counteroffer that's almost halfway between our last offer and Alice's latest offer. We've shown persistence and our willingness to pay, so this might be enough to convince her to accept. If not, we'll have to make a decision about buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We've reached the penultimate round, and Alice's offer is still above our target price.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a significant risk of not reaching an agreement. Since we only have one round left, it's safer to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees we get the product and limits further risk of price fluctuations."
