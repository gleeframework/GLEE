"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential concessions.  I'm aiming for a win-win situation by not going for the full $1,200,000 right away, but still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about we set the product price at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm motivated to make a deal, I'm not desperate.  I'm going to counter with a higher price, but I'll need to be strategic in how I approach it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a significant benefit, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
