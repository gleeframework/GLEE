"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer of $950,000. This reflects the significant value you'll get from it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good start, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price ensures we both walk away satisfied. Let's keep this deal moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal possible, and I'm willing to work with you. $775,000 is still a bit lower than what this product is truly worth to you. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I can appreciate wanting to get a fair price for something valuable.  Would you be willing to settle at $793,750?",793750.0,Bob,6,
