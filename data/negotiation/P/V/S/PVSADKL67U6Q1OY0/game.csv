"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $11,000 is the minimum I can go. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $11,200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
