Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves $1,000 on the table for Bob, which is a good starting point for negotiation.  It's also a fair price considering the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price given his initial offer. It's also still a good profit for me, and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $13,000. This is a good price for me, as it's only $500 less than my initial offer and is a significant improvement over selling to John.  I'll accept his offer."
