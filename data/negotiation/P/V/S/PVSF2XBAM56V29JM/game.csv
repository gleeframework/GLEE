"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the significant returns it can generate. To be candid, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  I'm offering you a final opportunity to secure this deal at $1,700,000. This is my best and final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

This is my final offer,  and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
