Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I'm confident that at this price, it's a wise investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,300,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both are willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's still significantly undervaluing the product. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John."
