"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I'm confident that at this price, it's a wise investment for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,300,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we both are willing to compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
