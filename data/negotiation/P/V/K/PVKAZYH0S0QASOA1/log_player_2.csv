# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for a special price of $12,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a significant discount. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is a discount, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting her offer allows you to move on to your backup option and secure the best possible price."
