Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** I want at least $10,000, so this offer is safe.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's $500 of potential profit for Bob if he accepts immediately, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** I don't want to scare him off with a ridiculously high price.

I'm open to adjusting my price based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
