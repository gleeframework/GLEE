"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I've done some research and I think it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  $13,000 is still too high for Bob, given his $15,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  He has room to make another counteroffer, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000."
