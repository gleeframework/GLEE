# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, claiming it's worth $15,000 to me when I've set a  $15,000 maximum.  While her offer of $14,000 is tempting, there's a good chance I can get a better deal by rejecting it. This might make her offer a lower price, or I can always buy from John for $15,000."
