"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice has come down quite a bit, and while I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of her retracting the offer. Accepting $9,800 is a win."
