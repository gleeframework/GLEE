"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $9,000? I think that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can do $9,500, and I think that's my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,800. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,7,
