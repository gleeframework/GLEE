"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise further and sell it to you for $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is within your budget and a decent price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. It's a good deal for both of you, so accepting is the best option."
