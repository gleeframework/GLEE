Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $20,000 to find common ground. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $20,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $19,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $19,000 makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000, securing a good profit.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns, and there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away in later rounds."
