"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price point, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I want to explore if Bob is willing to compromise further before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves significant value for you, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum desired price of $800,000,  I believe I can still push for a higher amount, given Bob's clear interest in the product. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is close to my minimum desired price of $800,000, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still confident I can push for a higher price, especially considering that we only have 4 rounds left before I have to consider selling to John. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,015,000? This price is a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1015000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,015,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,015,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $990,000? I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $990,000 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're only two rounds away from my default sale to John for $800,000. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $995,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $985,000 is slightly lower than I hoped for, it's a better offer than what John is offering. With only one round left, I don't have time to negotiate further and risk losing out on the sale altogether. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
