"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $140?  That would be a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $140 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to make this work, but I need to get a bit more for it.  How about $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'd be willing to meet you at $115. That's as high as I'm willing to go.,115.0,Bob,6,
