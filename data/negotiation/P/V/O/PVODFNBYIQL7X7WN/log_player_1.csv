Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  However, I'm aware he might reject the offer, and I'm prepared to counter if needed or sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $75?  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for a product you value at $80."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $72 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $72 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $80. Since John is willing to pay that amount, it's a safer option to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
