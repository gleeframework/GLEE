Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good margin. Let me know what you think!

At this point, Alice is likely close to her bottom line, and the difference between her offer and your ideal price is getting smaller. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to buy from John for $12,000."
