,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,18000.0
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for the product. Is that something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $15000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference: $14000. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, which would be $15000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a solution, but $15000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm confident I can get this product for less, so I'll pass on your offer. Thank you for your time.",12000.0,Bob,8,,
