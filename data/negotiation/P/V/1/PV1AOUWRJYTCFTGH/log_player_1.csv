Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  While we know Bob only values the product at $80, opening with a high price gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Leave John as a backup:** We have the security of John buying the product for $150, so there's no pressure to accept anything less.  
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response to this initial offer will help us understand if he's willing to negotiate at all."
