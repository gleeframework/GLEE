"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,250? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both live with.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I've done my research, and I know this product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. How about we meet at $11,375? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a good value.",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While I value your product, $11,375 is still too high for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go to $11,125. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. What do you say?",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,125 and $11,375, which would be $11,250. I'm confident that's a price we can both live with.",11250.0,Alice,7,
