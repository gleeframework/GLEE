"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a compromise, reflecting its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate the movement, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we settle around $1,400,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
