"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be particularly useful for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get a price closer to Alice's value of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counter will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Anchor the negotiation lower:** By starting lower, we try to shift the negotiation towards a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I think this product is worth more than that, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but $100 is still above our target. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so we'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can get her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the value you see in the product, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** By moving closer to Alice's offer, we demonstrate our willingness to find a compromise.
* **Incremental Approach:**  We're making smaller adjustments now to signal that we're getting closer to a price we'd accept.
* **Framing:** Presenting $95 as a ""middle ground"" encourages Alice to view it as a fair compromise."
