{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price. I'm also being friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 150}
