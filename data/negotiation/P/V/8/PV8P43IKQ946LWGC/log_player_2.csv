Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Alice is coming closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer. I'll try another counter-offer in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting closer to the price you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to offer the product for $6,900. This is a compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'd accept. However, I think with a little more negotiation, I can get her to come down another $100-$200. I'll try one more counter-offer before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $6,700?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product for $6,850. This is my final compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer secures a good deal at $6,850, saving me $1,150 compared to John's offer."
