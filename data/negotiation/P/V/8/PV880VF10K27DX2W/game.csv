"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
