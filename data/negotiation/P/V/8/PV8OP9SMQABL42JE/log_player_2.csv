"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Alice's offer is within that range, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Alice's motivation:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000.  This means she's likely willing to go lower than $1,150,000 to make a profit.
* **Avoiding the fallback:** By rejecting, Bob doesn't commit to Alice's price and keeps the option of potentially getting a better deal. 

**Next steps:** Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's $1,150,000 but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. 
* **Testing the waters:** Bob wants to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A counteroffer at $1,050,000 is a strong starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can increase his counteroffer slightly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better deal than her previous offer, it's still not the best possible price. 

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Room for compromise:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and Bob has a budget that allows him to continue the process.

**Next steps:** Bob should make another counteroffer. A good counteroffer would be something like $1,075,000, which is still a good profit for Alice but brings the price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer ($1,050,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,100,000). 
* **Signaling willingness to compromise:** It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway.
* **Strategic positioning:**  If Alice rejects, Bob can increase his offer slightly in the next round, but he wants to keep his counteroffers close to his target price to maximize savings."
