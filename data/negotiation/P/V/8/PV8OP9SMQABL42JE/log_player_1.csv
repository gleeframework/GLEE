Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price if he's truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer but higher than John's offer.  I will reject it and send a counteroffer, hoping to close the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to demonstrate flexibility, but still staying above Bob's offer. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a price point that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's latest offer is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer.  While it's still below my ideal price,  it's worth accepting. I've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially since John's offer is lower.  It's better to secure a slightly lower profit than risk getting nothing at all."
