"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a significant return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a cheaper price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you'll make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for you. Buying from John would cost you $1,500,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000."
