"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you'll make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
