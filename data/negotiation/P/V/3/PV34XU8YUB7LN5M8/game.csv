"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the initial price, it's a bit lower than I anticipated.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go that high. Considering our initial conversation and the value the product brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going that high. Considering the value the product brings and the market demand, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a price of $875,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",890000.0,Bob,6,
