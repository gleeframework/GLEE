"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, his offer is still below it.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, hoping to secure a higher price. Selling to John right now guarantees me $1,000,000, but I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $975,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially failing."
