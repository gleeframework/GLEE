"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $2,300,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and the returns you can expect.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still outside my acceptable range.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product,  which I believe reflects a fair compromise.  This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
