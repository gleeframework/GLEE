Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, but still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer.  If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $12,500. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and it's closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
