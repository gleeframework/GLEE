Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a solid value for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the ""win-win"" potential of the deal for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I can move on to John, who offers the full $1,500,000. 

This strategy balances maximizing my potential earnings with the need to secure a sale quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I am going to reject his offer and attempt to counteroffer.  Even though selling to John would be the most profitable choice, I want to explore whether I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. This reflects the value of the product and leaves you some room for profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints to maintain a positive relationship.
* **Counteroffering with a Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price of $1,100,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open for Discussion:**  I leave the door open for further negotiations, hoping to find a mutually acceptable price. 

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to signal my willingness to compromise while still securing a price that's closer to my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob has come up slightly in his offer, $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counteroffer once more.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before I resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still not in my price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  and propose $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value of the product while being more realistic for your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise that splits the difference between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000).
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I emphasize finding a solution that benefits both parties. 

By offering a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer but still above his budget, I'm hoping to show my willingness to negotiate while also making a final attempt to secure a price closer to my minimum target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price for the product and would like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up in his offer again, $975,000 is still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiations are unlikely to bring Bob much closer to my desired price.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale with John, who is willing to pay my full asking price."
