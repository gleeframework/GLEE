"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a solid value for you.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. This reflects the value of the product and leaves you some room for profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would like to make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still not in my price range. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  and propose $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value of the product while being more realistic for your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price for the product and would like to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
