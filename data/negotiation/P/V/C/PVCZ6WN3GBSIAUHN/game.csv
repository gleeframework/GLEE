"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to go to $13,000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
