Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be gained.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about your deal with John, and you don't know his maximum willingness to pay.

**Strategy:**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Aiming too high risks losing him to a competitor or causing him to walk away.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear, concise, and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit ($150,000 above your minimum) while still offering Bob a compelling discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Call to Action:** Ending with ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly higher to leave room for bargaining.
* **Market Context:** Factors like supply and demand in the market for similar products could influence your asking price.

This offer provides a strong starting point for negotiations with Bob."
