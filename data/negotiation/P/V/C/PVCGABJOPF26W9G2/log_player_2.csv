# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's worth every penny and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so don't miss out! Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her maximum price. There's no room for negotiation. You can achieve your goal of buying the product while saving money by rejecting her offer. You'll then buy from John at the same price, effectively making Alice and John compete, even if indirectly."
