"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $750,000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to lower the price even more, especially since she rejected my counteroffer in the previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $800,000.  This price point is fair for both of us, considering the market value and the potential of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and her offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my target price.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer, as it's within a reasonable range and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I have the option of buying from John for $1,200,000, making this offer a significant savings."
