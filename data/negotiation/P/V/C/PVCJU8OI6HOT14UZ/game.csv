"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $750,000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $800,000.  This price point is fair for both of us, considering the market value and the potential of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this point.",825000.0,Alice,5,
