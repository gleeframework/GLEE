Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $750,000.  This reflects my understanding of the market value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's discuss further and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only comfortable going up to $800,000.  This price point is fair for both of us, considering the market value and the potential of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties.
