Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price of $80, but still lower than what the product is worth to him. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate a better price, while also allowing me to potentially earn a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the product's value."
