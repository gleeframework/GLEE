"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love.  I'm starting the price at $140, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $110 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $120.  It's a good price for both of us, and avoids us having to go back and forth any more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a great deal for me.  While I could sell to John for the same price, there's no point in risking that Bob might change his mind in the next round.   $120 is my minimum, so it's a win for me!"
