Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still within my budget and offers a fair value for both of us.

Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

While $875,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $900,000. Let's compromise at $890,000.

Bob's offer of $885,000 is close enough to my desired price. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial target, I'm getting a better return than selling to John and we have limited rounds left.  It's time to accept this offer and close the deal."
