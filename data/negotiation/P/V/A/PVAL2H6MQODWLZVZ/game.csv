,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $100.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $125. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,5,
