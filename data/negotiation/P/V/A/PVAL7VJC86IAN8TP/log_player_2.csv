"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **There's potential to save money.** By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to secure a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can still buy the product from John, but it will cost you more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my maximum and Alice's initial offer, giving us both room to compromise.
* **Alice's perspective:** This counteroffer is still profitable for her (she's willing to sell for $1,200,000) while giving her an incentive to negotiate further.
* **My perspective:** This offer is within my budget and gives me a good chance to save money compared to Alice's initial price or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to my desired price:**  Her counteroffer of $1,280,000 is only $30,000 higher than my counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation might not yield significant savings:**  There's a chance that another round of negotiation might bring the price down further, but it's not guaranteed.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting, Alice might get frustrated and walk away.  
* **Cost of John's offer:**  Buying from John would cost me $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Alice's current offer. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
