Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.

I'm not comfortable selling the product for $13,500. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer Bob again, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, which is just $500 above your previous offer. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

This time, I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's still below my initial target, it's only $500 below my last counteroffer, and close to what I'm willing to accept. It's better to close the deal and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
