"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit, but I also need to be mindful of Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while showing flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and John's offer. I'm accepting this offer because I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing."
