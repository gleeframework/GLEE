"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested, but I'm not sure I can justify $900000 at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $750000?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I could make good use of this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $825000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $800000.  This is a strong price, and I believe it's fair given the value we've discussed.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm also willing to consider one more counteroffer from you. If you're serious about the product, I'd like to hear a revised offer from you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. I'm very keen on this product and believe $810000 is a fair compromise, reflecting the value we've discussed. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I can see that you're serious about the product. However, I'm still not convinced that $810000 is enough. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
