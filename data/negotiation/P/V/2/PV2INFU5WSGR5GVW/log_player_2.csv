"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for negotiation.**  $900,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price, but I can likely get it lower.
* **I need to assess Alice's motivation.**  Why is she willing to sell at this price? Is she desperate?  
* **Counteroffering allows me to gain information.** By rejecting and counteroffering, I can see if Alice is willing to budge and gauge how low she's willing to go."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still good, but there's more room to negotiate.**  $825,000 is a good price, but I'm still aiming to get a lower price.
* **Alice is clearly motivated to sell.**  She's already adjusted her price, which suggests she's willing to negotiate further.
* **I want to see how much more she's willing to drop.**  By rejecting and counteroffering, I can potentially get a better price."

# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly motivated to sell.** She's stuck at $825,000 and is willing to entertain one more counteroffer.
* **There's still a chance to get a better price.**  She's already moved closer to my offer, suggesting she's not completely firm on $825,000. 
* **I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer.**  If she doesn't budge, I can always go to John, but I think I can squeeze out a little more savings."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm on $825,000.**  She's made it clear this is her bottom line.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.**  She's already made concessions, and I've made my final offer.
* **Accepting the offer is the best option.**  $825,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's price, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
