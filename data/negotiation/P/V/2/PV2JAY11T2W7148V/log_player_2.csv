"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $900,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a good strategy to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation, but also to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she rejects this offer,  Bob can increase his counteroffer slightly in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $850,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there is still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $750,000 is still a good deal for him, as it's well below his maximum budget, and it's likely Alice will be motivated to accept with the pressure of the limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is running out of time.  He has already made several counteroffers and it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower than $800,000.  Accepting $825,000 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him over $675,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a calculated risk, but with only 5 rounds left, it's likely the best option to secure the product."
