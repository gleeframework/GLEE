Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he values the product enough to meet me somewhere in the middle. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll use the next round to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and close the deal. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too low for me. I've already compromised a lot and I don't think he'll budge further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  At least I'm guaranteed to make a profit and avoid any further negotiations."
