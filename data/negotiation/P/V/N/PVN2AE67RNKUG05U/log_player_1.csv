"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm aiming for a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high ($1,200,000) establishes a strong position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces the high asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message doesn't sound like an ultimatum, leaving space for Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable offer. Considering its value, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below my initial ask. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and signals I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to risk not reaching a deal with Bob to try and secure a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident that the product's value warrants a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've lowered my asking price by $150,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $1,050,000 is a compromise between my initial ask and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The language still emphasizes the product's value to justify a price above $1,000,000.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price point while still striving for a significant profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  A $50,000 increase shows he's willing to move, and I need to demonstrate the same. I'll aim for a price above $1,000,000 in the next round.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds since John's offer is a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm also willing to move, let's settle on $1,025,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  A $25,000 decrease from my last offer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Firm but Fair:** By maintaining a price above $1,000,000, I'm signaling that I'm serious about this valuation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution, which could encourage Bob to make a decision sooner rather than later. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a significant profit and potentially closing the deal before Bob loses interest or I need to rely on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $975,000. Can we consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be pragmatic.  While $975,000 is slightly below my ideal price, it's a strong offer and represents a significant profit.  Continuing to push for a higher amount risks:

* **Stalemate:** Bob seems committed to a price range below $1,000,000.
* **Losing the Deal:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations, and further rejections could lead Bob to walk away.

Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
