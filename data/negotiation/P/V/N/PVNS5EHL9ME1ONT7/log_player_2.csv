"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's worth more than that to you, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $140 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150."
