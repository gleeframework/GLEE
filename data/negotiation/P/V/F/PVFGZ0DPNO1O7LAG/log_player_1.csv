Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $142.50?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $142.50 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $125.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $125 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your patience with me. I can do $130. It seems like we are getting closer! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while we're getting closer, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $150.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm not willing to risk getting a lower price with Bob."
