"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable item at a discounted price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting at a price lower than her value, but there's a good chance we can get it even lower with a counteroffer. We're still early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($90) than Alice's initial offer ($110). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below $120. 
* **Polite and interested:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation. We express interest in the product but clearly state our budget limitations. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** Offering $90 doesn't lock us into that price. It signals our desired range and allows Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle and offer the product for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we still have room to negotiate. A $10 difference is significant, and we're only on round 3. Let's try to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $100 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Would you be willing to go down to $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:** We're moving in smaller increments now ($5) to show Alice we're serious about the negotiation but still seeking a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:** By offering $95, we're aiming for a price point between our initial offer ($90) and Alice's counteroffer ($100). This helps gauge her flexibility. 
* **Maintaining positivity:** We continue to express appreciation for the negotiation process and keep the tone collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $97 as a compromise. This still allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $97 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and only $3 more than our target price.
* **Time constraint:** We're over halfway through the rounds. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result and could risk reaching an impasse. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While we could potentially get the price lower, the difference is small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  

It's better to secure a good price now than potentially miss out on the discount entirely."
