Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 if you could accommodate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $90 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I've already made several concessions, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Rather than risk getting stuck with a price lower than my floor, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
