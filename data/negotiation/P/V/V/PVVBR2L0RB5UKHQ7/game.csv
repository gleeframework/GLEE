"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $130, but I was thinking more along the lines of $142.50. It's a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $136? I believe this is a fair price considering both our desired outcomes.",136.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another compromise, and I'll meet you at $138. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",138.0,Alice,5,
