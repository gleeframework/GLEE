{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob might scare him off. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a significant profit margin for Alice. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a substantial gain if he accepts outright.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster."
