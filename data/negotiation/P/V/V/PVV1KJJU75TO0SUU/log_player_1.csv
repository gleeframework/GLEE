Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable, for $14,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that perfectly suits your needs."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($1,000) while securing a substantial profit ($4,000) for you.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum selling price if Bob declines.

This approach aims for a win-win scenario â€“  a good deal for Bob and a profitable sale for you."
