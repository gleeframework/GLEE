{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate downwards. However, it's still a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're comfortable with this price as it's higher than your $1,500,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can lower the price if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **It shows confidence:**  A high initial offer can make Bob think the product is worth a lot, motivating him to negotiate. 

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible. You'll be evaluating Bob's responses and adjusting your strategy as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I am only willing to pay up to $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, rejecting it for now makes strategic sense.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting, you show Bob that you are not desperate for a sale at his price. This can make him reconsider and potentially offer a higher price.
* **Exploring Higher Value:**  There's a chance Bob might value the product higher than $1,500,000 but is testing the waters with a low offer. A counteroffer from you might reveal his true valuation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to craft a counteroffer. Consider the following:

* **Counteroffer Amount:**  Start with a counteroffer higher than $1,500,000 but lower than your initial $2,000,000 offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate, but still see value in the product.  
* **Justification:**  Explain your counteroffer in a way that emphasizes the product's unique value, highlighting potential benefits for Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reviewed your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still not able to meet at $1750000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1600000. I hope this is within the range that would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,600,000 is still less than your initial asking price, it's within a reasonable range and above your minimum. 

* **Close to Your Goal:** This offer is closer to your initial target of $2,000,000, and it's a good compromise considering Bob's initial low offer.
* **Avoiding Further Delays:**  Continuing to negotiate could result in further rejections and potentially lower offers from Bob.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, but it's not clear if Bob will eventually agree to a higher price. This offer offers a relatively safe way to secure a decent profit. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you have a deadline or a pressing need to sell the product, accepting this offer could be the best option. 
* **Future Potential:**  If you believe Bob might offer a higher price in the future, you could choose to reject and continue negotiating.  However, this carries the risk of a lower offer or him withdrawing entirely."
