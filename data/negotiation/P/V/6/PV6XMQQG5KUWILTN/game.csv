"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1500000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Considering its unique features and potential for growth, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This compromise shows my commitment to a fair deal, and I believe it still represents excellent value for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I've reviewed your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still not able to meet at $1750000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1600000. I hope this is within the range that would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
