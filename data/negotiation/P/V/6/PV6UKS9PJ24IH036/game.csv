"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a product that's worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product you want.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm afraid I can't meet that.  My absolute highest would be $775,000. If that doesn't work for you, I understand.",775000.0,Bob,6,
