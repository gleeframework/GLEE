"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still pushing it for me. I could do $700,000. That's a substantial offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is still not close to the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
