# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $900,000 is too far below what I can accept. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than reasonable. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge much further from her $1,600,000 offer.  While she might come down a little, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a significant saving and avoids potentially overpaying."
