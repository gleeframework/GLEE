"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you considering my offer, but $1,750,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $900,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $900,000 is too far below what I can accept. If you're serious, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than reasonable. Let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
