"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 maximum and even exceeds what she values it at. You have a lot of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer considerably lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal.
* **Aiming for Under Value:** While you'd be happy to pay up to $8,000, aiming for a price well below her $12,000 valuation increases the chances of getting closer to your ideal price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for a back-and-forth discussion.  Alice is likely to counter, giving you more information about her acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $11,000 is still above both your target price and John's offer. You can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Strategically:** You're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate by increasing your offer. However, you're not jumping too high too quickly.
* **Staying Below Your Limit:** The offer of $7,500 keeps you below your $8,000 maximum, leaving some room for a potential final concession.
* **Testing Her Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go. If she rejects it outright, you know you might need to get closer to $8,000 or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  $9,000 is my final offer, and I think it's a very reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $9,000 is her final offer. While this is closer to your budget, it's still above the $8,000 you can get the product for from John.  At this point, continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better price from Alice.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
