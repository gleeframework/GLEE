Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate down.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate up if needed. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $140 is a good middle ground between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  By rejecting his offer, I can maintain my negotiating position and potentially push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). 
* **Maintaining a higher price:** While I'm willing to come down, I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price point of $150.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm open to negotiating, Bob's repeated insistence on $130 indicates he's unlikely to budge further. This price is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees I achieve my desired profit and avoids further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
