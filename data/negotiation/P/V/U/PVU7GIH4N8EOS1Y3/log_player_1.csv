"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident in the true potential of this product, which goes beyond the $1,300,000 mark.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair value considering my budget and the product's potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $1,300,000.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, we still have time to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob.  We'll use the next round to see if we can incentivize him to move closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position.  Let's make this simple: $1,600,000, and I'll include [mention a valuable add-on or service related to the product]. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount and added benefit for you. "",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're making it clear this is our last offer to create a sense of urgency and show we're serious.
* **Justification:**  We're not just lowering the price, we're adding value for Bob to justify the price point. 
* **Strategic Retreat:** $1,600,000 is still a substantial profit, and we're leaving some room in case Bob wants to negotiate a tiny bit higher. 

We're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer makes the most sense, so this round is crucial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and the additional benefit is definitely a plus. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,400,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has made a substantial move from his initial offer, indicating he's serious about buying. 
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiations. While we might squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, there's a risk Bob walks away. Taking the sure profit now is the less risky option."
