"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident in the true potential of this product, which goes beyond the $1,300,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This considers both our positions while still reflecting the product's real worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking to my offer of $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair value considering my budget and the product's potential. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position.  Let's make this simple: $1,600,000, and I'll include [mention a valuable add-on or service related to the product]. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount and added benefit for you. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and the additional benefit is definitely a plus. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
