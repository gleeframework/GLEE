"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still within the negotiation phase and have room to push for a better deal. Selling to John would be the optimal outcome, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $975,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and ensures a win-win situation for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to suggest a price of $960000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $960,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room to negotiate. It's better to keep exploring the potential with Bob rather than jumping at this offer. The risk of selling to John is always there, but the potential for a better deal with Bob is too tempting to let go of now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $960,000 is still slightly below what I need to accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $965,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 965000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to move forward with a price of $962500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and are getting closer to the price I'd ideally like. However, Bob is showing a pattern of consistently offering a bit less than my counteroffers.  I'm concerned that this trend will continue, and we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my target price, ensuring I don't lose out on a better deal."
