{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for some room to negotiate while ensuring I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to try to get a better deal from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Can you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum and  a good deal for Bob considering his perceived value of the product."
