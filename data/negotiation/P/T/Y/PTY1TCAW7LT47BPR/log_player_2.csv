# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would still provide you with a significant value, and allows me to recover a reasonable price.
