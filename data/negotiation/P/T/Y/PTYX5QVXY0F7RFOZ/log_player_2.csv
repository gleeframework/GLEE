Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to let this go for $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant bargain considering the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, she's still significantly above your $1,000,000 limit. Her mentioning another buyer could be a negotiating tactic, and even if it's true, there's no guarantee she'll get that higher price. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially exceeding your budget.  John offers a sure thing at your maximum price."
