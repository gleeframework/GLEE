"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and what it can do for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. I could do $900,000.  That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my strong interest in the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a feasible price point.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. I'm willing to let this go for $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant bargain considering the product's true value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
