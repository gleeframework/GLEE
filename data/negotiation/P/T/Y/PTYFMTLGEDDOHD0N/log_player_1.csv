{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  I'm also expressing confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer you the product for $7,500. It's a fair price that's still within your budget and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $7,250 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that the price will continue to drop or the negotiations will drag on.  John is a guaranteed sale for $8,000, so it's the most sensible decision to sell to him."
