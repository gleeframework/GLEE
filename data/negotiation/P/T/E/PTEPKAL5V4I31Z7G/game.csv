"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I know it will be a valuable asset to your company. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from its true worth, but it also gives you a great opportunity to acquire something truly special.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your offer and gives you a very competitive price for this unique product. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. Let's split the difference. I'm proposing a final offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of this product.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to go higher.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the benefits it will bring to your business.  Let's close this deal. It's a win-win for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my maximum budget, Alice, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I'm not comfortable going up to $990,000. Can we meet at $985,000 and call it a day?",985000.0,Bob,8,
