Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give me valuable information for the next steps in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This price aligns with my budget and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum ($1,200,000). I have room to negotiate and will aim to meet somewhere in the middle. John's standing offer provides me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,110,000. This reflects a significant price reduction on my end while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant price reduction of $40,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Holding Ground:**  I'm not dropping to his offer price. My new price still keeps the agreement well above both his offer and my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  John's standing offer allows me to confidently hold firm on a price point that ensures a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still looking to pay closer to $1,075,000. This offer is closer to my budget and represents a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but very slowly. He only increased his offer by $25,000 from his previous offer. 
* **Profit Margin Still Significant:** While selling to John guarantees the highest profit, there's still a potential profit to be made with Bob above my $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **One Last Push:**  I'll make one more counteroffer that's closer to Bob's current price, but still maintains a reasonable profit margin for myself. If he rejects this, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price to reflect the product's full value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,090,000. This is my best price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer makes it clear to Bob that I'm nearing the end of my negotiation flexibility. 
* **Small Concession:**  I'm conceding slightly more to show good faith and potentially close the deal, but not so much that it significantly impacts my profit.
* **Walk-Away Point:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will proceed to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000.  This ensures I don't leave money on the table by chasing an increasingly unlikely deal with Bob."
