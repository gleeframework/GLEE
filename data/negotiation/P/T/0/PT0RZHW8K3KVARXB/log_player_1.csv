Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that is mutually beneficial, allowing Bob to get the product for a good price while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my previous offer of $12,000.  It's not worth selling the product at such a loss. I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for myself. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to Bob and my need to secure a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, and I'm happy to sell to John for my desired price."
