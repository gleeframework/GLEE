Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below that number. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly from his current offer.  Selling to John at $800,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
