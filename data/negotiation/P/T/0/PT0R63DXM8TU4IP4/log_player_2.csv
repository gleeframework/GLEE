"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility given the value of the product to her ($15,000). It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $14,000 is still well above my budget.  I'll continue negotiating to try and get the price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is still above my ideal price, but it's a significant step closer to my budget.  I'm pushing for a firm price and emphasizing that this is my final offer to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my budget, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  To avoid further wasted time and effort, I'll purchase the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and allows me to secure the product."
