Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth significantly more than its market value. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,150,000.  I think you'll find this to be a fair deal considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. John guarantees $1,200,000, but there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) aims to:
    * **Create Perceived Value:** The wording emphasizes the product's unique qualities and positions the price as a deal.
    * **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, there might be space to settle closer to my desired price. 

**If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John at my minimum price, ensuring no loss.**"
