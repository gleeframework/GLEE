"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's a significant discount from your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $900,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling this is his best offer. Accepting $875,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and there's always the risk he walks away entirely if I counter again."
