Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 leaves some room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to his perceived value.
* **Considering John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $100 provides a safety net. You don't want to go below this price, but it gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to your desired price range. While $110 is a decent offer, it's still below what you aimed for. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open, and you can try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle at $112.50?"", 
""product_price"": 112.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This classic negotiation tactic can signal fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price point is still a good profit margin for you, above your $100 minimum and John's offer.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  By countering, you're gauging how firm Bob is on his $110 offer. He might accept, or this could lead to further negotiation where you might secure a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $109? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $109. It's unlikely Bob will suddenly agree to $112.50 or higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Your time is valuable.  The longer you negotiate with Bob, the longer you miss out on potentially selling to other buyers or focusing on other tasks.
* **Profitable Deal:**  $109 is still a $9 profit over your minimum and John's offer. It's a reasonable compromise to make a sale and move on."
