"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and would make this deal work for both of us.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  I'm getting closer to my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's get this done!",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $9,875.  This is a small adjustment that would make the deal very close to being done. I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",9875.0,Bob,8,
