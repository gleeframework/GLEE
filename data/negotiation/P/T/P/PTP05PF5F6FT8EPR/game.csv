"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1200000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000, considering the product's potential value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. Let's try $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer, it's still beyond my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This price reflects my genuine interest and recognizes the value you're seeking.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which would be $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1000000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer $950000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this price.  Let's finalize this and avoid further negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1100000, which would be $1025000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
