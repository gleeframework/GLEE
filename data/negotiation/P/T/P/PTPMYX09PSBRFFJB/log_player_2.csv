"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by myself. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Given its value to me and the market, I'm offering it to you at $95. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable item at a price slightly above its perceived worth by others but well below my personal valuation. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
