Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $14,000 is too low for me. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Bob's offer is exactly what I'd get from John, so I'll take it and close the deal."
