Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $180.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a limited budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $75?

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $160 is still more than I can spend. I could do $80, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, he is very unlikely to reach a price that is significantly better than what John is offering. It's time to cut your losses and make the guaranteed sale to John."
