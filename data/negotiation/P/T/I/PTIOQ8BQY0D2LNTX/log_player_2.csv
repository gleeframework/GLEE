Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is a good price point, it's not quite in line with the value I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm confident this deal will still be mutually beneficial. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price allows me to make a good profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer.
