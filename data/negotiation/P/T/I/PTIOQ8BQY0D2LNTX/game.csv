"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is a good price point, it's not quite in line with the value I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm confident this deal will still be mutually beneficial. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This price allows me to make a good profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,025,000? This price seems more reasonable to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
