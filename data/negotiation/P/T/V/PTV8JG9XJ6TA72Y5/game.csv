"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle of our original offer. How about we meet at $700,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value, Alice. While I agree it's a good product, $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we possibly settle on $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $650,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",650000.0,Alice,5,
