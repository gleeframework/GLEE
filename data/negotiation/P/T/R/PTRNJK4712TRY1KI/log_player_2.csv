# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price that represents exceptional value.  Knowing your business acumen, I believe you'll recognize the significant potential it holds. I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling.  Let's discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a potential counter-offer at a lower price. It's always best to try to negotiate a better deal."
