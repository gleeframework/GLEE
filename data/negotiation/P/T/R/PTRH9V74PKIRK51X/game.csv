"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $14,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,500. I'll meet you at $15,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get closer to my target price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
