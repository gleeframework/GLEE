Bob has a few options here, but it's best to go with John. 

* **Accepting Alice's offer:** This would cost Bob $15,500, which is more than his target.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This risks a protracted negotiation.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, so there's no guarantee of a better deal. 
* **Buying from John:** This is the best option. It's within Bob's budget, and he knows he'll get a good deal. 

Bob's primary goal is to save money, and buying from John ensures that."
