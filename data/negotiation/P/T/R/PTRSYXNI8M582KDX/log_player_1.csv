{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario where I earn more than my minimum and Bob gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $150 for it. If you're open to this price, I'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
