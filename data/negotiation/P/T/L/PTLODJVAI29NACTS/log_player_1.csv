Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's value.  Let me know what you think.
