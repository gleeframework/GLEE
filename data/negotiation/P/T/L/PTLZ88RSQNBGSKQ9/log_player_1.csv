{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired outcome. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to your desired outcome, you can likely still get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a specific number:** This avoids a back-and-forth of ""too low"" and ""too high"".
* **Split the difference:** This is a common and fair negotiation tactic, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Highlight the benefit for Bob:**  Emphasizing that it's still a good deal for him can increase his likelihood of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go as high as $112.50. How about we meet in the middle at $111? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $111 is only $1.50 less than your previous counteroffer.  It's a reasonable compromise, and it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes your profit."
