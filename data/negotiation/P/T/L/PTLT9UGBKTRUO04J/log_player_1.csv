Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, aiming for a price closer to that figure maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying comfortably above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John, selling to Bob quickly at a good price might be preferable.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
