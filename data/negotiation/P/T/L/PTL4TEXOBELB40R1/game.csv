"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
