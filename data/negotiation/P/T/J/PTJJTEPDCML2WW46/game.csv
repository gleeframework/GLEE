"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $14,000.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $12,500, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $12,750.  This would be a great price for both of us and would allow us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I can only stretch to $12,500 if you're willing to throw in some extras or concessions. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,6,
