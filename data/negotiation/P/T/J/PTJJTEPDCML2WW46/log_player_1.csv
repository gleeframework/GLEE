{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Bob's Value:** Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, $14,000 is a fair price that he might be willing to accept, especially if he believes the product is worth more to him.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for counteroffers, keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $11,500 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even lower than my first offer. Accepting would be a huge loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price than $11,500.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is my backup plan, and I can always choose that option if I'm not satisfied with Bob's counteroffers. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open, and I can try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Value Proposition:** $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget, and it's less than what he would likely pay elsewhere.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Even at $13,000, I'm still above my minimum value of $15,000. This allows for further negotiation if needed, and I can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000. 

I'm confident that $13,000 is a fair and reasonable price that Bob will be happy to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $12,500 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, it's still significantly below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Power:** I've already lowered my price twice and am still close to my minimum.  I have room to negotiate further, and Bob has shown his willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is a safe fallback option, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. 

I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob if I continue to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a price closer to $13,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $12,500, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, at $12,750.  This would be a great price for both of us and would allow us to come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By offering $12,750, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise further. It's a smaller step down from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Fair Price:** $12,750 is still a good price for me. It's closer to my minimum value of $15,000 and leaves me with a reasonable profit. 
* **Final Offer:** This could be my final offer before I consider accepting Bob's offer or moving on to John. It gives Bob a clear understanding of my bottom line. 

I believe that $12,750 is a fair and reasonable price that Bob might be willing to accept, especially considering that he has already raised his offer twice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I can only stretch to $12,500 if you're willing to throw in some extras or concessions. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Standstill:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is  close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price. He's also asking for extras or concessions, suggesting he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $15,000 without any additional conditions. This is a much better deal for me. 
* **Time and Energy:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely require further concessions from me and could take more time.  

While $12,500 is not a terrible offer, the potential for additional costs and the uncertainty of future negotiations make selling to John the more attractive option."
