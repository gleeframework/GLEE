"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but let's start the discussion at $120. Looking forward to your response!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. I would like to offer the product to you for $105, which is still above your initial offer but closer to what I believe the value of the product is. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,4,
