"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be acquiring a valuable asset at a significantly lower price than its true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1000000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and it leaves some room for negotiation. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this amount.",950000.0,Bob,4,
