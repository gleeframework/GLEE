"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be acquiring a valuable asset at a significantly lower price than its true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further, but if Alice won't budge, he can always buy the product from John."
