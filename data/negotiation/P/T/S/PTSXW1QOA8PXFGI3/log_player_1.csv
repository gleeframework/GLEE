Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""limited time,"" ""great deal,"" ""quality"") might make the price more palatable.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he immediately rejects it, we know he's probably price-sensitive and we can adjust downwards. If he counters, we know he's seriously considering it.

**Important:**  

Since we have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, there's no risk in starting high with Bob.  We want to maximize our profit!"
