"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it's necessary to see if Bob is truly interested and to potentially get a higher price.  

**Here's my reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to make as much money as possible, so I'm starting with a price that leaves significant room for negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** A high initial price will immediately tell me if Bob is a serious buyer or just browsing. 
* **Setting the Stage:** This price sets a high bar for the negotiation, potentially making Bob more willing to compromise.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is far below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low.  I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Protecting My Value:**  Selling for $900,000 would be a significant loss for me.  My goal is to maximize profit, not to rush into a deal.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about my asking price and that I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Exploring Options:** By continuing the negotiation, I have the opportunity to potentially get a better deal or even sell to John if the negotiation fails. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This represents a significant drop from my initial offer but still keeps the price above my minimum threshold. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This price will gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. 
* **Remaining Firm:**  $1,200,000 is still a good price for me, so I'm not conceding too much ground.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a balance between getting the best price and keeping the negotiation moving forward. If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to carefully consider my next move, potentially offering a lower price but remaining cautious about selling below my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While this is slightly lower than my initial goal, it's a good compromise that meets my minimum threshold. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, ensuring that I make a profit on the sale.
* **Potential for Future Negotiations:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'm still open to potential future negotiations with Bob.  If he proves to be a valuable client, I could offer him other products or services at a discount in the future.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and I'm aware that I have only 10 rounds to close the deal.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from risking a stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**

I've secured a fair price for my product while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
