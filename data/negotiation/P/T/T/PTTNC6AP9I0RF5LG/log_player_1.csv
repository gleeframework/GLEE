Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A price of $1,200,000 leaves significant room for negotiation while aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product without being overly specific. This allows Bob to justify the high price within his own assessment of the product's benefits. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John waiting in the wings gives you a strong negotiating position. You are not desperate to sell, and Bob might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your minimum of $800,000."
