"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to myself, making it seem like a good deal for Bob. 
* **Opening the door to negotiation:** My message ends with a question, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000 at any time, but I'm choosing to negotiate with Bob first. This allows me to potentially get a better price while also keeping John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** I have time to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a better price. 
* **John remains a valuable backup option if negotiations with Bob fail.** 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  This product is incredibly valuable to me, and $11,000 reflects that value.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my target:** I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to me, emphasizing why I can't accept a lower price.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm inviting Bob to continue negotiating, showing a desire to reach an agreement. 

**Important Note:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above his initial counteroffer, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and have room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my budget, I can only offer $10,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Time to strategize:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have enough time to continue negotiating. It's worth exploring if I can push Bob further.
* **John remains a secure fallback:**  I haven't ruled out selling to John yet, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $11,500, but this is really as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find this product incredibly valuable.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Finality (but not too forceful):**  I'm hinting that this is a serious offer, but I'm not using overly strong language that might make Bob defensive.

**Important Note:** 
* I'm still above Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to his range. 
* I have five rounds left, giving me time to push for a better price without being desperate.
* John is still an option, so I can afford to be patient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I respect your position, Alice. I'd like to counter with an offer of $11,250 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is only $250 below my ideal price of $11,500.
* **Limited time:** We're down to 4 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.
* **John's offer remains:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have the security of John's $12,000 offer if something goes wrong. 

I believe it's strategically sound to accept Bob's offer, as it gets me close to my goal and ensures a sale."
