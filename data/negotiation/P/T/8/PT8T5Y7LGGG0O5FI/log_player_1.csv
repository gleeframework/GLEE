{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to potentially get closer to the $100 value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70 because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell the product for less than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $70.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already decided I won't sell the product for less than $80, and accepting this offer allows me to close the deal without further negotiation."
