Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be reasonable too.  $95 is just too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
