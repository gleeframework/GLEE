Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway? Would you consider $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be reasonable too.  $95 is just too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is sticking close to her valuation and has stated this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 than risk Alice not budging further and ending up empty-handed."
