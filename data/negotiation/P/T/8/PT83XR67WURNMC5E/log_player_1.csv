"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product at that price. How about $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $115 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $125.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still less than my ideal price, it's only $10 away from my minimum, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, I might not get anything better from Bob.  I'm also running out of rounds, so I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
