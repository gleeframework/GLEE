"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we're both happy.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my best offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to look elsewhere.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
