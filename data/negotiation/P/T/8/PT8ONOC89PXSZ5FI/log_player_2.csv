"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still too high.  You want to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That way we're both happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $105 is still more than you're willing to pay right now. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better deal.  You have several rounds left and can still walk away and buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my best offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is still a bit more than your ideal price, but it's within your budget and a decent deal. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price. At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option to secure the product while staying within your budget."
