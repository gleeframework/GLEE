You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's not a good deal to buy for $11,000 when you can get it for $10,000 from John. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll go with John's offer and get the product for $10,000."
