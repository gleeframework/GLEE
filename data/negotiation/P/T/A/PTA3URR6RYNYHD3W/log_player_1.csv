This offer sets a starting point above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit.  It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest and opens the door for further conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
