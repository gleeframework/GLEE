"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a relatively high price, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a little bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, $160 is still above my minimum and a good deal considering we have limited rounds. I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale."
