"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While the product is valuable, $1,300,000 is significantly more than what it's worth to Alice. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation, as there's a significant gap between Alice's offer and your maximum budget.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John would be a last resort as it's the most expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, considering its value to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down, $1,150,000 is still more than what I'm comfortable with. 
* **Further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price if I continue.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still a last resort, as I'm aiming for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still above my comfort zone. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still a last resort, as my goal is to get the best deal possible."
