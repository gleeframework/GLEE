"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $77.50? That's my final offer",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this sale.",82.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I was originally willing to pay. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider buying from someone else",80.0,Bob,6,
