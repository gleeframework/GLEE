"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $8500? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
