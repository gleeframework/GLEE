Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and shows you value the product. 
* **Not Too High:** While Bob values the product highly, an outrageous initial price might make him walk away immediately.
* **Justification:**  Explaining the value and potential return on investment can make the price more palatable and encourage Bob to engage in negotiations.
* **Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so there's less pressure to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
