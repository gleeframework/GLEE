{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping to leverage his interest in the product and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate! $115 is closer, but I was hoping to spend around $105.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  To ensure I meet my minimum goal, I'll choose to sell to John for $120.  This guarantees I get the best possible price within my constraints."
