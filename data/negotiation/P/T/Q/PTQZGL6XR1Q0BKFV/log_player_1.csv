Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about purchasing the product and gauge his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I am willing to negotiate but still value the product above his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than my minimum and a decent increase from his initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing him and having to settle for John's $15,000 offer."
