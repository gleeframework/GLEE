"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is the lowest I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $105, so how about we try $107.50? I'm really interested in making a deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me.  Let's compromise - how about $110? That's just a small adjustment from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",108.0,Bob,6,
