"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and allows you to make a good profit.  Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
