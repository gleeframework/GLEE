Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
