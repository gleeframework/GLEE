Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

This offer is a bit less than what John would pay, but it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he would save $1,000 compared to buying from John. However, it also allows you to gain a significant amount of money, as you would still earn $1,000 more than your minimum value."
