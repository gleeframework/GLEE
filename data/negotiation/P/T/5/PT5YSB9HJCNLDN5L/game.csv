"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,175,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
