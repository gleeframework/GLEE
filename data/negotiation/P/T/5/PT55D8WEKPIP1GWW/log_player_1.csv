Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $7,000 is more than my minimum, it's still below what I want to earn. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $7,000, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still leaves me a decent margin, and I think it's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

``` 

While I'd like to close the deal, $7,500 is still below my desired minimum. I'll counteroffer again, but if this fails, I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're eager to get a deal, and I want to find common ground.  Let's split the difference.  $8,000 is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll need to consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still thinking $7,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I think we can do better than that. Can you consider $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn, and while $7,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I've made several concessions already. To avoid risking further negotiation, I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him for $8,000."
