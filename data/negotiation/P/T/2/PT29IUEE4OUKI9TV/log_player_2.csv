{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget.  It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the absolute lowest I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is offering.  This sets a firm baseline and lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to risk negotiating further. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down even more, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. $1,250,000 is still within my budget and feels like a reasonable middle ground. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
