I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a limited budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to meet that price. Would $15000 be acceptable to you?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to meet at least $19000 to make it worth my while. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I believe $17000 would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this is within your range.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $19000, which would be $18000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",18000.0,Alice,7,
