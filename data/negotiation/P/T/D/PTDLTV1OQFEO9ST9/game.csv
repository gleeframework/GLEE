"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for it, since that's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $105 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my absolute maximum.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $95, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
