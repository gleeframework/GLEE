"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I believe I can offer a fair price of $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price. I have 8 rounds left and there's a good chance I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John right now would be giving up potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest, but I'm looking for a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth it!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 unless there is a very strong chance he'll accept a higher price. I'm willing to risk one more round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit on your offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still aiming for $9,750.  Let's see if we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I have 4 rounds left, and John is waiting to buy the product for $12,000, giving me a strong backup option.  I'm willing to risk one more round to try and secure a better deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if I can't get closer to my goal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  How about $9,700?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you, and I'm willing to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering our past negotiations, I am now offering $9675 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,675. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,675
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are down to the last two rounds with Bob.  His offers are inching closer but still below my minimum desired price. John is waiting to buy the product for $12,000, guaranteeing me my minimum.  There is a strong possibility that Bob won't accept a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, and I risk losing valuable time and potentially the sale to John.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed $12,000 profit, which is my minimum target."
