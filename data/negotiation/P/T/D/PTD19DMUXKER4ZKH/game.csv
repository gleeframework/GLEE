"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll love the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $120. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $145? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $135. I think this price is a good balance for both of us, and I'm still eager to buy the product.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $145 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $140? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",140.0,Alice,5,
