Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum, but it's still a good deal for Bob. It allows for some room for negotiation, while also ensuring you're not giving the product away too cheaply.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is fair and we can finalize a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can find another buyer later if I'm really unhappy with this deal, but I'd rather not lose the time and effort of negotiating with John."
