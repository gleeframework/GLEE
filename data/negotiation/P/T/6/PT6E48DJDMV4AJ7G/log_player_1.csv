Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob is still negotiating significantly above our safety net price with John.  We need to counter firmly but keep him engaged."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose $890,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000.

Bob is very consistently attempting to meet in the middle, and we're running out of rounds to make a significant jump.  Taking the $890,000 is a very good deal and ensures we don't lose him as a buyer."
