{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,200,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage in negotiations."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** I'm offering Alice the minimum she's willing to accept, which is $1,000,000. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to push for a good deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further.  
* **Plenty of room for compromise:** If Alice rejects this offer, I still have 8 rounds to find a mutually acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **There's still time to bargain:** With 7 rounds left, I can continue to push for a lower price without risking missing out on a better deal.
* **John's offer remains a fallback option:**  Knowing I can purchase from John provides security if Alice becomes too stubborn."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

* **Finding a middle ground:** This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, suggesting I'm actively seeking a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Pressure and time:** With 6 rounds remaining, I'm applying pressure by demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still having time to explore other options if necessary."

* **Time pressure:** With 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing, making it more likely Alice will consider this offer.

* **Safety and certainty:** Buying from John provides certainty that I'll secure the product without the risk of further haggling."
