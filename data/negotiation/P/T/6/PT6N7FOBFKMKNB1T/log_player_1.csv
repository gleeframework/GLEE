{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer right now, as it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $8,500 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still firm on my previous offer. $9,000 is my lowest price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time. Can you consider $8,500?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not convinced Bob is willing to come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've only got a couple of rounds left, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with John for a small gain with Bob."
