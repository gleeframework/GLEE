"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While we'd love to accommodate you, we need to maintain our pricing strategy. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount while ensuring we receive a fair value for our item.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but to make this work I'd need to be around $825,000. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your continued engagement. I understand your financial constraints, and I'm glad to meet you halfway. However, we also need to ensure we receive a fair return for our investment. With that in mind, I propose a final counteroffer of $840,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our needs and your budget.",840000.0,Alice,5,
