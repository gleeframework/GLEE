Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $1,050,000 to you. We're confident this investment will pay off significantly in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. While it's below his maximum budget, he can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds and should aim to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point to make this a truly worthwhile investment. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your perspective and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $1,000,000? This reflects both the value you see in the product and our willingness to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer ensures a successful purchase within a reasonable timeframe and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
