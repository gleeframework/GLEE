Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial ask. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  We're getting closer, and it's worth pushing a bit further to maximize potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,275,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise while recognizing the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By framing this as a ""final offer,"" we add a bit of urgency and signal that we're firm on this price. It's a small concession from our previous offer, but still maintains a significant margin above John's backup offer.  This puts the decision largely in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I need to be sure that I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we were aiming higher, Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is still a substantial profit ($225,000 above John's offer).  We're entering the later rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely if we push further.  It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer later."
