"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's also a fair price for Alice, as it's well above her minimum. Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
