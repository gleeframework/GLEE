"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",80.0,Bob,6,
