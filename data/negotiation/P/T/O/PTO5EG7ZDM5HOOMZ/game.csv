"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is a significant drop from my original offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
