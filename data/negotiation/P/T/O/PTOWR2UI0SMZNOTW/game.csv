"Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise while still recognizing the exceptional value this product offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, let's make this interesting. If you're willing to meet me halfway between our last offers, we have a deal. That puts it at $1,475,000, and I believe that's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
