"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would give you a great deal, and it would be a fair price for me as well. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,
