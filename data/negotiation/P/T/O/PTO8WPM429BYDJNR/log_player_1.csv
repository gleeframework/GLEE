Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I think I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd like to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob seems firm at $920,000.  Accepting this offer secures a sale well above my minimum goal of $800,000 and is closer to my target of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept."
