# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $180. This is way more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

$145 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with $140. I'll counteroffer one more time, but if Alice doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. $140 is still a little too high, but I'm willing to go up to $138. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 138}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $138. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $142. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $142 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my limit.  I've already made several counteroffers and I'm not sure if Alice is willing to go lower.  To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price, I'll buy the product from John for $120."
