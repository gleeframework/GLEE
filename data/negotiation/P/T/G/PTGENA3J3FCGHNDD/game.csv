"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $145 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your minimum and within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $140?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. $140 is still a little too high, but I'm willing to go up to $138. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with another option.",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $138. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $142. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",142.0,Alice,7,
