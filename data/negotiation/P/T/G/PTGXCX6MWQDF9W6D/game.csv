"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find the product worth every penny. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
