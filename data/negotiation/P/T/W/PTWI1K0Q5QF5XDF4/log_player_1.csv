Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can close the gap."

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can still get a slightly higher price. I'll counter with one last offer before considering selling to John."

Round 8

With only a couple of rounds left, I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my minimum. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob."
