"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that $140 is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum is $120, and I can sell to John for that.  
* **Negotiation Space:** $130 is still a bit below my ideal price, so there's room to continue negotiating. 
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $135 is still above my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll receive and emphasizing the ""great deal"" he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** $132.5 is very close to my desired price and significantly higher than my minimum of $120.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in Round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, accepting a price close to my ideal makes sense.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer doesn't preclude me from potentially working with Bob again in the future, possibly at a better price for me."
