"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind, but $650,000 is simply too low.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still a bit wide for me.  How about we try $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible here.  $750,000 is still a little too low, but I want to make sure we can reach a deal.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'd be willing to go up to $775,000 to get this deal done.  It's a strong offer and I think it reflects a fair agreement for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your offer is a good step forward, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  It's a good compromise that respects both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",812500.0,Alice,7,
