"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to go to John, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant drop from her initial offer and is closer to my target price.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another seller or having Alice walk away entirely is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
