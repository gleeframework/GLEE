"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial point and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's also important to remember that I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000, so I can be somewhat aggressive in my initial pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to reject it for now. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I have a few rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also conveys that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,700,000. It's a good compromise and above my minimum acceptable value. While I could keep trying to negotiate, it's getting closer to John's offer and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely."
