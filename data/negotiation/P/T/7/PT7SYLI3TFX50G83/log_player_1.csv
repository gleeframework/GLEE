"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $12,000 just yet. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering the value it offers. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to come up on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll take the $11,000 to avoid that risk and ensure I sell the product."
