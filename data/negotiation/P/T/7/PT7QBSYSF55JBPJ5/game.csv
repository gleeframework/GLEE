"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This still reflects a considerable discount on its true potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
