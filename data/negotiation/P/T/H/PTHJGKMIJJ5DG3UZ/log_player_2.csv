Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This would represent a significant saving for you while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
