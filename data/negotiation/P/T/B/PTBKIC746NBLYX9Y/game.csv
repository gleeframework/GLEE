"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be extremely valuable to your operations. My asking price is $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as the product is worth much more to you than that. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still represents a significant gain for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would give you a substantial value for the product while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm thinking $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  I'm willing to go a little lower to $975,000, but I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings to your business. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,8,
