# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you.  While it's worth at least $15,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity to acquire a product that would be worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
