Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product.  Let's be realistic – we both want a deal that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1450000 is closer to where we need to be, but  I'm still just a bit off.  We've both made concessions.  How about a final price of $1480000? It's a win-win scenario.  You get a great product at a fair price, and I can finally sell it.  Let's make this happen.
