Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a little more, it's getting close to my desired price and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it and having to sell to John for a lower price."
