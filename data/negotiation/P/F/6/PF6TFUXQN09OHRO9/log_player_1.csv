Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its high value (""value and potential""). This subtly justifies the higher asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob to engage in discussion (""What are your thoughts?""). This keeps the door open for counter-offers.

By starting at $15,000, Alice leaves room to potentially negotiate down to a price higher than John's $10,000 offer, while still aiming for the best possible outcome."
