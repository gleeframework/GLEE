Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $135 is more than Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you still get a profit, even if Bob accepts right away. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth and potential for a price closer to your ideal.

Remember, it's important to be firm but friendly during the negotiation. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
