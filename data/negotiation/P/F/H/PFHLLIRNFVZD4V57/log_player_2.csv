# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get a price closer to my target or if John's offer remains the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay.  I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, her offer of $1,280,000 is still above my budget.  It seems like we are hitting an impasse in our negotiations.  To avoid the risk of further rounds and potentially losing the opportunity to buy the product from John, I'm going to take John's offer and buy the product from him. This ensures I get the product at my desired price."
