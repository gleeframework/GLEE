Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $18,000. It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm for the product and emphasizing its value.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to buy for $12,000 gives me confidence to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While it's tempting to accept, I know I can potentially do better. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm confident that I can convince Bob to pay more, even if it's just a little. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and don't give up on the possibility of a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that's fair for both of us.  How about $15,000? It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting him halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize the reduction from my initial offer, making it clear I'm being flexible.
* **Reiterating my minimum:**  Mentioning $12,000 again serves as a reminder of my bottom line, but I'm not explicitly stating it's my final offer.

**Goal:** I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and relatively good sale, minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially lost time."
