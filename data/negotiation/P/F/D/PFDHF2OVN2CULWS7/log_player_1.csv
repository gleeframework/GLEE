"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $175. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and engaging, but firm in my initial price. 

**Strategy:**

I want to start high to maximize my profit potential.  However, I'm aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob won't come close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. While it's tempting to accept since I'm in a negotiation, I'm sticking to my principles. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I have John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested. I can come down to $160, but that's my absolute lowest.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $160. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Message:** I'm staying firm but open to negotiation. I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. By lowering the price slightly, I'm showing flexibility, but I'm still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product. Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'd prefer to sell it to John for $150, I'm realizing that negotiation is about compromise.  Given that I have limited rounds, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
