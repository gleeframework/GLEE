"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $200. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Is $140 a price you'd be willing to consider?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $160? It's a price that's closer to my minimum, but still a great value for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160, which would be $150. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Is $150 a price you'd be willing to accept?",150.0,Bob,6,
