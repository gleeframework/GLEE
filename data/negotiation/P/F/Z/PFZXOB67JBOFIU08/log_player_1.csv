Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might get rejected, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** 
    * Emphasizes the product's value.
    * Positions the price as fair rather than a bargain.
    * Introduces a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000
    *  Allows Bob a $50,000 profit margin, making it attractive to him.
    *  Secures you a $150,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Negotiation involves understanding the other party's motivations and adjusting your strategy accordingly.  Bob's risk tolerance and how badly he wants the product could influence his decision."
