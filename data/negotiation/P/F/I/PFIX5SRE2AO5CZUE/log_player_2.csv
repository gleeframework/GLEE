"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation if you have any concerns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope we can reach a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above your budget of $800,000. While it's closer, it's still not within your acceptable range. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant amount for me and a reasonable compromise considering your initial asking price. This offer reflects my budget limitations, but also my desire to make this deal happen. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. This offer is my final one. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial solution.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $950,000, it's still above your budget. You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that Alice will come down further.  At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the most financially sound decision. It saves you $150,000 compared to Alice's final offer and ensures you get the product within your budget."
