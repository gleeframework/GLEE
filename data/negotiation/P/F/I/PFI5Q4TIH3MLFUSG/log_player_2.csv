Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to agree on a price of $11,875 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is very close to the midpoint between your initial offer and hers. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  Accepting the $11,875 saves you a good amount compared to John's price."
