"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $675000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $600000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,4,
