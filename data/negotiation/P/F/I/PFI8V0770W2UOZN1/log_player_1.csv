Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price considering my valuation and the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 Bob's offer is far below my minimum value. It's worth exploring if we can reach a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will generate a great return for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still outside my budget.  While I recognize the value you're presenting, I can't go higher than $900000. This offer reflects a fair compromise considering my financial limitations and the potential return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's showing that he's willing to negotiate.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're getting closer. While $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for you, and it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents the maximum I'm able to offer. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I've already made several concessions.  I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to be able to get a price I'm happy with.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option for me at this point."
