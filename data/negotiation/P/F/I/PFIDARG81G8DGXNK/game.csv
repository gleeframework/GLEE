"Alice, $200 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I'm interested, but I can only offer $80 for it right now. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $180. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
