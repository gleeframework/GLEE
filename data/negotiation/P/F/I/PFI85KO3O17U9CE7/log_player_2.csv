"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal than $1,100,000.  Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that room and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  $950,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. However, it's still above Alice's value, so it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:**  The message reiterates your interest in the product and frames the counteroffer as a starting point for finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still above your ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to push for a lower price.  You're in a good position, knowing that you can always go to John for $1,200,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering your valuation and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splits the Difference:** This counteroffer directly addresses Alice's previous offer and suggests a compromise. It shows you're willing to meet halfway and  demonstrates a commitment to finding a solution.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reaffirms your understanding of Alice's valuation and highlights the value you see in the product, justifying your price point.
* **Direct and Clear:**  This counteroffer is concise and focused on the price, making it easy for Alice to understand and respond to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll come down to $1025000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $1,025,000 is a very good price for you, considering your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You've saved a significant amount compared to John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come down from her initial price. It's likely you won't get a much better offer.
* **Risk of Delay:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a delay, and there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without further risk."
