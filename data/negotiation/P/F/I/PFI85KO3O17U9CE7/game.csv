"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is a fair price considering your valuation and the value I see in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll come down to $1025000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
