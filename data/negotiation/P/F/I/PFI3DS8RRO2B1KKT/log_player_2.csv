Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I can do $110, which is my best and final offer below $120. If you're interested, let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid potentially overpaying."
