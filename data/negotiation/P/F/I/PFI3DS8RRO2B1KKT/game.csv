"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $150 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. I can do $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. Let's meet in the middle.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $70.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $70, but I can try to meet you halfway from $120. I can do $100, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $100 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I can do $110, which is my best and final offer below $120. If you're interested, let's make a deal!",110.0,Alice,7,
