"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can offer it to you for $1,300,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my limit based on my current budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching up, but very slowly.  We're still far from a price I find acceptable.  I'll continue negotiating for a few more rounds to test his willingness to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'll come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop:** I've lowered my price by a substantial $150,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge if Bob is willing to make significant moves or if he's firmly stuck near his initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant stretch for me.  I can do $775,000, but that's absolutely my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's movement is minimal, and he's declared his latest offer as ""final.""  It's clear he's not willing to approach a price point that's acceptable to me. Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 value, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob, potentially for a much lower final price."
