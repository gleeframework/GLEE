"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so my starting price is $1,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,250,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $1,125,000. This demonstrates my commitment to working with you, but it's as low as I can go at this point.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $1,075,000. I hope this proposal allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
