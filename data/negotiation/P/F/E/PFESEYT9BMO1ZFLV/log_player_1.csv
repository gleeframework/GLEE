Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so my starting price is $1,250,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,250,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to drop my price to $1,125,000. This demonstrates my commitment to working with you, but it's as low as I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $1,075,000. I hope this proposal allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is above my minimum threshold and represents a significant improvement from his previous offer. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to secure a profit."
