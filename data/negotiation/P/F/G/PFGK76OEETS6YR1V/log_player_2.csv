"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you and I believe it could greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. I am willing to sell the product for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500. This is a good deal for Bob because it's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and it's a good price for Alice as it's more than her value of $12,000.  It's unlikely Bob will get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether."
