Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's truly one-of-a-kind and worth every penny.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $900000. This is my final offer, can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a significant gain compared to his initial offer of $800,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the deal."
