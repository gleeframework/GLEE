Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'd be happy to sell it at that price, I'm open to offers. What would you say is a fair price for you?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $120 allows room for negotiation while staying significantly above Alice's minimum price.
* **Anchoring:** By stating Bob's perceived value ($150), we anchor the negotiation around a higher number, making $120 seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to offers"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially offer a price closer to $150. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out completely.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
