"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I'd be happy to sell it at that price, I'm open to offers. What would you say is a fair price for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Alice is starting high, $120 is still a significant discount from your maximum price of $150 and a better deal than buying from John."
