"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $120. This means there is room for negotiation.  It's always better to try and get a lower price, especially since you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering $105, which is closer to Alice's value of $100 but still leaves some profit for her.
* This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying the product but also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than my target price of $150.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good price.
* It's important to remember that John's price of $150 is my upper limit, so I need to keep my counteroffers below that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum price of $150, I still have room for negotiation. It's worth risking another round to see if I can get a better deal. Remember, even if I buy from John, I'll only lose $10 compared to accepting Alice's current offer.  It's worth seeing if I can close the deal with Alice for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm increasing my offer to $125. This is a significant jump from my previous offer of $115, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. 
* I'm still keeping the price below John's offer, but I'm getting closer to Alice's likely acceptance point.  
* With only 4 rounds remaining, this offer is a good attempt to push Alice towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $145 is only $5 more than John's price of $150.
* We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly better price from Alice.
* Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a price within my budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price."
