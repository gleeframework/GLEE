"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,050,000. Would that work for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while respecting your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
