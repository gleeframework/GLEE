Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you (Alice) and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the higher price, especially if he perceives the product as having unique value.
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. If Bob rejects your offer, you haven't lost anything. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still having a secure backup plan."
