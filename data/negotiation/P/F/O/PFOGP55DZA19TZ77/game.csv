,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $110? This is still a great price for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $105.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to make a profit on this product.  $105 isn't quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to sell the product for $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",108.0,Alice,5,
