"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a fair price for the product.  Let's find a middle ground!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about $12,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're still holding firm on your price, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $12,750?  That's a fair price for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally reach an agreement.  What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're not seeing eye to eye on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is a good deal for both of us. It's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
