"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with simply getting my minimum value.  I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'll see if I can nudge him up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for his initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my preferred price, but I'm still not ready to accept it.  I'm going to see if I can get him to move a bit further by counteroffering again.  I have a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to his range. I'm trying to show him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than my minimum and John's offer.  I'm going to reject and try to get a bit more in the next round.  I have 4 rounds left and there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,275,000.  This is a smaller increment than before, but it still shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I have 3 rounds left, so I need to start getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  I've tried to negotiate a better price, but it seems he's not willing to go higher.  It's better to accept John's offer and secure my minimum value than to risk getting stuck with a lower price or no deal at all."
