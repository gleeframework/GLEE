Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's  higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation and still represents a significant benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. It's also halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to meet in the middle."
