"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice.  

The optimal strategy is to try to push the price down as low as possible, aiming for a price somewhere between Alice's minimum value ($800,000) and Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 but still offers a profit for Alice above her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives Alice a reason to consider the counteroffer, while also demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  There's not much room for further negotiation to get a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
