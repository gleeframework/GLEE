Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $110 feels like a ""deal"" compared to a round number like $120, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $110. If he rejects the offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
