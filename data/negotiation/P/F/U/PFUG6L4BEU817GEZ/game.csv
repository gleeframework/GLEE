"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750000,  a significant reduction.  I believe this reflects the value we've discussed and allows room for further negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now. Let's split the difference: I'm prepared to offer $800000. This demonstrates my commitment to a deal, and I believe it fairly reflects the value we've both discussed.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",815000.0,Alice,5,
