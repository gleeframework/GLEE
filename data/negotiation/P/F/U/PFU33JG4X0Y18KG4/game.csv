"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth that much to you. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering it's worth $800,000 to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $750,000? It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your return, and $750,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to compromise further, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $737,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",737500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at $731,000?  That's a pretty significant move on my part.  What do you think?",731000.0,Bob,6,
