"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit too high for me, but I'm very interested in the product. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, to be frank, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,375,000.  How about $1,600,000? This is a significant compromise on my end.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your compromise is noted and I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider my options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
