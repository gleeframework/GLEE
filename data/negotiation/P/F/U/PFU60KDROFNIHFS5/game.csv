"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate the value proposition of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the market value, however, this product offers unique advantages that aren't reflected in similar products. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
