"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 
 
I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob's value is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while also maximizing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  While $12,000 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $11,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $10,000 and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm confident that further negotiation might not result in a higher offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
