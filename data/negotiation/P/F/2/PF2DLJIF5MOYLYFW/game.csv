"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? I think that's a more reasonable compromise given the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the quality and features you're getting.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",14000.0,Bob,4,
