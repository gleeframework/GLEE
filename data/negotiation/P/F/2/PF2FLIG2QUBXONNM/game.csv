"I'm interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value I've seen so far.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to me is at least $1000000. I think it's a fair compromise and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $960000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I've seen so far.",960000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $960000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $970000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise and I'm open to negotiating further if needed.",970000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $970000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $965000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I've seen so far.",965000.0,Bob,6,

"I've given it my best shot, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $970000. I think this is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at $965000, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a premium service package worth $5000? That would bring the total price to $970000. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,7,
