Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's room to make even more profit from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to see it as a potential gain.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
* **Confident Negotiation:** By leading with the product's value and your confidence in the price, you set a strong tone for the negotiation. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still maintaining the safety net of selling to John."
