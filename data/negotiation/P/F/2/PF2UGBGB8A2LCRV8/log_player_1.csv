{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This sets the stage for negotiation while leaving room for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my top price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I am open to negotiation, I will not accept such a low offer. It's time to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise further.  It's time to move on and secure the higher price offered by John."
