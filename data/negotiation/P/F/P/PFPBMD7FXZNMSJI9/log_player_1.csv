"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is willing to negotiate in good faith.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the next round, and selling to John would only net me $1,500,000.  It's time to take the deal."
