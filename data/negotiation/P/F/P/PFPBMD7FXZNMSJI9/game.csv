,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1400000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
