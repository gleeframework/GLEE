# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession.
