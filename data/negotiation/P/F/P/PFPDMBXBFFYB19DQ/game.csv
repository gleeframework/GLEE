"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond that figure. Would you consider $1,275,000? I believe this strikes a better balance between its worth and my initial asking price.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
