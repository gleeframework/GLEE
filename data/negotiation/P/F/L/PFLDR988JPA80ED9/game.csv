"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal and move on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
