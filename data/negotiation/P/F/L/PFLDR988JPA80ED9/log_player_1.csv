"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for further negotiation. This way, I start strong, while also giving Bob the impression that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway at $1,000,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm starting to risk losing too much money.  It's time to move on to John who's offering a much better price."
