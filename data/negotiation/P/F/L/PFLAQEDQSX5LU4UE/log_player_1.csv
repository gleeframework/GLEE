Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $19,000.  Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $19,000. Would you be willing to consider $17,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go higher, and $17,500 is a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to take this offer than risk him walking away for a smaller potential gain.
