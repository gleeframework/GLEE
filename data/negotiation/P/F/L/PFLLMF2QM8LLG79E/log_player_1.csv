Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. If Bob rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and see if I can negotiate a higher price.  If he's too low, I'll cut my losses and go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'd accept, I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit. $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, showing flexibility while still holding value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as it seems Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my last counteroffer.  While I would have preferred to get $1,250,000,  $1,200,000 is a good deal and is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
