Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. What would you say to a price of $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $150 to Bob, we want to aim for a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for us.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to push for a lower price.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $100 offer. This ensures that even with a price reduction in negotiation, we're still likely to get a better deal with Bob. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit with Bob while acknowledging the backup option of selling to John."
