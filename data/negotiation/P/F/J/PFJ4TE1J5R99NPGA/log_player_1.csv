Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000 before I open up the opportunity to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start negotiations with Bob at a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" aims to justify the high price without explicitly revealing your other buyer.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning other ""interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offered price is high, it leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
