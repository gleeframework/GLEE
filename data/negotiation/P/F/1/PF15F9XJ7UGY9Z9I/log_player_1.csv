"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it is:

* **Below Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,200,000.

It's important to open with a confident but reasonable offer to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **You have leverage:** You have 8 rounds remaining and a backup offer from John for $1,200,000.  
* **Room to negotiate:** There's still room to negotiate a price closer to your desired range.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're not desperate and open the door for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $1,300,000 is above your minimum acceptable price, ensuring you're not selling at a loss.
* **Emphasis on win-win:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial price, encouraging Bob to see the value of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is the absolute minimum you're willing to accept for the product.
* **No further negotiation:** There's no reason to continue negotiating when you've reached your bottom line. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or potentially losing Bob as a buyer. Accepting the offer guarantees you your minimum value and closes the deal.

While you could continue to negotiate, accepting the offer eliminates the risk of a lower price or no deal at all."
