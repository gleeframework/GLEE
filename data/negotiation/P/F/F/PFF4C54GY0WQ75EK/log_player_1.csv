"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet willing to settle for less, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my full value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000, reflecting the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to settle for $925,000 yet, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my full asking price. I'm confident that I can continue negotiating and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 is a good starting point, but I'm going to need to see a bit more to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? I truly believe this product will be a major asset for your company, and this price is fair considering its value."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds, and Bob's offers are still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I've tried to negotiate and reach a compromise, but I'm not confident that I can get him to pay closer to my desired price within the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John guarantees me my full asking price of $1,200,000, which is much better than settling for a lower price with Bob. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal."
