Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing the details further.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to aim high with Bob. Starting at $2,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while potentially securing a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" rather than just its features. This subtly anchors Bob's perception to a higher price point. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing the details further""  signals that you're willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, you would adapt your approach based on Bob's responses and reactions."
