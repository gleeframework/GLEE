"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a decent price, it's still above your desired maximum of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Offering $85 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's below Alice's desired price of $80, but it's still a fair price for both parties. This counteroffer shows that you're serious about purchasing the product, but you're also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92 is higher than your initial counteroffer of $85.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely the price won't drop to your desired level.  Given that John is selling the product for $100, it's a better decision to buy from him."
