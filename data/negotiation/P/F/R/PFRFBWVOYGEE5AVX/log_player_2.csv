"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable for you, so I'm proposing a price of $130. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly starting high. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or get a better deal from John."
