"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is very fair. I'm asking for $1150000. This gives you a significant savings while still allowing me to get a great price for my product.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
