Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:**  This ensures you're still getting a good price even if Bob accepts the first offer.

By leaving room for negotiation, you encourage Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  You can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000).**  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.
* **Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable value.**  This is a safer option than risking further negotiations with Bob.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer opens the door for further negotiation.**  You can counter with a higher price, potentially bringing Bob closer to your desired price point.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and keep the possibility of a better deal open.  While selling to John is always an option, you haven't exhausted all possibilities with Bob yet."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum acceptable value. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  This demonstrates flexibility and increases the likelihood that Bob will counter again.
* **Highlight value and offer a good deal:**  Framing the price as a ""good deal"" for Bob may make him more receptive to your offer.
