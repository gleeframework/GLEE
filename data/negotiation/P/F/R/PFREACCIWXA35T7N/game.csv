"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price reflects a substantial discount for you and allows me to acquire the product within my financial limitations.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should meet both of our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
