"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair deal. How about we start at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm unable to accept $9,000 as it's below my valuation. Considering the value this product holds, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
