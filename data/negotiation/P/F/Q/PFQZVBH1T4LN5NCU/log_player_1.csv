Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay.  I'm confident John will be my backup buyer if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than what I need. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price of $12,000. John remains a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in this price and is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm keeping in mind that John is a backup buyer, but I'm still determined to get the highest price possible from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, this offer from Bob is a good compromise.  He's shown willingness to negotiate, and $9,800 is a fair price considering John's offer is $12,000. It's important to be flexible and find a solution that works for both parties, and I'm happy to close the deal with Bob at this price."
