Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my own valuation while still giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet. There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's getting closer to a potentially acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating,  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum value. The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price."
