Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Aiming for Maximum Profit:**  While the product is worth $80 to both you and Bob, your goal is to maximize your profit.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more than the minimum value, especially if he perceives the product as valuable.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John who will buy the product for $80. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
