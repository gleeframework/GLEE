You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer.
* You have room to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* This gives me a good starting point for bargaining and hopefully allows me to get a better price without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now $950,000, which is still within my budget of $1,200,000.
* While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge, and I might end up paying more in the long run. 
* Accepting this offer is a good compromise, ensuring I get the product for a good price without risking a higher price later."
