Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly less than Bob's perceived value but still a decent profit for me.  I believe it's a reasonable offer that encourages Bob to negotiate further, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm confident this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still offering a good profit for me."
