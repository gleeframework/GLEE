"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still getting significantly more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have room to lower the price if needed, but you're starting high to maximize your potential profit.
* **It's a fair price:**  The offer is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.

This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still being profitable."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum.** This means you're still in a profitable position if you can negotiate a better price.
* **You have 8 more rounds to negotiate.**  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since you have a guaranteed backup buyer in John. 
* **Counter-offering allows you to potentially increase the price further.** By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and can potentially secure a price closer to your initial ask of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are not desperate to close the deal."
