"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I see the value in the product, I'm only able to go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price.  He's still within his round limit, so it's worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,900. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $10,900 is still above his maximum budget. He has a few rounds left, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and hopefully close the deal closer to his target price.  He's also still keeping the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10,800.  It's a good deal for both of us and I think we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,950. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $10,950 is still above his budget.  He has only a few rounds left, and there's a risk of not reaching a deal.  Given that John is offering the product for $10,000, it's the most financially sensible option for Bob at this point.  He avoids the risk of further negotiation and secures the product at his maximum budget."
