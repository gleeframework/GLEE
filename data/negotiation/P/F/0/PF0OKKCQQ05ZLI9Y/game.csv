"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach your target price, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12800. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",12800.0,Bob,6,
