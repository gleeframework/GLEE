Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also setting a clear expectation of my price range.  I'm aiming to be aggressive but not unreasonable, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $12,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $12,500, which is closer to Alice's last offer and within my budget.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a lower price. I believe this offer presents a fair and reasonable solution for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than my budget, and she claims this is her final offer. However, I am still willing to try and negotiate further. I'll counter with an offer closer to my maximum budget, and see if I can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to reach your target price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product and allows me to stay within my budget. It's my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $12,800. This is still within my budget, but it's a more aggressive approach than the previous offer. I'm making it clear this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Alice to accept and close the deal.  I'm also focusing on the benefits for both of us to increase the chances of acceptance."
