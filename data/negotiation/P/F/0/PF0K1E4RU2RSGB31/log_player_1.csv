"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but also demonstrating that I'm not simply looking for the minimum price.  I'm aiming for a good deal while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. However, it's still a substantial profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's early in the negotiation process, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's last offer, but I'm also showing flexibility. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to push for a higher price, the negotiation has gone on for several rounds. Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even losing the deal entirely."
