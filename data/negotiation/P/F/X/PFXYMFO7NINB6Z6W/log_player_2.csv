"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You're looking to save as much as possible, and a counteroffer will allow you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is closer to your desired price point, but it's still higher than you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to continue the bargaining process."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,225,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,162,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1162500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  While $1,162,500 is a tempting offer, I'm holding firm on a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,190,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,190,000 is just slightly higher than your last counteroffer of $1,162,500.  It's a fair compromise, and it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer saves you a significant amount of money."
