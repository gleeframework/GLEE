# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget and offers a reasonable compromise.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John for a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product within your budget and avoids the potential for further negotiation complications."
