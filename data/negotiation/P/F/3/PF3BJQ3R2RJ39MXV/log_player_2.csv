Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

While $16,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target."
