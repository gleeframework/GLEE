{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  It also allows me to get a good price without having to resort to selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I think I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your $95 offer. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more counteroffer to try and push the price higher. If Bob rejects that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort in trying to find a compromise.  $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92, which is a fair price given the value of the product. If you're serious about getting this, I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my budget. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to $92. I propose $88 as my final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I've already made several counteroffers and it's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, ensuring I at least get my minimum price."
