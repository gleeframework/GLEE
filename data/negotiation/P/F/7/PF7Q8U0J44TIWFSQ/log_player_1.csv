Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $10,000. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value, and I make a $2,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, potentially increasing the profit margin.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring a sale."
