Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, leveraging the information we have:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Safety Net:** We know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, providing a strong fallback position if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid immediate rejection. 
* **Relationship Building:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial deal, which can help foster a positive negotiation atmosphere."
