"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160 to see if we can find a middle ground.  What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer!  However, $135 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $142.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $142.50 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $138. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $138 is closer, I'm still not quite there. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
