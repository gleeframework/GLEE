"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer. I understand that $20,000 is a significant investment. While I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $14,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's settle this at $12,500.  This offer takes into account both our positions.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  While $11,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $11,750.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,7,
