"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, and that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if that's not acceptable to you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
