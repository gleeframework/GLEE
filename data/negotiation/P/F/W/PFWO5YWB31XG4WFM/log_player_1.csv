Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach might work, providing a brief reason for the price can make Bob more receptive.  Mentioning ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" frames the offer positively.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John. Knowing you can sell the product for $8,000 to him gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your asking price, but always keep your $8,000 minimum in mind."
