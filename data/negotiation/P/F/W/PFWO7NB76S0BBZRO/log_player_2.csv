"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $100. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price.  We'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting our counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but slightly above her perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate upward while aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite & Reasonable:** The message maintains a polite tone and avoids being overly aggressive, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget, I propose we set the product price at $90. Does this offer suit your needs? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a lower price. We're not in a hurry, so rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving in our favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87?"",
""product_price"": 87
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between our last offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a lower price.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  We continue to be polite and respectful in our communication, which can help facilitate a smoother negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering your preference, I suggest we finalize the deal at $88. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down to $88, which is a solid discount from her initial offer of $100 and well below our maximum budget of $120.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two in savings. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk her withdrawing the offer altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now saves us time and secures a good price."
