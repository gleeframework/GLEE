"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your starting price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, $1,300,000  doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  To move forward, I would need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. While closer to my maximum, it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your position, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and reflects a genuine desire to reach an agreement.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I've given this some thought, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I still have room to negotiate and can potentially save more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's make this happen. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
