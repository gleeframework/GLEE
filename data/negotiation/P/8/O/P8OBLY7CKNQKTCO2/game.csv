,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle at $120?  That would be a good middle ground for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can meet you at $140. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really get your money's worth out of this product.",140.0,Alice,5,
