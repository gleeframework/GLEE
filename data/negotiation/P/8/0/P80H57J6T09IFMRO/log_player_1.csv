"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth more than $80 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will start the conversation and get Bob thinking about the value he might get from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $95 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great price for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $92. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $91 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value to me and our negotiation history. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $91 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the negotiation history and the risk of Bob walking away completely. It's also a much better deal than selling to John for $120, which would be my fallback option."
