"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
