Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm emphasizing the value and the potential for a ""win-win"" situation. 
* **Option to Move On:** This offer keeps John as a safety net, reminding me that I don't have to settle for a price lower than $12,000 if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 right now.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price. 
* **John is the Backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this deal happen. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm not dropping to his initial offer, showing that I'm still serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $9,250 is very close to my target price of $9,500.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower profit.  
* **Time Consideration:**  The back and forth is already taking time, and it's a good deal considering the minimum I was willing to accept."
