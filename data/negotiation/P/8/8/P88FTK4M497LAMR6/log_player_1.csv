"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your price point. However, I can't go as low as $7,500.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $9,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $8000. Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would have liked to get closer to my original asking price, $8,000 is a fair price and it's better than selling to John for the same amount."
