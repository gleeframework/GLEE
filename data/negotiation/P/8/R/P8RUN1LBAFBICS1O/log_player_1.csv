Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to drop to $14,000. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,500?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $15,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $15,750 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's a good deal for both of us and saves time and effort in further negotiation."
