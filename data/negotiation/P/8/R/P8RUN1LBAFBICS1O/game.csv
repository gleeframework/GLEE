"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,500?  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $15,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",15750.0,Bob,4,
