"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering a price above my minimum, I have room to negotiate downwards if needed.

**Strategy:**

I'll aim to negotiate down from this starting price, but if Bob rejects my offer too quickly or his counteroffers are too low, I'll switch to John who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully reach a more favorable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $150, but there's a chance I can get more through negotiation with Bob.  I'm willing to take that risk for now. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This still gives me a fair margin, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $140 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and a good deal for both parties, encouraging Bob to consider my counter.
* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While closer to my minimum, there's still room to potentially negotiate down to $135 if necessary.

**Strategy:**

I aim to find a middle ground with Bob. If he rejects again, I'll be prepared to make a final offer or go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation window closing:** While there's still room to negotiate, we're getting closer to the end of the rounds.
* **Risk assessment:**  I'm willing to take the risk of potentially losing a deal with Bob to see if I can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous one, aiming to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll really appreciate the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a final compromise at $130, which is halfway between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's last offer of $115. 
* **Urgency:** My message subtly implies that this is my final offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product and framing the price as fair for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this final compromise will be enough to convince Bob. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $130 is still a bit too high. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $110 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've reached a stalemate.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining, the odds of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are slim. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum and a safe bet considering the current negotiation trajectory. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  selling to John now ensures I don't risk getting stuck with a lower price or having the negotiation run out of time.  It's the most logical and financially responsible choice at this point."
