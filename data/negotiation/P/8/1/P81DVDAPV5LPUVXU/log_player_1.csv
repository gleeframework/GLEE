Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
