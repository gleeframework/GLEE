Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000 with John. 

By offering $1,400,000, I am aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value, giving him a good deal.
* **Profitable for me:** It's well above my minimum and allows me to earn a good profit. 

This offer maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider accepting."
