Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,800 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,900 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.
