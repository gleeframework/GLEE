"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
