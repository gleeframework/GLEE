"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's closer to her value than mine. I need to negotiate a lower price or consider buying from John if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** By starting at $6,000, I signal that I'm serious about buying but expect a counteroffer. This leaves space for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to buy from John. Starting low encourages Alice to move towards a more reasonable price quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $8,500 is still above my maximum budget and very close to what I could get from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $8,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a price above my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and her counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  $7,000 keeps me below my maximum and leaves room for a potential final concession from either side.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Expressing my eagerness to close the deal might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching My Limit:** Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Equivalent to John's Offer:**  I can buy the product from John for the same price.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now saves me from potentially drawn-out negotiations with no guarantee of a better price. 

While I could try to haggle Alice down a little further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and ending up with nothing. Accepting her offer at my maximum budget is the most logical decision at this point."
