"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to make it more appealing. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a somewhat aggressive price, I aim to push Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer. This will allow me to gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy for future rounds. If he rejects, I can use the remaining rounds to gradually lower the price until we reach an agreement or I choose to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  It's not even close to the $8,000 value it holds for him. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I will use this opportunity to counter with a price that is closer to my minimum value, aiming to find a middle ground.  I have 8 rounds remaining, so I have time to negotiate.  Selling to John for $12,000 remains a viable option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still represents a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $8,500, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value proposition of the product.  I'm framing it as a compromise and a ""great deal"" for him, encouraging him to reconsider.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that is more favorable to me, while still demonstrating flexibility to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. This counteroffer allows for potential further negotiation while still staying within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still far from what the product is worth to me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I have 6 rounds remaining, so I can continue to negotiate and try to reach a more acceptable price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping my offer to $8,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns but reaffirming the value of the product. I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a good final offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a more aggressive approach in this round. By lowering the price, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. However, I'm still holding firm on a price that is close to my minimum value.  This strategy aims to find a compromise that is fair to both parties while also securing a better price for me."
