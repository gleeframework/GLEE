Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's value while ensuring you don't scare him away.  Offering a price slightly below his perceived value allows room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the value to Bob and positioning the price as ""fair"" rather than a hard bargain.
* **Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation but secures a significant profit for you. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could start higher, especially if you sense Bob is eager or has less negotiating experience. However, this offer balances risk and reward effectively."
