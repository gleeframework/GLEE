"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $7,800. How about we meet in the middle again at $8,300? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to get a deal done.",8300.0,Alice,5,
