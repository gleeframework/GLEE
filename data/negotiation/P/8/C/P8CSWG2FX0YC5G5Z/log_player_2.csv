"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,500. I think this is a great deal considering the value it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Although Alice's offer is close to my maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer significantly undercuts Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. By starting low, I leave room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting me closer to the middle, which is a good sign. However, her counter offer is still above its value to her ($8,000). I believe there's still room for negotiation. I will try to nudge her closer to $8,000 without going over."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,800.  Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while staying below my psychological threshold of $8,000. It also signals to Alice that I'm serious about the purchase but looking for a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $7,800. How about we meet in the middle again at $8,300? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly anchoring on the $8,500 price point and moving down very slowly.  While I could likely negotiate a little lower, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting at $8,300 avoids the risk of her retracting the offer and still saves me money compared to John."
