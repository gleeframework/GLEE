"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to pay up to $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the value I've attached to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,000,000. Is this a more comfortable price for you?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel that I'm getting a fair price for the product. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
