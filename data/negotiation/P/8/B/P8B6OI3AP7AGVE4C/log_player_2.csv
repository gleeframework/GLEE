Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.
