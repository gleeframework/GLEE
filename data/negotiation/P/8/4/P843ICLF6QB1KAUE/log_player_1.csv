Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum value of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's maximum value of $150.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, increasing the chance of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get closer to the $140 mark, Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120.  It's a good deal considering Bob could walk away and you'd only get $120 from John."
