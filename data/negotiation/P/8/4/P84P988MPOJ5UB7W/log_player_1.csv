"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and signals that you value the product. 
* **Just below Bob's Value:** The $1,100,000 offer is slightly below Bob's perceived value, giving him an immediate incentive to consider the deal seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob's thoughts and implies a willingness to negotiate, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 

This strategy balances ambition with the understanding that a deal is more likely with some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably below both your starting offer and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a price that better reflects the product's worth. You're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing what you're selling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We've lowered our price by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay Above Midpoint:** This offer remains above the midpoint between Bob's offer and our initial price, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Justify the Price:**  The message clearly ties the price to the product's inherent worth, not just our desired profit margin.
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While compromising, we're still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.

This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged while subtly steering the negotiation toward a more favorable outcome for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. I propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a substantial profit margin, exceeding our minimum by $200,000.
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  Both parties have moved closer to a middle ground, indicating Bob's seriousness.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner avoids further negotiation rounds and potential deadlocks. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While we could push for more, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting secures a significant profit now.

This decision prioritizes securing a substantial profit rather than gambling on potentially extracting a slightly higher amount from Bob."
