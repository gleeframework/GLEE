"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so this leaves some room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I have a guaranteed $8,000 offer from John as a backup.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a $500 profit margin.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it.  There's no point in delaying further as I've already reached my desired outcome and I'm confident I can't do better."
