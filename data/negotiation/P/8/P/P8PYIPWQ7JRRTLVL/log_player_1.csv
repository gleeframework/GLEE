"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  By starting high, we can see how interested Bob is in the product. If he immediately rejects the offer, we know we need to come down significantly. If he counters, it gives us a better understanding of his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $200 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly less than our minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is low, his message indicates he's interested. There's room to negotiate towards a more agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:** We always have the option to sell to John for our minimum, so there's no need to rush into a deal with Bob if it's not beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $200 was my initial offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** We're showing Bob that we're willing to negotiate by moving away from our initial price.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **""Meeting in the middle"" Psychology:** This framing can be persuasive, even though it's not a true middle ground given the starting points."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge much higher:** Bob has now made two offers, both significantly below our minimum. His latest offer and message suggest he's anchored to a price point around $120.
* **We're approaching diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely we'll reach our desired range. Each round carries the risk of Bob walking away or us having to make further concessions. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $150. It's a low-risk option that ensures a reasonable profit."
