"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
