{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,350,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I appreciate his interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident we can find a more agreeable price point in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
