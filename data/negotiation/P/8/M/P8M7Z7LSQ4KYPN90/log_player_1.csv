"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might reject it.  This allows for some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm countering with $17,000, which is still higher than my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a better price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than my last one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm not ready to give up just yet.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,500.  I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I'm willing to come down a little further, but I want to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are down to the last couple of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  It seems like we are stuck at an impasse. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and potentially getting an even lower counteroffer.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures that I get at least my minimum value and doesn't risk ending up with a lower price."
