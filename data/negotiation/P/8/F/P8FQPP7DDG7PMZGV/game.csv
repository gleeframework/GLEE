"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal today. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product would be a good fit, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $14,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is cutting it too close.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is really the most I can do. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
