Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum since the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is still a good deal for him, as it's significantly less than the product's value to him, and it's closer to my desired price than his initial counteroffer.  I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price."
