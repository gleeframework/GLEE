,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $7500, but I'd like to get closer to my target. How about $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $7800, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8100? It's a small step down from my original price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not quite there, Alice. I'd be willing to pay $7800, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. How about $7900?",7900.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8050? It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $7900. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $7950?",7950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any further, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not comfortable going below my minimum price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $8000, and that's it.",8000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to walk away, Alice, but I'm willing to take one last chance. I'll meet you at $7900, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from someone else.",7900.0,Bob,10,
