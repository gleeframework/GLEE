{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between Alice's value and my maximum. This should prompt further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I still believe I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially reach an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
