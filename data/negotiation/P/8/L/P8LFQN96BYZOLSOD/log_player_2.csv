"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,050,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,150,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000, and you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
