"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. This offer reflects my budget constraints while still acknowledging the value of your product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,050,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could meet you at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering both our positions.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,150,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
