"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some incentive to accept while also allowing for some bargaining if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to meet you halfway.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $12,000 would be a fair price for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's stuck on $12,000, I'm still hoping for a better price. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $13,000. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. I truly believe this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued negotiation, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. However, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to accept $13,000 for the product. My final offer remains at $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firmly set on $12,000, and I've already made several concessions.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob will only waste time and I might not be able to secure a better offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
