"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well.  I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is a fair price considering my constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,200,000?  That's a significant reduction, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1000000?  This would give you a substantial profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation.  While I could potentially get a higher price in future rounds, there's no guarantee, and I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether."
