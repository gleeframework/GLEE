"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's more than double your budget.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1200000?  That's a significant reduction, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,000,000?  This would give you a substantial profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
