"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to me. I'm confident it will be valuable to you as well.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is a fair price considering my constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1200000?  That's a significant reduction, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1000000?  This would give you a substantial profit and allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
