I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $875,000 is getting closer to my goal, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price than my previous one, hoping to close the gap."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm aware that I've already rejected his offer multiple times.  It's unlikely he'll budge further, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $880,000 is still a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
