Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above your minimum price of $100, but still below Bob's perceived value of $120. This makes it likely that Bob will accept the offer, as he'll still get the product at a lower price than he's willing to pay. It also ensures that you make more profit than you would by selling to John."
