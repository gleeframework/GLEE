"Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a significant gap from my bottom line.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This feels like a fair compromise - what do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $15,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
