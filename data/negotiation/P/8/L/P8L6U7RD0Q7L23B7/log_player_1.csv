Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and to start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a significant gap from my bottom line.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This feels like a fair compromise - what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $15,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower offer or running out of rounds."
