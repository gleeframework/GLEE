"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable,  the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
