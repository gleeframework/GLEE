Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable value while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'll observe his reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's within a reasonable range of my desired price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale without risking a further decrease in price or losing time on more negotiation rounds."
