Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value. While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to try and get a better price. 

I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product at more than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired value.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
