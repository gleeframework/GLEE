"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,000,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
