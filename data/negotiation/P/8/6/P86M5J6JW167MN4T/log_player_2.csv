"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. While I can't disclose the specifics right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1500000, which is a significant opportunity given its true value.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This saves you $300,000."
