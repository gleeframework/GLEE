,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Can we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and my previous offer of $125, so I'm counteroffering at $115. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"We're really close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, which is right in the middle of my previous offer of $115 and your latest offer of $110. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",112.5,Alice,9,
