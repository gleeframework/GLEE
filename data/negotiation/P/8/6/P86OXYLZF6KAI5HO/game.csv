"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I think this product has potential, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it,  let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $16,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price again.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",15500.0,Alice,5,
