"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal, but unfortunately, my maximum budget remains at $9,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $9,000 budget, but I really need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's think about it this way:  This product can save you a lot of money in the long run, and it's a one-time investment.  If you're willing to compromise a bit, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the compromise, but I still believe $9,000 is the most I can offer. I hope this is acceptable for you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
