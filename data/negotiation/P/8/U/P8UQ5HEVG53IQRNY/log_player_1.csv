"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it, as I mentioned in my previous message. Can you meet me at this price or lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a bit. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm not giving in too much. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm also trying to keep the conversation friendly and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out hope for a slightly better deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer in the next round to see if I can nudge Bob up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $115 for the product.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going down to $115, which is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for a profit. This is my last counteroffer, so I'm trying to be firm but also emphasize the fairness of the price. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 more than what John is offering.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
