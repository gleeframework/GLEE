Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be of great value to you, and I'm offering it to you first. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high value for both you and Bob. This allows for a higher initial offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial offer. You can gradually lower the price, but always keep your minimum of $1,000,000 in mind."
