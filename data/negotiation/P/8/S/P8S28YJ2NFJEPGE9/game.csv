"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $10000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation.  I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still not quite there at $11000.  How about $10500?  It's closer to your last offer, and a more comfortable price point for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
