``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value of $12,000 but below my minimum of $15,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, and I can always fall back on selling to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:

I'm still not happy with the price.  It's getting closer to my minimum, but I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

That's a good price for both of us, and it will allow me to keep my profit margin reasonable.  Let's try to reach a compromise so we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
