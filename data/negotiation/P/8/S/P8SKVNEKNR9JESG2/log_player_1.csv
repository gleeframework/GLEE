"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that represents significant value. Consider it an investment with high potential. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the ""value"" and ""investment potential"" of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is phrased in a way that invites Bob to engage in discussion. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Unknown Value:** I'm going in blind, so the initial offer is a strategic gamble.
* **John's Offer:** The existence of John's offer ($1,200,000) provides a safety net and a point of comparison. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to maximize profit while staying above the $1,200,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  There's still room to find a compromise.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John immediately guarantees me $1,200,000, but I believe there's potential to earn more with Bob, especially if I counter with a more reasonable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to his offer, attempting to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000? This price still reflects the significant value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm explicitly framing this offer as a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, but focusing on a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" 

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to budge. If he rejects it, I'll likely offer a price closer to $1,200,000 in the next round, leaving little room for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a significant financial loss.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** While Bob is showing willingness to increase his offer, the gap between our positions is still significant.  There's a chance we could reach a compromise, but it's getting tighter.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John at this point would guarantee me $1,200,000. This offer is very close to my minimum, making it a tempting option. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to $1,200,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as there's a high chance Bob won't budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the real value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my final counteroffer before seriously considering John's offer.  
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, narrowing the gap significantly.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing ""closing this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer in the next round. The risk of not closing the deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
