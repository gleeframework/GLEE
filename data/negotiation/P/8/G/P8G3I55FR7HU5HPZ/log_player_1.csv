"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to get a quick deal. It's also important to be friendly and highlight the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $92 is a good compromise, especially considering the limited rounds remaining.  It's also important to remember that rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer could risk him walking away altogether."
