"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, my absolute maximum. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
