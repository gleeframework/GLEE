"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to create a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Flexibility:**  This initial offer leaves me room to adjust the price in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate shows that he's interested in the product, giving me an opportunity to explore a price closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control of the negotiation and signal that I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $95. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a small concession, showing flexibility but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Negotiation:**  We've gone through several rounds, and Bob's counteroffers are consistently too low.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting valuable time and potentially losing a more profitable opportunity with John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a $120 profit, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice."
