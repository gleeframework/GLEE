"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer above your target price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor. Even if this price is immediately rejected, it sets the tone for a higher potential sale price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate and hear Bob's perspective.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, starting high gives me the flexibility to potentially get an even better deal from Bob before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value of $1,200,000, indicating room for negotiation. While it's tempting to accept as it's more than his value, it's still significantly below both my target price and John's standing offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you offering a starting point. However, $1,300,000 is considerably lower than I believe this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down $200,000 from my initial offer, which demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also maintains a strong position. 
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing the ""true value"" to reinforce the idea that my price is grounded in worth, not arbitrary.
* **Maintaining Distance from John:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still aiming for a significantly higher number than John's offer, leaving room for potential compromises with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to move, and his offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to John's offer. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  With six rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to try and push the price closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and keeps us moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This offer splits the difference between my last offer ($1,800,000) and his last offer ($1,450,000) with a slight lean in my favor. 
* **Strong Call to Action:** I'm framing this as a ""win-win"" and using language that encourages Bob to accept, but I'm still keeping the pressure on to reach my target price. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we're past the halfway point in the negotiation, I'm becoming slightly more flexible, but I'm still holding firm above John's offer for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now matched John's offer. While I could try to push for more, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and there's a risk he walks away.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price ($500,000 above my minimum) without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
