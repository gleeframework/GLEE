Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and they could potentially settle on a price between $10,000 and $15,000. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind."
