"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm using the fact that I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price as leverage. 

I believe this strategy will encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to negotiate a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I'm hoping for.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John provides a safety net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the security to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for an unfavorable deal. 

I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my target, hoping to close the deal with Bob while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing act:**  I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Reasonable compromise:** This price reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Pressure on Bob:**  By moving closer to his counteroffer, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the opportunity.
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects again, while simultaneously keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for less than what I believe the product is worth.
* **John's offer remains a strong fallback:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my target, aiming to strike a deal with Bob while maximizing my profits."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, signaling my willingness to close the deal. 
* **Reaching the threshold:** This price is just below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, making it a very tempting offer for Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to go lower, I'm not giving up completely. I'm still holding back a bit, keeping John's offer as a backup option.

I believe this counteroffer will put substantial pressure on Bob to either accept or face the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price.

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is too high with limited rounds remaining."
