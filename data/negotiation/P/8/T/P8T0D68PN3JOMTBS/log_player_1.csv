Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, knowing it's more than Bob values it at, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more willing to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not starting at my absolute minimum, I have space to lower the price if needed, and potentially end up with a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am willing to pay $100 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that's still above my minimum price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from my initial offer.
* **Maintaining value:**  $110 is still a fair price for the product, considering it's worth $120 to John and $100 to Bob.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
