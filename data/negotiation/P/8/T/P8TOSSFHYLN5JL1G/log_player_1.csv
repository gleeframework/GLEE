Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $15,000 to both of us. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering Bob's offer and my own minimum. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is close to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $15,000. I'll accept his offer."
