You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is the best choice in this scenario.  You can do better than $18,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within your budget.  It's possible Alice will counter-offer, but if she does, you'll have room to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You're still $1000 above your limit, and it's worth trying to get closer to $15,000."

This offer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's offer, but still within your budget. This might be a good price point for a deal to be reached."
