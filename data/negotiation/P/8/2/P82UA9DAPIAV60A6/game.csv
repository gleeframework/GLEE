"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product has potential, but  $2,300,000 is not a realistic starting point. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a more reasonable figure.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to move this deal forward. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the reduction,  $2,000,000 is still far beyond what I'm comfortable paying. This product needs to make financial sense for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go at this time.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 remains significantly below the value this product offers. To find a compromise, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,750,000. This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,750,000 is still pushing it for me.  Let's be realistic, I'm looking for a deal here. I can go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, selling for anything less than $1,500,000 would be challenging. I'm willing to meet you halfway and close this deal at $1,600,000. This reflects a significant concession from my initial offer and could be our final point of discussion.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you mentioned $1,500,000 being a challenging point for you. I understand that. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 to finalize this deal.  This is a strong offer, and I think it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're very close to my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession and close this deal right now for $1,400,000. This offer stands only for the remainder of this discussion. After that, I'll need to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
