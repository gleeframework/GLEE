"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is too expensive. It's best to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down closer to her value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's value ($80).  This leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also increases the chance of securing a good deal early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still above our target price. We'll politely decline and counter to see if we can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** By suggesting a price directly in between our last two offers, we're showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable price. This price is also a good balance between saving money and potentially closing the deal before we run out of rounds."
