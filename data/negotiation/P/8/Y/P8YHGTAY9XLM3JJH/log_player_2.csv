# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worth my while.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While you can try to negotiate further, Alice has already come down a significant amount. Accepting her offer at $1,075,000 still saves you money compared to buying from John, and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a higher price."
