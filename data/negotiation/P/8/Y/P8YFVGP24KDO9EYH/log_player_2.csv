"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you at a price significantly lower than its true worth. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a chance to secure a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested. I understand if it doesn't fit your current needs, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
