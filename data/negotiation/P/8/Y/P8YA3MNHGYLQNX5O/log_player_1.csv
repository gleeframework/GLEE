Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming higher.  Bob's clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob's latest offer is getting close enough to my minimum. Continuing to push might make him walk away, and I'd rather secure a good deal now than risk losing him. $1,340,000 is a good return."
