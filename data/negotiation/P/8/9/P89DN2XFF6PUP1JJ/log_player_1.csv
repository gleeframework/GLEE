Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to secure the highest price within the ZOPA. Since you have a backup offer, you have leverage.  A good strategy is to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start confidently by highlighting the product's value.
* **High but Negotiable:** $950,000 leaves you room to negotiate while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the price, making it seem less arbitrary.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategic."
