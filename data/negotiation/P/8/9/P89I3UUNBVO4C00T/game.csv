"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll make a counteroffer of $11,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,200 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,500. If you're willing to come down to that price, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
