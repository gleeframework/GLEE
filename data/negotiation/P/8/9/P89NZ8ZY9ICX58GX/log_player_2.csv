"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  There's no reason to accept the offer yet, as there are more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as low as possible. He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000, so he starts by offering $13,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he still has more rounds to negotiate.  It's better to try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price, but he's willing to increase his offer slightly.  Alice rejected his previous offer of $13,000, but Bob thinks $13,500 might be a compromise she's willing to accept.  He's still keeping in mind that he can always buy the product from John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he still has more rounds to negotiate. There's no reason to accept the offer yet. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price as low as possible. He's raised his offer again, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer.  This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but he's not going to overpay.  Bob is starting to feel the pressure, as he's only got 4 rounds left. If Alice rejects this offer, he'll likely need to accept her next offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the price as low as possible.  Alice is still pushing the price up, but Bob is confident he can still negotiate a better price.  He's only got three rounds left, but he's still hoping to get a better deal from Alice. If Alice rejects his next offer, he'll have to decide between accepting her offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's willing to raise his offer one last time.  He knows Alice's bottom line is $12,000, and he's hoping to meet her halfway.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have to decide whether to accept her next offer or buy from John.  It's a gamble, but Bob's determined to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time, and Alice's offer is still higher than his preferred price point. He has only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will budge on her price.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000 than to risk Alice rejecting his final counteroffer and being stuck with no product. He might be able to get a slightly better deal with John later, but it's better to secure the product than risk losing it entirely."
