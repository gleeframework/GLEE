"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if he can get a price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's valuation as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to buy while leaving space for Alice to counter with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is a significant improvement over the initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a better deal. There's still room for negotiation, and with only 7 rounds remaining, it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $850,000, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. $860,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's a step closer to a potential agreement. The goal is to secure a deal in the next few rounds before needing to resort to John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $870,000 is only $10,000 higher than Bob's previous offer, indicating that they are close to a deal.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate and not reaching an agreement is higher. It's a good deal for Bob, and accepting the offer ensures he gets the product for a price lower than John's $1,000,000 offer."
