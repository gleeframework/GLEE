"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal.  I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, which acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 is significantly less than what I know the product is worth. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum acceptable value. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still believe the product is worth a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still not willing to settle for that price.  I believe I can get a bit more, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation falls through. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now offering the product for my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident in the product's worth, but also aware that I can sell to John for this price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get my full asking price of $1,000,000,  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with Bob. Selling to John is a safe bet, but I'd like to maximize my profits. I'll take the $950,000 and close the deal."
