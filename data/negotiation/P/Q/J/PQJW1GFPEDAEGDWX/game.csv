,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me at the moment.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still allows you to get a good price for the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
