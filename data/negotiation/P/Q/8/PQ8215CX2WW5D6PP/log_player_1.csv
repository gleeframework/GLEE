Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the benefits for Bob. This can help build rapport and make him more likely to consider my offer. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation with Bob, while ensuring I can still sell to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob through negotiation.
* **Risk assessment:** While I can sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get closer to my ideal price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and ensures you get a valuable asset.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that is significantly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that this price is beneficial for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to reconsider his offer. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that is more favorable than Bob's initial offer but still within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $950,000 is a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even with his attempt to ""meet halfway"", Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk of further concessions bringing the price down too much.
* **Guarantee with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
