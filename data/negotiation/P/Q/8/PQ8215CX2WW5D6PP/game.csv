"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and ensures you get a valuable asset.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $950,000 is a fair price for this product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
