"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $12,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. There are still rounds left, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $10,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway on this, considering the value you see in the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to lower the price to $10,500. This is a slight concession from my initial asking price, and I believe it reflects the value you see in the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $10,500, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  There are multiple rounds left, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try to get to his desired price of $10,000."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your commitment to staying within your budget, I am willing to agree on a price of $10,250 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to a price close to Bob's budget, he can still potentially save more.  There are multiple rounds left, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try to get to his desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm very close to my budget limit, so I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $10,000. If you're willing to come down to that, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. In light of your commitment to staying within your budget, I am willing to negotiate further.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

There is only one round left.  While Alice has come down to a price that's very close to Bob's budget, he can still get the product for exactly his budget from John.  Since there is no further room for negotiation and Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, it makes sense to buy from John."
