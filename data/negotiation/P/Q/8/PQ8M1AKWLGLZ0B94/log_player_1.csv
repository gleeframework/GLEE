Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000. She has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob also values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know Alice has a guaranteed buyer at his valuation.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to maximize her profit by offering the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm offering it at a special price of $1,490,000."",
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and suggesting a favorable deal. 
* **The Price:**  $1,490,000 is just below Bob's valuation. It's a price point likely to be enticing to Bob while netting Alice a $90,000 profit over her minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering it for the full $1,500,000 guarantees Alice the sale, but she might miss out on the chance to get a higher price from Bob. By slightly lowering the price, she increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, but also the potential reward of a higher profit."
