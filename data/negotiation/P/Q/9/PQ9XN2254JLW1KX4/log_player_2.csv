**Reasoning:**  Alice seems firm on a price around $110, and she's unlikely to go much lower. At this point, further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and it risks the deal falling through entirely. It's more strategic to secure the product from John at $120, ensuring you get it and avoiding potential wasted time with further haggling."
