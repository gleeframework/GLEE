Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $1,150,000 still yields a much higher profit than selling to John at $1,000,000."
