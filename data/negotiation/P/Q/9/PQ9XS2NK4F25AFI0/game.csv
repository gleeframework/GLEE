"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice. How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I can do $12,500, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
