"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $8,000. You have the opportunity to negotiate further and try to get a better deal with Alice, or you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above my target price of $8,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while also showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$11,000 is still too high for me. I can continue to negotiate with Alice or go with John if I don't get a better price. I'm not desperate for this product and have another option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price but still remain below my maximum limit. I believe this will push Alice towards accepting a deal. If she rejects it again, I'll consider going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my target price, it's still a significant amount over my $8,000 limit. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she has already rejected my counteroffers. This gives me more leverage. If she continues to be stubborn, I'll be ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This time, I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway and am getting closer to her expectations. It's still a significant saving for me compared to her previous offers. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll be ready to go with John.  I'm also trying to gauge how much she's willing to lower her price. If she rejects again, I'm almost certain I'll be able to get the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging on her price, and her offer of $12,500 is far too high for me. At this point, it's clear that I won't be able to negotiate a price that fits my budget. It's better for me to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for $8,000.  I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Alice, and it's time to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
