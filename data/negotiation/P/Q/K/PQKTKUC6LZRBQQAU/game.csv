"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to explore this opportunity in more detail.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. After considering its value and my budget, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I appreciate your understanding and look forward to continuing our discussion.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. While I'm keen to find a solution that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is below my threshold.  Could you consider $1,350,000?  This reflects a significant reduction on my initial price and still recognizes the true worth of what's on offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,350,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
