Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you, for $13,500.  It's a fantastic deal for something that can do [mention a key benefit of the product and how it specifically helps Bob].  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible to maximize profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation if needed.  
* **Highlight Value:** Mentioning a key benefit tailored to Bob's needs reinforces the product's value and justifies the price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** Offering a price closer to $15,000 might make Bob completely walk away, while going too low leaves money on the table. $13,500 strikes a balance.

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
