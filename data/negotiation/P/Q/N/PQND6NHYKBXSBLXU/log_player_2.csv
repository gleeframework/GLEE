"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe it will bring a lot of value to your business. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her own valuation, so there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be happy to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that my product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I might end up paying more if I go with John.  Accepting this offer is the best option for securing the product at a reasonable price."
