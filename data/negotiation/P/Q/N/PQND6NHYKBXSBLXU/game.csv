"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be happy to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that my product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
