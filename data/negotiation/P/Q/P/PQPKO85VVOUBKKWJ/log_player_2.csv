"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a lower price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and also saves you money compared to buying from John."
