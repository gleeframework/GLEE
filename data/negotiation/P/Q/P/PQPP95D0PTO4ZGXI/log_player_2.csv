"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate to try to get a better price.  He still has options to get the product for less than Alice's offer, and it's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her previous offer, it is still above Bob's desired price range. Bob should continue negotiating to try and lower the price even further. He has a safety net of buying from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this offer is fair, considering the product's value and my budget. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is still slightly above your maximum offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still outside of it.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000. This secures the product for Bob at a lower price, saving him $120,000 compared to Alice's current offer.  The potential of further negotiation with Alice is outweighed by the certainty of getting the product at a lower price from John."
