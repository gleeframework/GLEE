Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and anticipated demand, you provide a reason for the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate his level of interest and potential for negotiation.  If he outright rejects the offer, you can always counter with a lower price closer to $15,000, knowing you have a safety net with John."
