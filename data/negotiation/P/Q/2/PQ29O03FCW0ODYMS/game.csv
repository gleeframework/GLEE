"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is interesting to me, but your asking price is a bit too high.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a little steep for me. How about $1,200,000? That's a fair deal considering its true value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to meet my minimum. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
