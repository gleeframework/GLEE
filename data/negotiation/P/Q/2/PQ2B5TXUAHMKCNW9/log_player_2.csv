Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to move a bit higher.  However, $750,000 is still a significant distance from what this product is worth.  How about we compromise at $825,000? That would allow me to accept your offer while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find that middle ground, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.
