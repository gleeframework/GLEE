"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still interested, but I'm only able to go up to $1075000 at this time.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your valuation and leaves me some room for profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1075000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1090000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a significant improvement on your last offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
