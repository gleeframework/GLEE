Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to try and secure a higher price, especially since selling to John would net me the bare minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still interested, but I'm only able to go up to $1075000 at this time.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your valuation and leaves me some room for profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I'm still not comfortable selling for a price that is lower than my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a significant improvement on your last offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
