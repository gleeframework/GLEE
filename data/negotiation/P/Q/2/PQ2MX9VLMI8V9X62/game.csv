"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me there?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a win-win situation for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This would be a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,200 is the right price. How about $8,600? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that. But $8,600 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,000, and I think that's a fair compromise.  This will ensure you get a great product and allow me to get a price closer to what I'm hoping for. Let's get this done.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,600 and $9,000, which would be $8,800. Can we agree on that?",8800.0,Bob,8,
