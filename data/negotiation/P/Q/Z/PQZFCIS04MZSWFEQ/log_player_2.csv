"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at $15,000.  Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, you maintain the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future or explore other options."
