"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While accepting Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more expensive than what the product is worth to you. By rejecting, you have a chance to negotiate further with Alice or potentially find an even better deal elsewhere."
