"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not comfortable going below $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $97.50 is still a little high for me. Let's try $92.50.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I'll love the product.",92.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $95. How about we meet in the middle again at $93.75? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it.",93.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again, but $93.75 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to lose this deal. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $92. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm not comfortable selling it to you for less. How about we meet in the middle one more time at $91.50? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it.",91.5,Alice,9,
