"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to get the price as close to his $80 limit as possible without risking losing the deal.  $85 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but not so low that it's immediately insulting or likely to be rejected outright.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and open to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has lowered her price, $100 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's room for Alice to come down further, and it's worth trying to get a better deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While John is a backup option, Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, as he might be able to secure a better price than John's $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, suggesting he's serious about buying the product.
* **Staying Within Budget:** $90 is still within Bob's acceptable range, but it's closer to his limit than Alice's last offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on fairness and a mutual benefit, making it more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not comfortable going below $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $97.5 is still above Bob's budget of $80.  While Alice has come down significantly, it's not enough to make the deal worth it for Bob at this point.
* **Negotiating Room:** Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's room for Alice to compromise further, and there's no guarantee that John's price won't go up if Bob waits too long.
* **Balancing Risk:** Bob needs to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Alice against the potential for a better deal.  He should continue negotiating while still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $97.50 is still a little high for me. Let's try $92.50.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident I'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Bob is showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still pushing for a lower price.
* **Small but Significant Drop:** $92.5 is a small step down from Alice's offer, but it keeps the negotiation moving in the right direction.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes fairness and confidence in the product, making it more likely Alice will see Bob's offer as a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $95. How about we meet in the middle again at $93.75? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $93.75 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has made concessions, but Bob still has room to negotiate.  There's a possibility she might come down further.
* **Balancing Risk:**  Bob needs to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Alice against the potential for a better deal. He should continue negotiating while still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again, but $93.75 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to lose this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** Bob is making a final push to get the price down to a level he can comfortably afford.

* **Appealing to Reason:**  The message focuses on fairness and the potential for losing the deal, appealing to Alice's sense of compromise. 
* **Staying Within Budget:**  This is Bob's last offer within his acceptable range, so he's taking a calculated risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $92. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm not comfortable selling it to you for less. How about we meet in the middle one more time at $91.50? It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who will truly appreciate it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Budget Limit:** $91.5 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Alice has shown a reluctance to go below $92, making further negotiation seem unlikely.
* **Time Constraint:** With only one round left, there's not enough time to potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Secure Deal:**  By buying from John, Bob can secure the product for $80, which is within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
