,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $12,100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,300, which is a fair compromise. If we can reach an agreement, I'm ready to close the deal today.",12300.0,Alice,7,
