"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I could consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do it for $7,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $9,500 is my final offer â€“ it's a great deal for the value you're getting.",9500.0,Alice,5,
