"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far above your maximum price. It's essential to negotiate the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I could consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than you're ultimately willing to pay. This creates room for bargaining.
* **Signaling Interest:** Offering $6,000 shows you're serious about purchasing but also establishes a firm lower boundary.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  If she outright rejects this offer, it might be challenging to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still significantly more than your ideal price and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice moving from $20,000 to $13,000 indicates a willingness to negotiate.  There's likely room to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $8,000.  This should factor into how much you're willing to concede."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do it for $7,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to your $8,000 maximum, but we don't want to jump there immediately. $7,500 shows flexibility while still leaving room to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** By suggesting it's a fair deal for both parties, you create a more collaborative tone, potentially making Alice more receptive.
* **Time Pressure:**  While not explicitly stated, every counteroffer implies the alternative (buying from John) is becoming more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $9,500 is my final offer â€“ it's a great deal for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Worth It:** $9,500 is getting close to your maximum budget, but Alice has declared it her ""final offer."" This suggests she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **John's Price is Better:**  The difference between Alice's final offer and John's price is significant enough ($1,500) to justify buying from John. 
* **Avoiding Further Haggling:** You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Buying from John avoids potentially frustrating haggling that might not result in a significantly better price from Alice."
