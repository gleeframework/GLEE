"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly higher than her estimated worth of $800,000.  There is room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price point. I'm willing to pay closer to my initial counteroffer of $750,000, and I think there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter again and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
