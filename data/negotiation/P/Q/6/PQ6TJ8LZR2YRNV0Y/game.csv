"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, so I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
