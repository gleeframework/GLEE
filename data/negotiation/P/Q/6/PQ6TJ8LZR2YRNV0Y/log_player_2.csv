# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can see that you're serious about buying the product, so I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for you. You're getting the product for $250,000 less than your maximum price and Alice is making a profit. Holding out for a lower price is risky, especially since Alice stated this is her final offer."
