"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $90, so I'm offering it to you for $92.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting quite close to what I had in mind.  Would you accept $91?",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $91, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value out of the deal. How about we compromise at $91.25? It's just a tiny bit more, but I think it's worth it.",91.25,Alice,7,
