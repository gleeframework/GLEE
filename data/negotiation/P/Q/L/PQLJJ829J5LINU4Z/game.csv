"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the counteroffer. However,  $1,075,000 is still slightly lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  If you can meet me at $1,125,000, I'd be happy to finalize the sale.  This represents a good compromise for both of us. Let's get this done.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final concession, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest price I can afford and still make a profit.
