"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make it work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still significantly higher than what I had in mind. If you're serious about selling, I could consider $700,000. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground here. While $700,000 is too low, I'm willing to consider a significant reduction to $1,400,000. This offer takes into account your interest while reflecting the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  I'd be willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,6,
