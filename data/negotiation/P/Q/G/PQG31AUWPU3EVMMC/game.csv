"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $700,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $750,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $775,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about splitting the difference and settling at $762,500?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",762500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to split the difference, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",775000.0,Alice,7,
