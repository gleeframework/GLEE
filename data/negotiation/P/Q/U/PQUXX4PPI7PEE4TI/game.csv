"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
