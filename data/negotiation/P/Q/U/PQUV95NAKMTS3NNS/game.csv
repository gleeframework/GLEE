"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit from the product's potential. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
