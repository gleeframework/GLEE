{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $90? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would work for me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and the counter.  I can tell you're interested!  I could go down to $105, but that's the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $105, which is more than I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100."
