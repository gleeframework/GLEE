{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?"",

}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional value"" to justify the high price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more confident approach with Bob."
