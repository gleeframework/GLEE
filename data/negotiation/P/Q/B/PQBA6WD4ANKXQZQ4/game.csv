"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? That's the highest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
