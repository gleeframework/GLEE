Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value but allows for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and inviting.** It acknowledges Bob's potential interest and positions the product as valuable.
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * **Maximize profit:**  A $10,000 sale is closer to your desired $12,000.
    * **Open a dialogue:**  It sets the stage for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 
    * **Maintain the John option:** If Bob rejects, you can still move to John for your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**
* **While selling to John for $12,000 is an attractive option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.**  
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer.**  You can try to bridge the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  That's a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  This counteroffer bridges the gap between your initial $10,000 offer and Bob's $8,000 offer.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see your offer as reasonable.
* **Maintain flexibility:** The message also leaves the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? That's the highest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**
* **While further negotiation is possible, the risk of continuing is high.** There's a chance Bob will simply refuse to budge, leaving you with a lower sale price than you desire. 
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is the most profitable option at this point.** It ensures you get your minimum acceptable price without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
