It's not a good deal for Bob. He can get the same product from John for less. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should reject the offer. While $8,500 is closer to his maximum price, he can still get the same product from John for $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as there is still a potential for a better deal."
