Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much lower.  You've made a good effort to negotiate, but it's getting close to your limit.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
