"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us - I get a good price, and you get a product that's worth more to you than you're paying for. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
