"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point. However, I'm looking to secure this product at a price closer to $850,000. This reflects my understanding of the market value and would make this a mutually beneficial deal. I'm confident we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the value that this product holds for me, and I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $880,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. $880,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still aiming to secure the product at $860,000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with a fair deal. Let's work towards a compromise that benefits us both.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering $880,000, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $870,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",870000.0,Alice,5,
