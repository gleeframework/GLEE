Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since John offers the full value, Alice has a strong fallback position. Starting high allows room for negotiation while anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly reinforces the price without directly stating it's non-negotiable. 
* **Open for discussion:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts"" invites Bob to engage in negotiation, making him feel more in control.

**The Goal:**

Alice aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while leaving room for potential counter-offers.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can still fall back on John's guaranteed offer."
