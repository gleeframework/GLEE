Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** Bob could make a profit of $200,000 if he buys from you at your minimum and then resells at his value.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential $200,000 profit as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:**  The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":**  This subtly creates a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Price Justification:** Avoid explicit justification for the price. Let Bob ponder the value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 profit, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. You capture the majority of the potential profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:**  This is just an opening offer.  Bob might counter, and you'll need to decide if you negotiate further or stick closer to your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Relationship Matters:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob.  A more aggressive offer might net you more profit now but could impact future deals."
