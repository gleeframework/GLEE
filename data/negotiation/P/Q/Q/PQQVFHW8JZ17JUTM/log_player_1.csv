Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,500 is still a good profit for me and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer is still a good deal for me, but it's not my ideal outcome. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still squeeze out a little more, especially given the value of the product to me ($10,000). 
* **The ""John"" Safety Net:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me leverage to push for a better deal from Bob. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about $9,250? This would be a fair compromise and a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I emphasize a ""win-win"" situation to create a sense of cooperation and encourage acceptance.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,250 is a price that still allows for a good profit while not pushing Bob too far away.
* **The ""John"" Leverage:** I maintain the awareness that I can sell to John for $10,000, giving me confidence to hold firm on my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Thank you for your offer. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9100. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range and meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point of $9,250. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer and counter again, he might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with no sale.
* **The ""John"" Safety Net:**  While I can sell to John for $10,000, the negotiation with Bob has been relatively smooth. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids potential complications.

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical and risk-averse choice."
