"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and the offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than $10,000.  I could consider letting it go for $19,000.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, $13,000 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I could go down to $17,000, but that's my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to come down to $14,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
