Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and the offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than $10,000.  I could consider letting it go for $19,000."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $19,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, $13,000 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I could go down to $17,000, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. If you're willing to come down to $14,000, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Explanation: Bob is very unlikely to go above $14,000. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
