Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
