"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, but I need to be certain this price reflects the actual value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm confident that the product's value to you is indeed $1200000. Considering your offer of $1050000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has essentially repeated her initial offer. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and a slight reduction in price shows good faith.  There's still room to bargain, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I understand your value for the product is $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. Considering your last offer of $1075000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1095000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has finally moved closer to Bob's preferred price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a little more negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob's time running out outweighs the potential savings.
* **Cost of John:**  Buying from John is $15,000 more expensive than Alice's current offer. 

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations."
