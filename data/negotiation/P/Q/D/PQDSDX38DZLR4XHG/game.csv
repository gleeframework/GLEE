"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1200000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1050000, but I need to be certain this price reflects the actual value for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm confident that the product's value to you is indeed $1200000. Considering your offer of $1050000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I understand your value for the product is $1000000. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. Considering your last offer of $1075000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1095000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1095000.0,Alice,5,
