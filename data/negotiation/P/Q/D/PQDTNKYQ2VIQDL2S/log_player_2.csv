"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $9,500 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate, as Alice values the product at $8,000. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** You have a safety net with John's offer of $10,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and shows a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Keep it under your budget:**  This price remains within your $10,000 limit.
* **Show flexibility:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's a compromise, $9,250 is still outside my comfort zone. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** Having John's offer as a fallback gives me the confidence to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  Let's try $9,100.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant reduction:** $9,100 is a small decrease from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reasoning and justification:** The message explains my perspective, highlighting the value of the product while emphasizing my need for a lower price.
* **Staying under budget:** This price keeps me within my $10,000 limit."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $9,150.  I believe this reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my budget:** $9,150 is very close to my maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Possible deal:**  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and this offer is reasonable.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk Alice walking away or John changing his offer.

**The risk of continuing:**  While I could try to get a slightly lower price, it's possible Alice will be unwilling to budge further.  I'd rather secure the product at a price that's within my budget than risk losing the deal altogether."
