"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but unfortunately, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to simply purchase the product from John for $10,000, as it's the best deal he can get within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of going over budget isn't worth it."
