"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think you're a serious buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no incentive to accept right away. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still higher than you want to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to invest in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your preferred price point, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better offer. At this point,  $1,300,000 is a good deal considering:

* **You save $200,000** compared to buying from John.
* **Alice is firm on her price**, suggesting further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **You still have a good margin** within your budget.

It's a good time to accept and secure the product."
