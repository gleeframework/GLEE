{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for some give-and-take. It's also a good opening statement that emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the value you have for the product. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is close enough to my minimum of $80 and is also a good price for him. I'll accept his offer."
