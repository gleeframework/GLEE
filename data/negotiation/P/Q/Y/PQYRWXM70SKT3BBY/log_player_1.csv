Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so this is a good starting point.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's proposal, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,800,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully will encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting too low for my liking. I'm not comfortable with the price dropping any further and risking a loss. John's offer is still a good deal,  and selling to him will guarantee my minimum profit."
