{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered the price, $17,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise given the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we might not reach a mutually acceptable price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John for my target price of $10,000."
