"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise given the value to both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
