"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to the middle of our perceived values. This should give Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000?  This gives you a significant discount, and leaves me room to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is tempting, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. There are still a few rounds left, so I'm going to try and negotiate a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,250 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,625? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product. Let's reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $11,437.50?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,437.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've been pushing for a higher price, but Bob's counteroffer is getting close to my acceptable range. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer secures a sale for a decent profit."
