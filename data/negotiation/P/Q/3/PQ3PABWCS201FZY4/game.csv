"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $12,000?  This gives you a significant discount, and leaves me room to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,250 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,625? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal on this product. Let's reach an agreement!",11625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $11,437.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",11437.5,Bob,6,
