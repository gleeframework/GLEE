Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers to you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits,"" framing the price as justified. 
* **Alternative:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a fallback option ensuring you meet your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
