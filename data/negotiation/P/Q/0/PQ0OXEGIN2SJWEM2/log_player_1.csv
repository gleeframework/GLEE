I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$900,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $1,200,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth significantly more. Hopefully, this encourages Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's offer is still too low.  It seems like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  I'm going to sell the product to John and guarantee myself at least my minimum price."
