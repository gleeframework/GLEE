Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. Offering it for $115 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a profit for me.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I've started at $115, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, and I can slightly reduce the price if needed, staying above my minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
