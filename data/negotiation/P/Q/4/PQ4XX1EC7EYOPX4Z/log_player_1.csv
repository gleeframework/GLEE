``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to him, making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $10,500 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?  That would make it a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
