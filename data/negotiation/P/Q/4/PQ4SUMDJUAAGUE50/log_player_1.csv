Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value creates a win-win situation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a comfortable margin for you above your minimum while still saving Bob $100,000 compared to his perceived value. This makes it highly likely he'll accept.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($1,200,000) is crucial.
* **Relationship:** While aiming for the best price, consider the long-term implications if you drive too hard a bargain and sour the potential relationship with Bob."
