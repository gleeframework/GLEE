Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
