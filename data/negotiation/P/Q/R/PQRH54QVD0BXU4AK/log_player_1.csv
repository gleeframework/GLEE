Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob provides leverage. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above John's offer. 
* **Open Communication:** The message aims for a collaborative tone, inviting Bob to discuss the price and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, starting with a strong initial price maximizes the potential earnings."
