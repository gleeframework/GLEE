Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm initially offering it at $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start higher with Bob.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. If he flat out rejects the $20,000, you can lower the price and still potentially get a better deal than $15,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""interest"" aims to create a sense of desirability and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob closer to your desired price range."
