Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  This initial offer is not my absolute minimum, so I have space to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage."
