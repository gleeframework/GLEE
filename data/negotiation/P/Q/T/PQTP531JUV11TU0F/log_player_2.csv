Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is within your budget of $15,000 and represents a significant discount from her initial price. It's a good deal, and you should accept it to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the product.  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower."
