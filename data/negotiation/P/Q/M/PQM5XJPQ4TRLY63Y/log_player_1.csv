Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its uniqueness, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $12000 on this purchase. Would you consider accepting such an offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I still believe that $12000 is the most I could realistically pay. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for $14,500.  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  John's offer is also very close, but I think I can get a better deal with Bob if I keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $14,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $16,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I would like to counter with $15000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is equal to John's offer.  While I would like to get more,  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds. It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it."
