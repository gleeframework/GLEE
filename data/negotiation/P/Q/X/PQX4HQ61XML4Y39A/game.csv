"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,500?  That would make this a viable deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend on this product.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
