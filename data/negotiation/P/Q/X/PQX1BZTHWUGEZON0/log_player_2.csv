"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's a better price than John's offer. It's also a good compromise considering Alice has already lowered her price from $10,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money and secures the product."
