**Explanation:**  It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you have no information about Alice's bottom line. There's a chance you could get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

**Explanation:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $1,000,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a good price, but also signals that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  This gives us room to bargain."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:** I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  Hopefully, this is a good middle ground that will lead to a deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is getting close to my desired price point.  I'm running out of rounds, and while I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she'll become less flexible or I'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
