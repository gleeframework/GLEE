"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is offering it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You're guaranteed to get the product for your maximum price with John."
