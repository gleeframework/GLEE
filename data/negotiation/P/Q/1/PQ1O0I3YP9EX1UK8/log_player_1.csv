"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not desperate to sell to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum.  This product is worth every penny, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it in your hands.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
