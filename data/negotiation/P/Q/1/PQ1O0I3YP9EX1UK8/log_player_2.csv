"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my maximum budget.  I need to negotiate to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  lowering the price by $400,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,000,000 limit as possible, but I'm willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum.  This product is worth every penny, and I'm sure you'll agree once you have it in your hands.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I would ideally pay less, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product. Accepting this offer means I get the product at my limit, which is a good outcome."
