Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm afraid $550,000 is a bit too low for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $630,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $660,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're now within a reasonable range.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll become less flexible as we get closer to her bottom line.  Accepting at $660,000 secures a good deal on a valuable product."
