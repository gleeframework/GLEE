"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  It's a reasonable opening given we know the product's worth to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $80 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $95?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll counter with a price closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need a fair price, Alice. How about we settle on $87? That's a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 87
}
```

We're moving closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and her last offer. This shows we're willing to negotiate, but we're also holding firm on getting a good deal."
