{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **You have 9 more rounds.**  There's no need to rush into a decision.  You have time to explore better options. 
* **The John offer is your fallback.** Knowing you have a guaranteed option for $8,000 gives you leverage in negotiating with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Testing Alice's bottom line:** This counteroffer will gauge how close Alice is to her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $6,000 is still lower than Alice's latest offer, suggesting there's still room for both parties to find a middle ground.

* **Assessing Alice's urgency:**  This counteroffer tests how motivated Alice is to close the deal before you potentially walk away to buy from John. 
* **Preparing for a potential compromise:** If Alice is willing to meet you halfway, you're likely to reach a deal.  However, if she rejects this offer, you're ready to buy from John in the next round."

* **Time is running out:**  You only have one round left, so you can't risk further negotiation and potentially end up with no product at all.

It's better to secure the product from John, as it's the most certain way to get what you want within your budget."
