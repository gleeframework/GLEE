"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to buy the product for as little as possible, and you have a maximum budget of $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice. It allows you to get the product within your budget.  Buying from John would cost you the same amount."
