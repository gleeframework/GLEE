"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover my costs for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
