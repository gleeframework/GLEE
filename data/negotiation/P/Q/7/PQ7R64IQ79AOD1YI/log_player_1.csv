"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,250,000 is still too low, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover my costs for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,312,500?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm getting closer to my desired amount.  $1,312,500 is a reasonable offer that ensures a profitable sale without risking a stalemate and losing Bob as a buyer."
