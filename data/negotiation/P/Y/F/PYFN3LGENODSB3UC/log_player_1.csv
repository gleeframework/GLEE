Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $100 for it. It's a great deal, so let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a chance to see what Bob's value for the product might be. I'm also trying to create a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
