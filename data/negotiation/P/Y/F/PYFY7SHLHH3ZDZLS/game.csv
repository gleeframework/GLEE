"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I think you might be that buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $700000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $650000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  I believe this is a win-win scenario. What do you say?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
