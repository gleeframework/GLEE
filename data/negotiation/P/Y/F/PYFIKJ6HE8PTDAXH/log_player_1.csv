``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below what the product is worth to you, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable price for Bob, giving him a potential $100,000 in savings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While I want to sell, I'm not willing to give up that much profit. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That gives you a substantial discount and leaves me with a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $975,000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to a price I'd be comfortable with, $975,000 is still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if we can't reach a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If you're serious about this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
