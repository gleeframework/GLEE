"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That gives you a substantial discount and leaves me with a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. How about $975,000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
