Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly justify the high price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer will help you understand how interested Bob truly is. If he accepts, you get a great deal. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually beneficial price. If he rejects outright, you have John as a backup."
