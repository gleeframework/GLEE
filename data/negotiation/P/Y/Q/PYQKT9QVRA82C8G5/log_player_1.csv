Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
