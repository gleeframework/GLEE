"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we settle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
