"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation. You value the product at $15,000 and Alice is willing to sell it for $10,000. This indicates there's a potential for a price closer to $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial asking price.  However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves Alice with a profit margin. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that I'll end up paying more with John. Accepting this offer secures the product at a fair price."
