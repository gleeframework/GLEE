Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to find a deal, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can consider. If we're going to make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $1,075,000. This reflects the value I'm confident this product will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,075,000, and saving the extra $75,000 is a significant amount."
