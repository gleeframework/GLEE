Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning that Bob would ""really enjoy it"" subtly implies the product's value without explicitly stating it. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a higher price, while still having room to negotiate if needed. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on selling to John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. Bob's counteroffer is at my minimum, leaving no room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob!  I appreciate the offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of going straight to my minimum, I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and increases the chances of finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and focused on the product's value, aiming to make Bob feel valued and more likely to agree. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it still leaves space for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While $85 isn't ideal, it's only $5 less than my minimum and is a better price than I can get from John.  Considering the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a stalemate, it's wiser to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
