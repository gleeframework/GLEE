"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825,000.
