"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $8,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to meet in the middle.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit. This price reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us to both reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
