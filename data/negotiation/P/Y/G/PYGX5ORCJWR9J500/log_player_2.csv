"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired maximum. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
