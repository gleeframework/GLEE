Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is too low for me to consider. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $14,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick to that figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at $14,000, which is significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer substantially, and continuing the negotiation risks a lower final sale price. Selling to John ensures the best possible outcome at this point."
