Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If not, I can always lower the price or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to get the most out of the sale, $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum value. While I'd like to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially get a worse offer. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to gamble with Bob."
