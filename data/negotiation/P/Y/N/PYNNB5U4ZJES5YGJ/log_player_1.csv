I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit. I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make significantly more than $1,000,000 to justify selling the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price, showing that I'm not desperate to sell.  I hope this will encourage Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a deal.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's not worth risking the deal completely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the safest option at this point."
