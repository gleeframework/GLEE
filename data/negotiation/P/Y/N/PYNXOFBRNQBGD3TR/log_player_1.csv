Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit while leaving room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder initial offer to Bob.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** The message doesn't explicitly state it's a final offer, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach an even better deal."
