"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in your industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950000 is a bit high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $700000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. This is my best price for now, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $825000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000 again, but this time it's non-negotiable. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $825000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and get this deal done.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $775000, which is $800000. I'm now offering the product to you for $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $800000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking to get this deal done at a slightly lower price.  How about we meet in the middle at $787500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away happy.",787500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your target price, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm now going to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer: I'll sell the product to you for $795000. This is my absolute final price, and I won't negotiate further.",795000.0,Alice,9,
