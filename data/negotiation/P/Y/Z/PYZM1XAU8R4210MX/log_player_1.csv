Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still above Bob's value for the product.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Value proposition:**  Mentioning the product's usefulness reinforces its worth and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've made a good profit while still maintaining a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on its value and my desire to sell to him versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a bit more than that, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown interest and a willingness to pay more, indicating that there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time investment:** It's worth investing a little more time to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Assess John:** I'll also consider the value of John's offer, as it provides a benchmark for my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" for both of us, highlighting mutual benefit and encouraging acceptance.
* **Confidence in the product:**  Reiterating the product's value helps justify the price.

**Next steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and make a decision based on his offer and the value of John's offer. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider my options.  I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer if necessary, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a good compromise, considering the back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting Bob's offer keeps the relationship positive, potentially leading to future transactions where I can sell at a higher price. 
* **Time investment:** It's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob when I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John.

**Next steps:**

* **Closing the deal:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Future opportunities:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind for future sales, but I'm also open to potentially working with Bob again if he shows interest in future purchases."
