Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly inching towards a more reasonable price.  I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more, knowing I have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: $105, and that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm drawing a line in the sand here. This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal. If Bob rejects this, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher than $95. While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are minimal. Accepting his $95 offer is only a marginal improvement over John's guaranteed $100. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit."
