"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you'd be gaining.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That being said, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the inherent value of this product. I respect your approach to this negotiation, so I'm prepared to make another adjustment.  How about $1,275,000? This represents a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
