"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point seems a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me partway there, Alice.  However, $700,000 is still a bit too steep for me. To make this work, I can do $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to go down to $650,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $625,000?  That's my final offer.",625000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $630,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",630000.0,Alice,7,
