Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

While Alice met me halfway, I can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it's in my best interest to take the guaranteed savings."
