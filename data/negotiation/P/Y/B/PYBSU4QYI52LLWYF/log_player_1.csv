Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

This strategy prioritizes potential profit from Bob without risking the guaranteed sale to John."
