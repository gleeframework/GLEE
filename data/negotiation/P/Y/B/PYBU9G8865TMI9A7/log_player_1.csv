Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be a great addition to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the potential benefit he'd gain from acquiring it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a backup plan with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. There's potential to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible. I'd be open to selling it for $850,000. This price reflects the significant value the product offers and also allows you to stay within a reasonable range.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counteroffering at $850,000, which is halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for the price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by stating ""Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by lowering my price, but it increases the likelihood of a deal with Bob.  My backup plan with John provides security if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for being flexible, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a quick deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer would close the deal quickly, saving time and effort.
* **Uncertainty with John:** While I have John as a backup, there's no guarantee he'll still be interested if I reject Bob's offer. There's a risk of losing both buyers.

**Considering the potential risks and rewards, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible decision at this point.**"
