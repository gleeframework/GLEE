"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 on this product.  It's a fair price given its value to me, and I believe it's a starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to you and is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $800,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This price is still a significant discount from the original price and reflects the value of the product to you. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to finalize the deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
