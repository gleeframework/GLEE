"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum. This allows some room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell yet. I'll see if I can get a better price by counter-offering. There's still time to get a better deal with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for the minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept at this point. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can push him higher.  I also have the option of selling to John, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $125. This is a strong offer that's close to my minimum but still provides some profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and we are getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm no longer confident that I can get a better price from Bob. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
