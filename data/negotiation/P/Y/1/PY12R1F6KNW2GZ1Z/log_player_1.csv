"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to secure a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price higher than what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit, which is a good outcome."
