"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $12,000 John is asking, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. It's beneficial for Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $9,250 is still more than Bob is comfortable paying. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to try and save even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $9,000? It's closer to your offer and still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get it for a bit less, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $9100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $9100. This is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,100, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget and significantly lower than the $12,000 he would have to pay John. Accepting the offer is the best option for Bob as it allows him to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
