"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this is reflective of its value and the benefit it will bring you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500?  That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. To be transparent, I have another offer for $10,000.  I'm willing to close with you for $10,500 as a final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
