"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase [product description] for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal for you, as you know the value is $1,200,000. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000, so time is of the essence. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  There's no need to spend an extra $200,000. Alice is using a common sales tactic by mentioning another buyer to create urgency, but you have a better alternative."
