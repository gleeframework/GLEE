"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $80 to you, so accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?

You have three options:

While $105 is better than $120, it's still over your $80 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.

Alice's offer of $100 is still above your $80 limit. You've already negotiated a few rounds and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $80 and save yourself the further negotiation."
