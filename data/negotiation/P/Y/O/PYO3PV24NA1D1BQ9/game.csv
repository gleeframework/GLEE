"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
