"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  To show you my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows you to get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is only $50,000 more than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  Accepting this offer is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly better than buying from John.  There is still a chance that Bob could negotiate further, but it's risky.  At this point, it's a good idea to secure the deal and avoid any potential complications."
