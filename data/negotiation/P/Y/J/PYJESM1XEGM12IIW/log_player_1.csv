Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed, but also maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and invites Bob's feedback, suggesting a willingness to negotiate.

By starting high and gauging Bob's reaction, you can adjust your strategy. If he outright rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John."
