"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $11,000 is only $500 more than Bob's ideal price of $10,500.
* **The risk of rejection is high:** If Bob rejects again, Alice might increase the price again or walk away entirely. 
* **John's price is a fallback:** If the negotiation with Alice fails, Bob can still get the product from John for $12,000.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
