"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the significant value this product brings to your business, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is a fair compromise. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer demonstrates a serious commitment to making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can close this quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. It's also getting close to my desired price range, and I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation."
