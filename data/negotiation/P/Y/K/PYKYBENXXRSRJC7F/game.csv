"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum, as I'm also considering other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is my best and final compromise for this round.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go up a bit. However, $1400000 is still out of my reach. I can offer $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1000000 is still below my minimum price. I'm starting to think that we might not be on the same page. However, I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1300000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and offer $1150000.  This shows my commitment to finding a solution, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $1150000 is still below my minimum price. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
