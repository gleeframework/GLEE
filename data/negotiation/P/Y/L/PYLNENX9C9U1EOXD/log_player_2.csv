"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still gives you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
