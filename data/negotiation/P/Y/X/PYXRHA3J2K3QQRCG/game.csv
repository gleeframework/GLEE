"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential value, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which reflects a considerable compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair and represents the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  Let's try to close the deal at a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1225000 for the product.  I'm confident that this price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1225000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute limit. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept $1212500 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1212500.0,Alice,7,
