,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",135.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,145.0
"I can see you're willing to go up to $135, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can meet you at $145, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $145 is still a little more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller at this point.",140.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,142.5
"I understand you're considering other options, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $145, which is $142.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,7,,
