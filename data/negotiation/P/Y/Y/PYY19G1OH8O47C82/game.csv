,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $110 is a little low for me, considering what this product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $120.  That way, we both get a fair price and we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
