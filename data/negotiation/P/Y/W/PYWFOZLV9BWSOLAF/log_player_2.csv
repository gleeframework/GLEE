Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already come down $50000 from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll counteroffer $1075000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and we're getting close to our target price.

Accepting this offer ensures we get the product at a good price and avoid any potential risks."
