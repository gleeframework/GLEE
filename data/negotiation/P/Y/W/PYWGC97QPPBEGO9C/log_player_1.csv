Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 offer:**  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the perceived value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  By starting high, I aim for a higher selling price.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  A friendly approach and a reasonable starting point make Bob more likely to engage in a negotiation.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum price ($100)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $65 is more than Bob's perceived value of $80, it is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, aiming to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $90, which is closer to Bob's perceived value ($80) but still above my minimum price ($100).
* **Positive message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There is still some room to negotiate further if needed.

**Strategy:**

My aim is to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell below $100, so $90 is a good starting point.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a lower price, I'm showing willingness to compromise and keeping Bob engaged.
* **Stay flexible:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still lower my price slightly to potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  I could do $75, how does that sound? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of wasting time and potentially not getting a better offer.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and meets my minimum requirement."
