"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a little bit. Would you consider $105? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? This would be a fair price for both of us.",101.0,Alice,5,
