# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've given it some thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a great price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You're better off rejecting the offer and securing a better deal with John."
