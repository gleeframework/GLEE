"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's something that I've priced competitively at $1,000,000, considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for your business.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** Her message is clearly designed to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting. The mention of another buyer at $800,000 (her product's worth to her) is a classic negotiation tactic.
* **You have a fallback option:**  You know John will sell you the product for $1,200,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for further negotiation. She might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
