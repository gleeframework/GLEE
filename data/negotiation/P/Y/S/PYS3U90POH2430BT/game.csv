"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I see you're willing to negotiate, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be open to $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $760,000?  That's a serious offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, which is just a slight adjustment from your last offer. I think this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,7,
