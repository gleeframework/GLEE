"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
