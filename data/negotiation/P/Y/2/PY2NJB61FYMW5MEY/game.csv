"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer that reflects its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
