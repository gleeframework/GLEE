"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I see the value, $11,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price is still a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. ",10750.0,Bob,6,
