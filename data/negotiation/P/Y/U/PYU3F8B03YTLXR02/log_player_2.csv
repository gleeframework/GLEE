{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is now offering $118. You are willing to pay up to $120, so while you could continue to negotiate, you're only saving $2. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations and possibly failing to reach an agreement. At this point, it's better to buy from John and get the product."
