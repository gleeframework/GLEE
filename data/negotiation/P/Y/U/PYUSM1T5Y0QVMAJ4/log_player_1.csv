{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Time Value & Alternative:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.  A slightly lower price to Bob might be advantageous if it leads to a quicker sale."
