"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It exceeds your budget of $100.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There are 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to lower the price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** Starting at $80 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired $100.
* **Avoiding John:**  The goal is to get a better deal than John's $100, so it's important to continue negotiating with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While she's moved closer to your desired price, $115 is still above your budget.
* **There's still potential for a better deal.** You've shown willingness to negotiate, and with 8 rounds left, you can continue pushing for a lower price.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.**  If the negotiation stalls or Alice becomes unreasonable, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** By raising your offer slightly from $80 to $95, you show a willingness to negotiate without conceding too much. 
* **Framing as a compromise:**  Positioning $95 as a ""fair compromise"" makes it sound more appealing to Alice and highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  While you've moved closer to Alice's desired price, you're still below her last offer and below John's price, keeping the pressure on for her to accept."
