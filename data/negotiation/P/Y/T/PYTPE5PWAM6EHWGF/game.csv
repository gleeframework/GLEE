"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. As we begin, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1050000. I'd like to make a new offer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1010000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'd like to propose a new counteroffer of $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that you're getting a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'll meet you at $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1025000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence as well, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1025000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including selling the product to John for the full $1200000.",1025000.0,Alice,7,,
