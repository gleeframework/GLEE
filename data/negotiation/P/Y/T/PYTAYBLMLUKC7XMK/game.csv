"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000, Bob. I'm confident that its value to you is higher than that. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
