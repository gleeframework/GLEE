Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit above my minimum of $100.  I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm open to a counteroffer, but I'm also ready to sell to John if Bob doesn't come up to a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I won't sell for less than $100.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is still a profit for me and closer to my initial offer.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me.  I'm not willing to go below $100.  I'll sell to John and avoid any further negotiations."
