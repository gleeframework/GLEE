Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""great deal for its value,"" I aim to frame the product as worth more than Bob might think, potentially influencing his perception. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message is polite and encourages further interaction, whether it's Bob accepting, countering, or further discussing the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the negotiation open. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($150) and my initial offer. Accepting would be a significant loss.  I'll counter-offer to steer the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $80 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but counter with a price that signals a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common tactic can feel like a fair compromise to Bob, even though it's still significantly closer to my initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $140 leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while staying close to my desired profit margin. 

I'm hoping this counter-offer encourages Bob to engage more seriously while keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting closer Alice, but $140 is still a bit much for my budget. Could you do $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his maximum perceived value ($100).  While this is closer to my previous counter-offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to result in a price I find acceptable.

Therefore, the most profitable decision is to sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I get a fair deal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
