"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you based on your needs and goals. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both the product's worth and your interest. Considering the product's actual value is $15,000 to you, I would like to suggest an offer of $14,000. This allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring you receive a high-quality product at a reasonable price. Let's schedule a call to further discuss this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor you to a higher perceived value ($15,000) that is not your actual valuation. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John, so there's no need to immediately accept an offer that's only $1,000 less. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for further negotiation and potentially a better price."
