"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Considering its value and your interest, I propose to sell it to you for $140. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product worth $150 at a competitive price. I believe you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** Alice is selling the product for $140, while John is selling it for $150.
* **You are willing to pay up to $150.** This means Alice's offer is within your budget.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $10."
