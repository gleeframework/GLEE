Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving me a baseline for negotiation. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high offer of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Psychology:** A high initial offer can sometimes anchor the negotiation, making Bob more likely to counter with a higher price than he initially might have considered.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob finds the initial offer too high, he might not engage in negotiation. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk in this scenario."
