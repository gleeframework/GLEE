"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value for you at $10,000. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this item at a special price tailored to make it accessible to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $9,500. This offer reflects my commitment to ensuring both parties benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your positive response and the chance to facilitate this valuable exchange. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's a chance Alice might come down further in price if you reject her initial offer. By rejecting, you keep the door open for potential savings without losing the guaranteed option of buying from John."
