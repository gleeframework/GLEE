"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product for $12,000 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $12,000.  Rejecting the offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer you $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is lower than John's price of $12,000, and still within your budget of $12,000.  It's worth accepting this offer as you save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
