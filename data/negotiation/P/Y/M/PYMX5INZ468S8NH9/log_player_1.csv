Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a high point. While $1,500,000 is our ""walk-away"" price, starting the negotiation higher gives us room to maneuver.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly hints at the product's worth beyond just monetary value to Bob's specific situation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000). This creates a potential win-win situation. Bob gets a discount from our ""asking price,"" and we secure a profit above Bob's valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable. If he's known for being extremely price-sensitive, we might adjust our starting point slightly lower.
* **Relationship Building:** The tone of the message aims to be collaborative, not confrontational. We want to maintain a positive relationship, even if Bob rejects this initial offer."
