Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, you can potentially earn more than the $120 from John, but you also have the option to go back to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still worth trying to get a bit more.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it would help me cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
