"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. How about offering you the product for $125? This allows you to acquire it at a slight premium while still saving you some money compared to my full asking price. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
