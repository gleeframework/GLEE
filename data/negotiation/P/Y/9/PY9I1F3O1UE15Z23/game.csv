"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this proposal?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I understand your perspective on the value. However, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial proposal, and I believe it undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts on this proposal?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still a fair distance apart. To be transparent, I have another potential buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to acquire this product.  My final offer is $1,050,000.  This is my absolute best price, and I need a decision by the next round.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a decision by the next round, but I need you to consider my revised offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
