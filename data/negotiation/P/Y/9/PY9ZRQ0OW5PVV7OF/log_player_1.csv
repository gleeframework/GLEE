Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,325,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good way to wrap up this negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are getting close to my minimum, but Bob is adamant about $1,300,000. I've already rejected his offer twice at this price.  With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time. To avoid risking a complete breakdown in negotiations, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than losing the deal entirely."
