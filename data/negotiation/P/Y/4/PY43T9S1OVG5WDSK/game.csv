"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing both of us to walk away satisfied.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $9,000, which is still below the original offer, but closer to what I'm looking for?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's try to meet at $9,250. I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gets me closer to what I need.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concern about your minimum price, but $9,250 is still too far from where I can comfortably be right now. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a fair price that gets us closer to an agreement and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen!",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit anxious about meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. Let's try to meet at $9,500. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,9,
