Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is quite high for me. I'm interested in this product but  $20000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. This is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $16000. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  My budget is firm at $8000. This is a fair price, considering the product is worth no more than that to me. If you're not able to meet my offer, I'll have to go with John's offer instead.",8000.0,Bob,4,
