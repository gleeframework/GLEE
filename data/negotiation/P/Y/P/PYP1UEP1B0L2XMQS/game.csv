"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This aligns with my budget and is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a good compromise, considering its value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1050000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
