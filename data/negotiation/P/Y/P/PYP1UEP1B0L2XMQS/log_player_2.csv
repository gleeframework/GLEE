"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. You can reject her offer and see if you can get her down to a price you're comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This aligns with my budget and is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a good compromise, considering its value to you and my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to try and see if you can get her closer to your ideal price. You can likely secure a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers the product's value and my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having this conversation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1080000. This is a good compromise, considering its value to you and my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks the possibility of her rejecting your next counteroffer and increasing her price again, pushing you even further away from your goal."
