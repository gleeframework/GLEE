Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident it will be a strong investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $720,000.  I believe that's a fair price that considers both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $720,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $720,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However, $850,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $750,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to give up yet - I'm going to see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $750,000. Let's try to find some common ground. How about $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
