"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident it will be a strong investment for you. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $720,000.  I believe that's a fair price that considers both our interests.",720000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $720,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However, $850,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $750,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $750,000. Let's try to find some common ground. How about $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
