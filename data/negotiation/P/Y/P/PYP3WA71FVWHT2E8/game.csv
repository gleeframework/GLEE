"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. My initial offer is $20,000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $18,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $15,000. Can you consider that?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $17,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",16500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns about time, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,500. I'd be willing to go up to $16,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll make the deal.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to close the deal. I can do $16,250, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'm going to have to explore other options.",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your frustration, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,250. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Sorry, Alice.",8000.0,Bob,10,
