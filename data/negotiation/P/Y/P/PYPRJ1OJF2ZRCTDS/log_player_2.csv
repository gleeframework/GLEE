"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to offers, but I value it at $11500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and has a limit of $12,000.  Alice's initial offer of $11,500 is too high. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible while still being within his budget.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11000?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit high for Bob.  He can likely get it for a lower price by continuing to negotiate, potentially saving a few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for being flexible. While I appreciate the lower price, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I'm really hoping to get this product, but I'm working with a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's increased his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise, but still staying below his ideal price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while minimizing his risk."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $10750 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10875. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,875 is within Bob's budget and is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. There are limited rounds left, and Alice might not budge further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
