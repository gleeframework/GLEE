"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11000?  It's still a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for being flexible. While I appreciate the lower price, $11000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference at $10750?  I'm really hoping to get this product, but I'm working with a tight budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $10750 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10875. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",10875.0,Alice,5,
