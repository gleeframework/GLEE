"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product,  since you mentioned it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I can try to get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15000, but it's still a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's more than what John would pay, and it avoids further negotiation with Bob."
