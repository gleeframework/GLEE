"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $12000 to me.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product,  since you mentioned it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15000, but it's still a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would give us both a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Bob,4,
