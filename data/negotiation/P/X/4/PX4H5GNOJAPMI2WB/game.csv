"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $8,000 to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $10,250 is pushing it. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and settle on $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm still at $9,750, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options",9750.0,Bob,8,
