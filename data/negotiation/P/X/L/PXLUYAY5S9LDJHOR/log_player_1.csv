I'm still aiming high, but I've lowered the price to show flexibility.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to both of us."

I'm going to try one more time with a slightly lower price. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a reasonable offer, given his previous counteroffers. If he rejects this, I'll go with John."

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,400,000, and it seems like we're at an impasse. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
