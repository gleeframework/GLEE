"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I know it's something you've been looking for. I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $15,000 from John, so paying $16,500 is not worth it.
