Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could benefit both of you.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high to give yourself room to negotiate, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its long-term benefits. I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 gives you bargaining room.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out a number; you're hinting at ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** You signal that you're willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  You could start with a different offer within the ZOPA depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to push Bob."
