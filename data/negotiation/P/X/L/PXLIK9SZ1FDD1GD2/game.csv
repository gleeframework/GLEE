"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $87.50. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $87.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $86.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $86. How about $86.75? It's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",86.75,Alice,5,
