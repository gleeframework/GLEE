Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's try to find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still firm on $13,250. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, getting closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a higher price than his last offer. I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
