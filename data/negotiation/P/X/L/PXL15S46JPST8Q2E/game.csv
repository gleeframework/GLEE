"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's try to find a compromise here.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still firm on $13,250. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal. This is my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,5,
