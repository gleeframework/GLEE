"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from John, so it's best to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $13,500.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John.  It's a good compromise, so accept it."
