"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems great, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $13,500.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
