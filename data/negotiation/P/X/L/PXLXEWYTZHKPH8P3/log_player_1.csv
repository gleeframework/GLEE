{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a great product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me.  It's also important to be friendly and open to negotiation, as it can help build a positive relationship with Bob, potentially leading to more profitable deals in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $14,000.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $13,500.  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
