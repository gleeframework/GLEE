Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,080,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While you could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk she'll stick to her final offer, and you'll end up buying from John for a much higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
