"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me room to negotiate and leaves the door open for a potential deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This price is a good compromise, and I believe it's likely Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely go with John's offer. I'm running out of rounds to get a good price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. However,  I'm still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. With limited rounds left, I need to be more aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I have a few rounds left to get a better offer, so I'll counteroffer one last time before I go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to drop my price further to $975,000, which is closer to Bob's valuation but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will realize this is a good deal for him and finally accept. If he doesn't, I will unfortunately have to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I need to be realistic about the situation.  I've made multiple concessions to Bob, but he seems unwilling to meet me halfway.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing with John."
