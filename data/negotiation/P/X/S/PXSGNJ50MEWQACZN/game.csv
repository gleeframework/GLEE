"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",8200.0,Alice,5,
