Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I need to make a profit ($150) but still lower than what the product is worth to me. This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still leaves me with a good margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept to make a profit. It's better to sell to him now than risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with nothing."
