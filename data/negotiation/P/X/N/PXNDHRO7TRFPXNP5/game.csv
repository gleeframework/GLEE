"Alice,  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $850,000.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your keen interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $885,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again, and agree on $880,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,6,
