Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is lower than our minimum, starting with a price above our minimum gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** This price establishes a high anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""good deal.""
* **John as a Safety Net:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so we can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
