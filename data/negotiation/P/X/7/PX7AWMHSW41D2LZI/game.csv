"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,150,000? This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its value.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This would be a great deal for you, as you'd still be getting your desired price, and I would be happy to finally own this product. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
