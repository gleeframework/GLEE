"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save even more. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,000,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential reward.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price within Bob's budget."
