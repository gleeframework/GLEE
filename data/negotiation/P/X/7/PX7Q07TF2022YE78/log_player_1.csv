Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. This allows for a good chance of a deal while still securing a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,000,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I will counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
