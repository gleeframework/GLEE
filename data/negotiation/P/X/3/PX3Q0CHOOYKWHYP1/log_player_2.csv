"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price but still a significant gain for you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her minimum, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
