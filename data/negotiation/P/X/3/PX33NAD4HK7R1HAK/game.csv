"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7875? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",7875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7875 is still below my minimum.  To show I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $8000. That's a fair price, and I believe it's a win for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
