"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it offers.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet your current price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this might be closer to what you're looking for.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1050000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1075000. This is a very fair offer, given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground, and make this deal work.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
