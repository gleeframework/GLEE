Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think it's a great deal and would be perfect for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, knowing I have a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum ($150) creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit even further.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose anything as John guarantees the $150."
