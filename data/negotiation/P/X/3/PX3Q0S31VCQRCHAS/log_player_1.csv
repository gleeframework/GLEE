Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:**  While $14,500 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it's possible he might be willing to pay a premium if the product is important to him or he highly values your reputation/the source of the product. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price while still keeping the sale to Bob on the table."
