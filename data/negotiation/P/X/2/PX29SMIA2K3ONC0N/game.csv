"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $920,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement. Let's see if we can come to a final agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with going below $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $915,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
