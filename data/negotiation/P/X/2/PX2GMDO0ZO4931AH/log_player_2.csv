"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's valued at $15000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13000. This is a substantial discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John for $10,000, saving him $3,000."
