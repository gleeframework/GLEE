Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **The Price:**  $135 is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my guaranteed value from John ($150). This increases the chance of Bob accepting. 
* **The Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, while also stating my price clearly. 

By offering a lower price to Bob, I increase the likelihood of selling to him and earning some profit. However, if he declines, I can still guarantee a profit by selling to John."
