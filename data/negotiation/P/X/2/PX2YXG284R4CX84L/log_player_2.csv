"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his desired $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer will allow Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price he's more comfortable with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,500. While Alice's offer of $11,250 is lower than her previous offer, it's still a bit higher than Bob's desired price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  It's worth noting that he has 5 rounds remaining before needing to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,250. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,625 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. He has 3 rounds left before needing to consider buying from John, so he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting this offer will allow Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price he's more comfortable with."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last round to negotiate with Alice.  The price is still above his target, and the cost of buying from John is only $3,000 more.  Given the limited time remaining, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
