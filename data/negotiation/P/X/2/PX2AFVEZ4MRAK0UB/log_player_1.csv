"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John, so I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping that we can reach a price closer to my desired target.  If we don't, I can still sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still just a little too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
