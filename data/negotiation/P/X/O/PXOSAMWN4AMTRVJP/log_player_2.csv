"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing you have an alternative buyer. While $9,500 isn't a terrible deal, you can likely get it for less by negotiating or going with John."
