{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is too high. It's worth pursuing a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $250,000. This signals my seriousness about acquiring the product but also sets a clear starting point for negotiation. It's a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $800,000 to me and $1,200,000 to Alice."

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  It's important to remember that buying from John is always an option if we can't agree on a price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:** I'm going to raise my counteroffer to $925,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still pushing for a lower price. We're getting close to a deal, and I believe this counteroffer will be persuasive."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still too high. We only have a few rounds left, and it's unlikely we'll be able to agree on a price that's acceptable to both of us.  I'm going to purchase the product from John. It's a better deal for me and it ensures I get the product."
