Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob for his maximum valuation ($800,000), we know John will pay $1,500,000. Our goal is to maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
 
By setting the price at $1,400,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
