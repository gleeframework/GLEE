"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum.  How about $1,600,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
