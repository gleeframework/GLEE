"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to lower the price to $125. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
