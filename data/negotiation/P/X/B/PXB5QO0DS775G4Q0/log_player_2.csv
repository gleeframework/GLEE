"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $120.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer that's still within Alice's perceived value of $120 but significantly lowers the price. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good compromise. Bob has already tried $130, and going lower again might risk Alice walking away.  $135 is a decent deal for Bob, as it's within his budget and leaves him room to make a profit if he chooses to resell the product.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product without further negotiation and avoids potentially losing the deal to John."
