"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to offer you $7,500. This is a fair price considering your value of $8,000, and it gives us both a good deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $8,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's closer to my original price, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $7,800? This is a fair price that is closer to my initial offer, and still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,800 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to consider a price of $8,100, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests.",8100.0,Alice,5,
