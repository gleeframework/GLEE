"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $1400000.

I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision at $1600000. However, I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
