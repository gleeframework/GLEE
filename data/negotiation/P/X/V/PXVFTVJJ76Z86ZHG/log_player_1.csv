"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than the product's value to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that is significantly below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  This is my fallback plan if I can't reach a reasonable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $10,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the deal for Bob by pointing out the price is still a good value for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $7,250 is still far below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.
* **John is my safety net:**  I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob, so I can comfortably reject his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($8,500) and Bob's offer ($7,250).
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum price of $12,000, but showing a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm stating my offer clearly and concisely, without unnecessary fluff."
