"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This reflects its potential value while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value while showing some flexibility. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  To make this work, I'm willing to go to $1050000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's unique features and potential, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $1080000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value while showing some flexibility. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. We're getting closer, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1080000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1060000. This represents a significant compromise on my part and gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price. I'm hopeful that we can find common ground here.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
