"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $16,000? That's a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that. However, $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's close to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, and that's my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
