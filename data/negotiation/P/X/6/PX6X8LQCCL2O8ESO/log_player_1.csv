Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its worth."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, knowing my minimum is $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so the offer to Bob needs to be enticing."
