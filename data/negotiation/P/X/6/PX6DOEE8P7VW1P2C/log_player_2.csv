"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for cheaper. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to sell to me. However, $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit higher than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than Bob's maximum price:** $87.50 is still within Bob's budget of $120.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and he risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate may not be worth the potential savings. 

Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a reasonable price, saving him $32.50 compared to buying from John."
