"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $16,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $16,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
