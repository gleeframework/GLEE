Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, it's clear he is very unlikely to meet the $1,200,000 threshold.  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks leaving me with a lower offer or no deal at all with time running out. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed deal at this point."
