"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $127. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,5,
