Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Even though Bob's offer is now above John's, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure an even better deal.  It's worth risking another round to see if we can get closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $860,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and this offer is a reasonable profit above John's guaranteed price. It's time to accept and close the deal."
