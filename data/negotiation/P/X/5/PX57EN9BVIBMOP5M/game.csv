"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  That would give you a good deal, and allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
