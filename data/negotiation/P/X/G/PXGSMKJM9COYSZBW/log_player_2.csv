It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance you can get a better price than $900,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $800,000 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves some room for further bargaining."
