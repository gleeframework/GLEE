Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($8,000) means potentially earning more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 creates a significant perceived discount while still leaving room for profit above our minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as a limited-time opportunity before a public listing, we might incentivize Bob to act quickly."
