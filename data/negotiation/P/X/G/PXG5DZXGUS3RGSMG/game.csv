"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, the $1,200,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
