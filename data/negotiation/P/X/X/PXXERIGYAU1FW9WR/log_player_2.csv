"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a budget, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, and Bob's budget is $900,000. This means Alice is only $50,000 away from Bob's ideal price. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price reductions, potentially pushing Alice to the point where she'd rather sell to John. Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $250,000 compared to buying from John."
