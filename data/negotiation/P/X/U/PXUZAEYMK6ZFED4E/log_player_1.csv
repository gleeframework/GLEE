Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob ($17,000). This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes my potential profit. 
* **Positive and friendly:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build a rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's good condition to emphasize its worth. 

This strategy allows for potential negotiation but also protects my minimum desired value. If Bob rejects, I can counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $13,000 is below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm not willing to accept his offer, I believe there's still room for a compromise. 
* **Exploring further:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy allows me to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially reaching a higher price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While $13,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can feel comfortable with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($17,000) and Bob's offer ($13,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Maintaining my position:** While I'm compromising, I'm still maintaining my position of not going below my minimum desired value. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $12500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $12,500 is significantly below my minimum desired value of $15,000.  
* **No further room for negotiation:**  At this point, it's unlikely that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired value. 

This strategy ensures that I don't lose out on my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my price."
