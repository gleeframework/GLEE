"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $900,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I need to get, but within a reasonable range that I think Bob might be willing to consider.  I've also included a friendly message to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low a price yet. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a good price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I need to get for the product. It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
