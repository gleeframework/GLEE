# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $900,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a good price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise!
