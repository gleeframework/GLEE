Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price given the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to motivate him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not going for the full $1,500,000 right away, I'm creating an opportunity for Bob to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $1250000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant savings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price than $1,250,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm willing to continue negotiating and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000? This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. "", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a ""reasonable deal"" to remind Bob of the product's value.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:** This counteroffer keeps my profit higher than what I would receive from selling to John.

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I increase the chances of reaching an agreement while still ensuring a profitable outcome for myself."
