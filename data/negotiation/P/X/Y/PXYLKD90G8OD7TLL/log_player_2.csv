"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is your maximum budget, there's no benefit to negotiating with her.  Buying from John for the same price guarantees the purchase without the risk of a prolonged negotiation or Alice potentially rejecting your counteroffer."
