Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a million, we're still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from Bob's side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementing his offers in smaller amounts, indicating he's getting closer to his limit.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to signal I'm getting closer to my walk-away point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $990,000 is really pushing my bottom line.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be for you too. I'm willing to accept $1,010,000, but I need to be firm on this. This is my final offer."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go above $980,000.  It's unlikely he'll budge significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer represents a $220,000 loss compared to selling to John. At this point, cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is the most logical business decision."
