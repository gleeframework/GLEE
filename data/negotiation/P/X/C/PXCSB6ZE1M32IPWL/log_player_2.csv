"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal at $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much money as possible, so we start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:**  Maintaining a polite and open tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than I expected, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9,000 for the product. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above our target price and John's offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** We want to see how much further Alice is willing to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,500.  Would that be possible?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're aiming for a price closer to our target while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. Splitting the difference between her last offer ($9,000) and our previous offer ($5,000) would be $7,000. We're going slightly below that to leave room for a final counter from Alice.
* **Clear Target:** We're explicitly stating our desired price range, which gives Alice a clear number to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I can do $8,200 for the product. This is still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice's offer of $8,200 is only slightly above our ideal price and John's offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  We've already used 5 rounds of negotiation. Continuing might not yield a significantly better outcome, and we risk Alice hardening her position. 
* **Saving Some Money:** While not the $8,000 we hoped for, buying from Alice at $8,200 still represents a $6,800 saving compared to her initial offer."
