"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its worth in the current market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000. There's room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and I'm confident it's a fair price considering our both needs."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the product's value. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's target of $800,000.  Bob has two options:

1. **Reject and Counteroffer:** Bob can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down to his desired price. 
2. **Buy From John:**  Bob can choose to buy from John, which would guarantee him the product at his target price. 

Given the limited rounds and the possibility of Alice not accepting further counteroffers, Bob should **reject the offer** and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. However, if the negotiations stall or fail, Bob should be prepared to switch to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm committed to reaching an agreement. However,  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can finalize it."", ""product_price"": 975000}
