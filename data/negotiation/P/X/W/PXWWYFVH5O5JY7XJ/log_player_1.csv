Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 minimum. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving you with a lower final price when you have a guaranteed better option."
