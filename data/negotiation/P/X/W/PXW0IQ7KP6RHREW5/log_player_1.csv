Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message highlights the value proposition for Bob, even at the higher price. 

**Outcome Possibilities:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $14,500, exceeding your guaranteed sale price.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell the product to John for $15,000, meeting your minimum acceptable profit."
