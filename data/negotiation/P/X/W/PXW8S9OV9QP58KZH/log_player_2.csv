You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate with Alice to get a lower price, closer to her value of $1,000,000."
