Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price.

I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,200,000, and at this point, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her digging in and refusing to budge further.  You can get the product for your maximum price right now from John."
