"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me some of the way.  To be honest, anything above $1,100,000 is going to be very difficult for me.  I'm hoping we can find some common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,250,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
