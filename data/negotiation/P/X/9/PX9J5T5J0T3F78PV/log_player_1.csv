"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value of the product to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($120), giving me some flexibility during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Rejecting this offer doesn't mean ending the negotiation. It allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? That's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not going too far below my minimum.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Motivating Bob:**  I'm hinting at the possibility of finding another buyer if he doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No further room for negotiation:**  At this point, further negotiation would only risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially losing time before I can sell to John.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to be decisive to secure the best deal."
