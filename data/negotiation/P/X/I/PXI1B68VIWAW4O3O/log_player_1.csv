Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you at $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I anticipate significant interest from other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting a price of $20,000, you're anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value. While $8,000 is his valuation, your high starting point might make him more amenable to a price higher than that.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, there's a chance Bob might accept a price higher than $15,000, maximizing your profit."
