"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm eager to make a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
