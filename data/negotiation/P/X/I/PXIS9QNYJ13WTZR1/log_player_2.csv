"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $100 to me.  Alice's offer of $50 is a good start, but I can likely get a better price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm going to reject and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 40% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and leaves room for negotiation. I'm still within my budget, and it's a strong starting point for the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $40 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target price. With 7 rounds left, I believe I can continue negotiating and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $30 to $35. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my ideal target.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize the value of closing the deal and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $45 is closer to my target price, it's still not ideal.  I have 5 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might budge further, especially as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $40. Alice has already moved closer to my desired price.  I believe by holding firm and demonstrating willingness to walk away, I can increase the pressure on Alice to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $47.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $47.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decision. While $47.5 is higher than my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer and still leaves me with some savings.  Given the limited time and the possibility of a stalemate, accepting the offer seems like the best option at this point.  It's a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
