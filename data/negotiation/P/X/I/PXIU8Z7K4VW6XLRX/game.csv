"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a steal for something worth far more.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time. Let me know if this is a starting point we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700000 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? This would allow me to make the purchase and would still provide you with a reasonable profit.",800000.0,Bob,4,
