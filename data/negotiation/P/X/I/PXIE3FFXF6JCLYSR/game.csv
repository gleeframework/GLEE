"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can stretch. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",915000.0,Bob,6,
