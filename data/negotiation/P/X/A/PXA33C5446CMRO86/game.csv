"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $120 is closer but still a bit out of my price range.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere around $95?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I can give you a deal for $110, which is still a good price for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with it!",110.0,Alice,5,
