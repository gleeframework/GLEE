"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $775,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $775,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
