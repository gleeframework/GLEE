"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $145. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to pay a bit less. How about $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $140 is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a steal at that price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it would be ideal to get the price down further, $140 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John."
