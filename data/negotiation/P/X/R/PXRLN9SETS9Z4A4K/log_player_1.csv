Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice, and I'm really interested in the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $15,000 to Alice, and Bob is offering $9,000. It's better to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $9,200 is still a long way from what this product is actually worth.  Let's split the difference and I'll take $10,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice, and I'm still interested in the product. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to make one final counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I can't go any lower than $9,800. This is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  If you're truly serious about buying it, I'm willing to take this final offer. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other options."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations. I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a satisfactory result.  John is offering a much better price, and it's time to move on."
