I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100), hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm also trying to build rapport by being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price but still remaining above my minimum value. I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate and being friendly to encourage Bob to accept the offer."

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum value, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
