"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?  I'm serious about buying the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
