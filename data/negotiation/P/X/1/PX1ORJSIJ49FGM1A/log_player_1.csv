I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly higher than my minimum value. 

This is a risky strategy, but it's necessary to maximize potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $1,500,000 goal, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, forcing me to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000.

Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000, securing a satisfactory profit and avoiding further potential losses."
