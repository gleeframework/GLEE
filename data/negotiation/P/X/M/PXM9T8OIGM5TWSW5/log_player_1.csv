Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can secure a higher price with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit too high at $1,100,000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a middle ground."

We've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm concerned we're not going to be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  To guarantee I make my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
