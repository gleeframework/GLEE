,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. Can you meet me at $78? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That's my bottom line, and it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
