"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $800000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for on the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let me know if you're open to this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'll counteroffer at $950000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",950000.0,Alice,5,
