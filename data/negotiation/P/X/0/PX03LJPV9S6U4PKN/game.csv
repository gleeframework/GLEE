"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $132?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal.",132.0,Bob,4,
