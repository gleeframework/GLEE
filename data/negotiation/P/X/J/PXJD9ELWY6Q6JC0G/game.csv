"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this type of product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I value your research, $1200000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which still reflects the unique value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1400000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
