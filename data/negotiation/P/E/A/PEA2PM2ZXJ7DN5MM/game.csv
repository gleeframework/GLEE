"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $850,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I can secure it elsewhere for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I'm getting from the sale. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
