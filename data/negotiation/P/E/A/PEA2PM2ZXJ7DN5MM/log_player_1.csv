Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $850,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I can secure it elsewhere for $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I'm getting from the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}"
