"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick off negotiations, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget, and he can get the product from John for significantly less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, but if she's not willing to come down, Bob can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for less, and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some frustration on both sides, and I want to find a resolution that works for us both.  While I'm confident in the $1,350,000 valuation, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant concession on my part and I believe it's more than fair.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a big step down from her previous offers, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He knows he can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to rush into a deal with Alice unless she gets closer to his price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, but if Alice doesn't budge, Bob can always switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
