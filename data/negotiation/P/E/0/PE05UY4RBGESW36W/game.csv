"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's still a good price for you, and it leaves me a bit of room to make a profit.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $15,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
