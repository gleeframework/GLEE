"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and potentially negotiate downwards while still aiming for a profitable sale.  I'm leaving myself some room to maneuver, but also putting pressure on Bob to consider my value proposition."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward while also pressuring Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter with a higher offer, hoping to bridge the gap with Bob and secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,300,000. I'm steadily decreasing my asking price, but still aiming for a substantial profit.  With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between securing a good price and avoiding a stalemate. This offer shows a willingness to compromise while leaving some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is approaching my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with one final offer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If we fail to reach an agreement, I'll sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000, which is still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's a risky move, as I'm leaving very little room for negotiation, but I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in my product and accepts. If he rejects, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offer barely above my minimum, I'm going to sell to John. The risk of another round of negotiations, with a potential for a lower offer, isn't worth it. John's offer is a safe bet that guarantees a profit and meets my minimum requirement."
