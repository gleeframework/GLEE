**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $1,225,000 offer, especially since he has labeled it as his ""final offer.""  Continuing the negotiation risks leaving Alice with a worse outcome, potentially having to settle for even less later.  

Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome and ensures Alice doesn't lose money by accepting a lower offer from Bob.  While a deal with Bob is slightly higher, it's not worth the risk of him digging in his heels and refusing to budge."
