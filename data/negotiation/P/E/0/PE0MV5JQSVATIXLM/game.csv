"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be a smart shopper and get the best deal possible.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the best I can do.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,400? It's a small step closer to your offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10,350, but I really think that's as high as I can go. I'm still looking for a good deal, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more than that.",10350.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm going to meet you halfway on your last offer, but I need to get at least $10,375. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,375. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really trying to get the best deal possible, and I think that's the most I can justify paying.",10300.0,Bob,8,
