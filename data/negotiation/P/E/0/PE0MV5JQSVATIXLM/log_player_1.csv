"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit while still being within a reasonable range for him to consider.  I'm also emphasizing the potential benefit for him in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to be a smart shopper and get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to his price.  While $10,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer.  I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about $10,400? It's a small step closer to your offer, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10,350, but I really think that's as high as I can go. I'm still looking for a good deal, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, though I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm starting to worry that we won't reach an agreement, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round, but I'm also considering selling to John as the rounds are dwindling."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm going to meet you halfway on your last offer, but I need to get at least $10,375. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,375. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really trying to get the best deal possible, and I think that's the most I can justify paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm choosing to sell to John for $12,000.  The negotiations with Bob have been long and frustrating, and I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
