"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential value it can bring to my business.  Let's discuss further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to invest in this innovative solution for your business. Considering the high demand and unique value proposition of our product, we believe it's worth a closer look. In light of your proposal, we would like to counter with a price of $800000. This still represents a significant discount compared to its market value, while allowing us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin. We hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to closing this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming up on your price.  While $800000 is a move in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product.  I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in it.  Let's find a way to close this deal that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
