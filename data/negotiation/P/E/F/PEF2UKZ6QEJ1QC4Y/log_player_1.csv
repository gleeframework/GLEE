Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly hinting that the price is justified without directly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrases ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal to Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating. 

While you have a guaranteed sale with John, there's a chance Bob might accept a price higher than $10,000, increasing your potential profit."
