"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you considering me. However, $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still not there. I can do $12,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $13,500. That's the best I can do for now.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1,000. That brings the total value to $14,500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13500.0,Alice,7,
