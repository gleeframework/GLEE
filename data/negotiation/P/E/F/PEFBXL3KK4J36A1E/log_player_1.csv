Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, but also shows I value the product highly."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,350,000. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
