"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $95 is too high.
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible.
* You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so you're offering a price that's still above her value but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* This counteroffer leaves room for potential negotiation and compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $90 is still a bit high, but it's closer to your desired price point.
* You can save $10 by accepting this offer compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky as you could end up paying more."
