"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be valuable to you. I am offering it for $1000000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. There is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product,  $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product for $850000. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He can try to negotiate further to lower the price closer to $800,000. There are still rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'd like to offer $825,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to gain from the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm pleased to respond with a counteroffer of $840000. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and I believe it will be acceptable to you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above his ideal price point. With only 5 rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate to try and get a better deal closer to his $800,000 budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While $840,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target.  I'd like to offer $810,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  "", ""product_price"": 810000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. In light of your latest offer, I am willing to consider $825000 as the final price for the product. I believe this price respects both our positions and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still $25,000 above his desired price point. With 3 rounds remaining, Bob can still try to push for a lower price, potentially reaching his goal of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to offer $815,000.  This is a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement with this offer."", ""product_price"": 815000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. Based on your last offer, I am prepared to agree on a final price of $820000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise and I hope it will be satisfactory to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, Bob has only one round left. He's already very close to his desired price of $800,000 with John. It's risky to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's no guarantee she'll accept his final counteroffer.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum price point."
