"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $8,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is a win-win for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
