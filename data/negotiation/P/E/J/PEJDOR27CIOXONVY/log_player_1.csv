"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm being optimistic and hoping to get a good price quickly. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try and get a little more.  I believe the product is worth more than $85 to him, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $95? It's still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $90 is the highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good price considering the product's value to me and his willingness to negotiate. It's more than what I would get from John, so I'll accept it and close the deal."
