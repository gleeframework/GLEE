"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $175 for it.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,4,
