"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high bar for the negotiation and gives me room to potentially negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right now.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $1,600,000 is a good price and I'm confident I can make a profit. It's also better than the $1,500,000 I would get from John.  It's time to close this deal."
