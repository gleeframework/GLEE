"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my target price.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $980,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $980,000 is still too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is my absolute bottom line, so I hope you can consider it seriously. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but I need to be sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you consider meeting me at this price, or is there any flexibility left in your pricing?",990000.0,Bob,6,
