"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted for.  To be able to make a deal, I'd need to see the price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, though, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't accurately reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further to $950,000. I believe this offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
