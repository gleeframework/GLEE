"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800000. Let's negotiate!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900000? This still gives you a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 still isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to at least get $850000.  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it would allow me to get closer to the value I need.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000. That's the highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
