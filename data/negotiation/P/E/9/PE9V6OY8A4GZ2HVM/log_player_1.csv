Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000? This still gives you a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $700,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'll try to negotiate a slightly better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 still isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to at least get $850,000.  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it would allow me to get closer to the value I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the highest he's offered so far, and while it's less than I initially wanted, it's the closest I've gotten to my target value.  I'm going to accept his offer."
