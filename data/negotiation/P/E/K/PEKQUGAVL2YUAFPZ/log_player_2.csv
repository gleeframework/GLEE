# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice's offer is good, but there's still room to save money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm hoping to get the price down a bit further. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice is coming down, but we can still push a little further.  Let's try one more counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  Let's meet in the middle again and I'll go up to $1,125,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,130,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000

```

Alice has come down significantly, and we're very close to our target price.  It's worth accepting this offer and saving $370,000.  There's always a risk that we could get a better deal in the future, but it's unlikely, and we're already saving a substantial amount."
