"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm hoping to get the price down a bit further. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would still give you a good return and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work!",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  Let's meet in the middle again and I'll go up to $1,125,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,130,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
