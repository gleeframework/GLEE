"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could you do $10,500? I think that's a fair price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,
