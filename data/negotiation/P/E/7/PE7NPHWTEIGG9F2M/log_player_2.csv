"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'll sell it to you for $700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than my target price.  I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of potential savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $650,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied. I can likely push for a lower price with another counteroffer. Buying from John now would mean missing out on a potentially better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $640,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $640,000, which is very close to my target price of $600,000.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from Alice, and continuing to negotiate might risk her walking away altogether.  At this price, I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, so it's a good deal for me."
