"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $13500 is closer, but it's still below what I need to get for it.  How about we split the difference and go with $14250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about the price. I think $14250 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500, as I mentioned before, but I could stretch to $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
