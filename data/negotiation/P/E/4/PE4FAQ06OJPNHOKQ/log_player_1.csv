Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think it's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially still make a good profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product without revealing too much, aiming to pique Bob's interest.

This is just the starting point. Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $9500 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reason:** I'm not simply rejecting his offer but providing a reason (wanting to be closer to the asking price). 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise, meeting in the middle between my initial offer and his counteroffer.
* **Positive Language:** I'm staying positive and encouraging, reminding him of the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. Would you be willing to consider $9200? I think it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my desired price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from, but I'm really looking for $9,500 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $9,500 is my final offer. Let me know if you're ready to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my final price, showing I'm serious about getting a good deal, but also reminding Bob of the value he'll be getting.
* **""Meet You Halfway"" tactic:**  While I'm not actually compromising further, using this phrase can make the offer seem more like a concession and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Direct Call to Action:** I'm prompting Bob to make a decision, putting the ball back in his court.

If Bob still rejects, I'll have to decide whether selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're firm on $9500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9300? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,300 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than what I feel is a fair compromise.  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and Bob has shown that he's not willing to go higher. 

To avoid further delays and ensure I don't end up with a price significantly below my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a decent deal and guarantees me a sale."
