"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still leaving room for negotiation. It's a fair middle ground, hopefully enticing Bob to accept while allowing me to secure a more favorable price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can push for a better price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer in the next round and potentially achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway.  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting a higher offer from Bob are diminishing.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and secures a profit.  It's better to lock in this profit rather than risk further negotiation and potential losses."
