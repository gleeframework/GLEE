"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you great value.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value and the original price I had in mind, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
