"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but still ensures I make a decent profit.  I'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll see if I can get more from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is closer to my initial target and well above my minimum. It's worth accepting to avoid the risk of losing the deal to John or getting a lower offer in future rounds."
