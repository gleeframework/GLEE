"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $12,000, which is still above Bob's desired price.
* **Buying from John:**  This is a backup option, but Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal from Alice. 

**Strategy:** 
Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to make Alice move towards his desired price range. 
* **Message:**  Bob is polite but firm, explaining why he's rejecting the initial offer and providing a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Price:** Bob offers $10,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's price and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $11000. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  $11,000, which is still above Bob's ideal price but closer to his counteroffer.
* **Buying from John:**  Bob is still hoping to get a better deal from Alice, as he has time and rounds remaining.

**Strategy:** 
While Alice's offer is better than her initial price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting allows him to send another counteroffer, potentially securing a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Message:**  He emphasizes that this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.  
* **Price:** The offer of $10,500 is a good compromise, halfway between Alice's offer and Bob's previous counteroffer."
