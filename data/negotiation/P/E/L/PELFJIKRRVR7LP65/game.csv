"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I appreciate the compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
