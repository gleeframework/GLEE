"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $10,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
