Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. It's the lowest I can go without compromising the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to go below $10,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings.  It's more strategic to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000."
