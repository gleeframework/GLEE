"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have plenty of room to negotiate downward from her offer and closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000).  It's too early to buy from John at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) than Alice's initial asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauging Alice's Reaction:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be and provide insight into her bottom line. 
* **Alternative Option:** We still have the option to negotiate with John if Alice is not willing to budge on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $9,000 reflects that. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, it's still too high.  We need to show her we are willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Negotiating Room:**  There's still a significant gap between her offer ($9,000) and what we're willing to pay (closer to $7,000).  
* **John as Backup:** We're getting closer to John's price, but it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to that option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $7,750? I'm trying to find a middle ground here."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up in price, but in a controlled way, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counter-offer splits the difference between our last offer and her current one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to John's price and the round limit, so we need to make more substantial moves to try and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $8,500? That's a compromise I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice is definitely coming down, which is a good sign. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than we'd like.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and we need to apply a bit more pressure to get closer to our target price.
* **John Option:** While John's price is becoming more appealing, there's still a reasonable chance we can secure a better deal with a bit more negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the concessions you've made.  To be honest, $8,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is firm but polite. We're letting Alice know we're serious and this is our limit, but also acknowledging her willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Price:** $8,000 is a good psychological point. It's Alice's perceived value, so she might be more inclined to accept it.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, we need to increase the pressure to reach a deal or consider John's offer seriously."
