Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure is strategic.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum price leaves room for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price.  

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price while still ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
