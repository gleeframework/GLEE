"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is likely to find this price attractive as it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his last offer, but still above my minimum. This should show good faith and hopefully encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to a rejection, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.  It's better to secure a sale at $12,500 rather than risk losing a better deal."
