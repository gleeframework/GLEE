"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its potential value, I'm not yet ready to commit at that price.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its current market value and my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than your counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer for now.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product's value is closer to $900,000, given its current market conditions.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 as a final counteroffer, reflecting a fair value for both of us.

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,000,000. I'm offering you a price of $975,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
