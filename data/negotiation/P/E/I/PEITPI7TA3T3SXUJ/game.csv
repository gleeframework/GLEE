,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. But $9,800 is still too far away from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,100. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  But I'm really just $200 away from my desired price.  Let's close this deal at $10,000.  It's a great price for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know if you're ready to do this!",10000.0,Alice,7,
