"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth exploring lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below his maximum budget and closer to John's offer. This is a bold move to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to his target, there are still 7 rounds left to negotiate. There is a strong possibility that Alice will lower her price even further, so it makes sense for Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still below his maximum budget and demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This is a strategic move to test if Alice is becoming more flexible in her pricing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still above his maximum. With 5 rounds remaining, there is potential for further negotiation. Continuing to reject and counter-offer is the best strategy to try and reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a significant move, as it's the same price John is offering.  This demonstrates Bob's seriousness about acquiring the product while also putting pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, the negotiation is getting close. However, Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  It's risky to continue negotiating with Alice because:

* There's no guarantee she'll come down further in price. 
* There's a chance Alice might counter with an even higher price, making it worse than John's offer.

It's strategically better for Bob to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids potential risks."
