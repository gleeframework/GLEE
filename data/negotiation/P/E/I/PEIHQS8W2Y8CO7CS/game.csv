"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but I'd like to save some money. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal.  While your valuation is appreciated,  $1,200,000 undervalues some key aspects of this product and its potential impact for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,220,000? I'm trying to make a smart financial decision here, and I think this price would be a good compromise.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget considerations.  To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,250,000.  I believe this recognizes the value you gain while reflecting the product's worth in the market.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you be willing to consider $1,230,000? I think this is as low as I can go and still get a good deal.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
