"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility for a counter-offer from Alice closer to your acceptable range or allows you to purchase from John at a much better price."
