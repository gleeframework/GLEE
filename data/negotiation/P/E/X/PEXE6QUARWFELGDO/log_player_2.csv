"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering its actual value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Justification:** While a simple ""too high"" would suffice, providing a reason (even if it's slightly understating your true valuation) can make your offer appear more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $10,000 leaves a significant gap to Alice's starting price, but it's still within the realm of potential agreement, especially if Alice is motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $14,000 is still above your $12,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, so there's a good chance you can get the price down further. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the safety net of John's offer, so you're not desperate to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** You're moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  Your offer is still safely under your $12,000 limit.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  $11,000 represents a point closer to the middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's current one. 
* **Justification:**  You're re-emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Alice's desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** $13,000 is very close to your limit, but it's still above it. 
* **Final Push:** Alice has signaled this is her ""lowest,"" but it's possible one more counteroffer could sway her, even if it's just a small concession.
* **John as Leverage:** You can use John's offer as leverage to show Alice you have an alternative."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely honest, I can get a very similar product from another seller for $12,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need that price point to make sense for me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Honesty:**  You're being upfront about John's offer, which builds trust and shows you're serious.
* **Final Offer:** You're clearly indicating that $12,000 is your limit.
* **Appeal to Preference:**  By stating you'd ""prefer"" to work with Alice, you add a touch of persuasion. 

**Outcome:**

At this point, Alice is likely to either accept your offer (a win for you!) or hold firm at $13,000. If she stays at $13,000, you'll have to decide if it's worth paying the extra $1,000 to go with Alice or stick with your budget and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you've got a similar product from another seller for $12,000, but I'm willing to make one last offer to keep the deal with you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still above your $12,000 maximum. 
* **Firm Stance:** She has clearly stated that this is her last offer and she's willing to walk away. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a reliable backup option with John, offering the product at your target price.

**It's time to walk away from Alice's deal. You've negotiated well, but sometimes sticking to your budget is the smartest move.**"
