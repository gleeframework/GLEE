"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering its actual value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely honest, I can get a very similar product from another seller for $12,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I need that price point to make sense for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've got a similar product from another seller for $12,000, but I'm willing to make one last offer to keep the deal with you. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
