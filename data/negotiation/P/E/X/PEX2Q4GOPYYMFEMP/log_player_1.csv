Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below his maximum valuation ($1,400,000) gives him a perceived deal while still securing a substantial profit for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
