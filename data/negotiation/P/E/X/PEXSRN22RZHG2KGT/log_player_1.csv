Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Explanation: While I could push for more, accepting $1,000,000 makes the most strategic sense at this point:

* **Profitable:**  It's a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,200,000 value minus $1,000,000 offer = $200,000 profit).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away.  Getting closer to my absolute minimum might not be worth that risk.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available for other opportunities, rather than potentially drawn-out negotiations."
