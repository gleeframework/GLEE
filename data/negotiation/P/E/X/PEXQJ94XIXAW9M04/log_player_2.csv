Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that fits your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880000. This price still reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Alice has come down to $880,000, which is a good price for me.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting close to my goal of saving as much money as possible. Accepting the offer will secure the product and save me $320,000 compared to buying from John."
