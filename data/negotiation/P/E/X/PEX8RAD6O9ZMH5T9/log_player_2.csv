"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Offer:** $10,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, as it's well above her value of $8,000. 
* **Show Flexibility:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Building Rapport:**  The message emphasizes fairness to build trust and encourage Alice to accept the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm sure we can close the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, $11,000 is a very reasonable price. It's still well below Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Avoid Risk:** Continuing to negotiate has a risk. Alice might become less flexible, and Bob might end up paying more in the end. 
* **Time is Money:**  Each round of negotiation consumes time. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk a worse outcome later."
