"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for me to make concessions.
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm framing it as a fair reflection of the product's ""value and potential,"" not its actual market price (which we haven't established yet).
* **Leaving Room:** This initial offer gives Bob space to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. Would you consider a significantly lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his stated valuation. It suggests he's trying to anchor the negotiation very low. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about the product's value and encourage him to make a more reasonable proposal.  I'm confident I can still get a better price, even if it means going to John eventually."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below what I believe is a fair price for this product and its potential. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Reframing:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low. I'm subtly reframing the discussion from ""market value"" (which is debatable) to ""fair price."" 
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial price ($200,000) to show flexibility, but it's not a drastic move that would make me seem desperate. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer is still well above Bob's initial offer and provides a basis for further negotiation while moving closer to a potentially acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need us to find some middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but I can't go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my $1,000,000 reserve. It's clear that he's trying to see how low he can go. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if he doesn't offer a price closer to my valuation. I'll reject this offer and present a counteroffer that shows some flexibility but holds firm on the product's inherent worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is my final offer. This reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Scarcity:** By mentioning a ""hard minimum"" and presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and limited opportunity.
* **Justification:**  I'm still emphasizing the ""true value"" without getting bogged down in market comparisons, which could be subjective.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A $50,000 reduction from my previous offer shows movement but keeps the price firmly above Bob's offers.
* **Preparing for Alternatives:** This firm stance sets the stage for me to walk away and consider John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my price in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers to try to close this deal. Would you consider $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and shows a willingness to compromise. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a strong offer considering:

* **Profitable:**  $825,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding Bob's perceived value and significantly above my minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner, which has its own inherent value. Further negotiation could drag on, and there's no guarantee of a better offer from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** John's offer is my safety net, but there's always a slight risk he could back out. Accepting a strong offer from Bob eliminates that risk. 

While I could push for more, the risk of losing the deal altogether and settling for John's $1,000,000 makes accepting $825,000 the most prudent choice."
