,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something we can work with?",12000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay up to $14,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,4,
