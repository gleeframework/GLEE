"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the immense value it brings.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I need to see a price that works for me too.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $750,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still below my bottom line. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $950,000.  This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
