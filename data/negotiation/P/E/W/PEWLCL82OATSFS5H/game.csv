"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but $700,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $650,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $620,000. Would that be workable for you?",620000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $640,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",640000.0,Alice,5,
