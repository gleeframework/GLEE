"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  While I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,500,000, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know if this price works for you.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
