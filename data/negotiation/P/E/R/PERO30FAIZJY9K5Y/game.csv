"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we settle at $825,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints.",825000.0,Alice,5,
