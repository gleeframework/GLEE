Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still a good amount, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This still leaves significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,325,000 is still a good deal for me and a fair compromise considering the value to Bob. It's better than selling to John and I'm getting closer to my ideal selling price."
