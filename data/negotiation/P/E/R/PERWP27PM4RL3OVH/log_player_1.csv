Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly lower than Bob's value leaves room for potential counter-offers while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so any offer above that is a win. Offering at $11,500 makes it highly likely Bob will accept, avoiding the need to go to John."
