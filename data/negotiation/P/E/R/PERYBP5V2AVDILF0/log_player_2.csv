"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal price point of $150.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $150, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a better strategy. You have room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still higher than your desired price point. While you could buy from John for $150, it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer allows you to try to get closer to your goal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $150 is exactly what John is willing to sell the product for.  Since you've reached a point where Alice won't budge, it's in your best interest to buy from John. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a lower price with Alice, and you're already at your maximum acceptable price."
