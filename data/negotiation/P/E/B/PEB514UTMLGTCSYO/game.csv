"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about making this work. However, $700,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I can offer it to you for $850,000, which is the lowest I can go without compromising my profit margin. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to make my final offer at $780,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  Let me know if this works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal, Bob. However, $780,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and $850,000, which would be $815,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",815000.0,Alice,7,
