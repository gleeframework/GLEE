"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's try $900,000.  This gives you a significant discount and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
