"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'll sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm a bit of a budget-conscious buyer, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a serious effort to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we discuss a price of $10,000? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. I'm getting closer to a price that works for me, but I'd like to try to get even closer to my target. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,200? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and it's closer to your target than your previous offer.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is the same price I offered earlier. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit repetitive. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. How about we meet at $9,250? It's still a bit higher than your previous offer, but it's a compromise that I think reflects the product's value.",9250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, but I'm really hoping we can meet at my target price of $8,000. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",8500.0,Bob,10,
