"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $12,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and Alice's initial offer is at that price.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable value, hoping to strike a deal quickly. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Bob is serious about buying while also trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but Bob can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to go slightly higher than his previous offer, but still below Alice's offer. This shows flexibility while also trying to close the gap. It's a good strategy to steadily increase the offer without going too high too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to Bob's maximum, and with only 5 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, saving $800 compared to buying from John."
