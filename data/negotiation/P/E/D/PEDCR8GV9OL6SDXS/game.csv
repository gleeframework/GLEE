"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $900,000? This acknowledges the value you gain while reflecting the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
