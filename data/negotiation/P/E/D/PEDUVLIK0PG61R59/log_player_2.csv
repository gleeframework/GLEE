# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $11200. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really love the product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $10,000. With only 5 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. It's better to go with John's offer and get the product for my target price, rather than risk running out of rounds and being forced to pay more."
