{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is above my minimum threshold of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive language:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. This approach balances assertiveness with a willingness to find a deal.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm using a ""highball"" strategy. By starting high, I create an opportunity to negotiate down.
*  This strategy is risky, but it potentially allows me to get closer to Bob's maximum value, which we don't know. 
*  If Bob rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  If he seems genuinely interested, I might offer a lower counter-price, but I won't go below my $15,000 minimum. 
* I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me the security to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product,  $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. It's important to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:**  I'm counter-offering at $17,000, which is closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a huge loss.
* **Maintain positive but assertive tone:**  I use positive language (""appreciate,"" ""fair price""), but I'm also firm (""unfortunately too low,"" ""find a middle ground""). This emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, but also my position of strength.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly hinting that $17,000 is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle. 
*  If he doesn't, I'm ready to consider his next counteroffer. If his offers stay below $15,000, I will sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for a loss. 

**Strategy:**

Since Bob's offers keep falling short of my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000.  This ensures that I get my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may result in an even lower offer."
