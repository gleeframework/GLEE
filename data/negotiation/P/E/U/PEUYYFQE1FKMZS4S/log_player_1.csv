"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm starting at a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers Bob, making it more appealing for him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm framing the initial offer as a starting point, signaling that I'm open to discussion and a possible compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have already shown a willingness to negotiate, and by rejecting this offer, I maintain my negotiating leverage. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value this product holds. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows you to realize significant gains while acknowledging the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, but I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Focus on Mutual Gain:** I'm emphasizing that this price allows for both of us to benefit.
* **Firm, but Fair:** I'm remaining firm on my desire for a higher price but indicating a willingness to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob has come up significantly from his initial offer, and we're now within $50,000 of my initial counteroffer. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. It's likely Bob is firm on his current offer, and I risk losing more if I keep rejecting. 
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a substantial profit and significantly higher than selling to John. 

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures a strong financial outcome."
