"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's value of $10,000. This demonstrates that he's serious about negotiating, but also shows that he's willing to pay more than Alice's minimum. This should encourage Alice to consider the offer and open the door for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for a lower price. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but is now increasing his offer slightly to show that he's serious about making a deal.  The offer of $10,750 is a compromise that demonstrates Bob's willingness to pay more, while still staying below his maximum price point."
