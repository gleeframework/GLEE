"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
