"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is too expensive. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? This is still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's counter again and see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $60 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're getting closer! This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and our previous one.  It keeps the pressure on while still being a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $85? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow you to get a great product at a good price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her refusing and us losing out on the $80 deal with John."
