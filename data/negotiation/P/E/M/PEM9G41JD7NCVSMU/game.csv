"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a deal a bit better.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer you $12,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great price for this amazing product!",12500.0,Alice,5,
