Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Avoiding immediate rejection:** A lower price might be rejected outright, while this offer provides a starting point for discussion.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the need to maximize my profit while also considering the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I believe I can push for a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal.
* **Minimizing risk:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I believe there is a better chance of achieving a higher price through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I will need to be careful not to push too hard, as I want to keep Bob interested in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise for both parties.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This offer still leaves some room for negotiation, potentially allowing for a higher price if Bob is willing to budge further. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the price above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) while also showing flexibility. My goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price while minimizing the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. If that's not acceptable, I'm willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's counteroffer is essentially the same as his previous offer. This indicates that he is unlikely to move significantly closer to my desired price.
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly higher price.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is a much more attractive option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get a higher price, the risk of continued negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John provides a secure and efficient solution, allowing me to maximize my profit in a timely manner."
