"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer, but I'll keep in mind the value of the product to me and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still aim for a profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's a good price considering the product's value to me, and I've made a good profit. I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with John's offer which is only my minimum."
