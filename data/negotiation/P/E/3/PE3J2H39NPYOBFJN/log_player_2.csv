"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is still $100,000 more than Alice's value for the product.
* **There's potential for a better deal.** You can try to negotiate a lower price. It's unlikely Alice will immediately accept a drastically lower counteroffer, but you can start the process of lowering the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, it's still $125,000 more than you're willing to pay. 
* **You have room for negotiation.**  The fact that Alice is willing to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a price closer to your target.  By rejecting this offer, you can continue to push for a lower price."
