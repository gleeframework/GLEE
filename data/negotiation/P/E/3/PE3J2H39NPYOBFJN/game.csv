"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $912,500. This is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again, but $912,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,
