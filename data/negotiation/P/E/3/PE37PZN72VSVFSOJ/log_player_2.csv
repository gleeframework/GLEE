"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  How about a price of $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is within your budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal.  You can then see if Alice comes back with a lower offer, or you can always buy from John for $150 as a last resort."
