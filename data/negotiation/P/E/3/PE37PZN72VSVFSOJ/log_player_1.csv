Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  How about a price of $140?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($120). 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** If you start too high (close to $150), Bob might be immediately turned off and reject the offer without trying to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
