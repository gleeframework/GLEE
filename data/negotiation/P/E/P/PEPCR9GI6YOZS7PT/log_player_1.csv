Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach in subsequent interactions."
