"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This product really is worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a little too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems pretty set on the $9,000 offer and it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's not worth risking getting a lower offer in later rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
