"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation."" ,
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to maneuver and see how flexible Alice is willing to be. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $600,000, we are setting a lower ""anchor"" for the negotiation.  Even if Alice completely rejects this offer, it might influence her subsequent counteroffers to be more in our desired range.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps us gauge Alice's overall willingness to negotiate. If she completely balks at this offer, we might consider going to John sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the initial price.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this offer still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,200,000 is still significantly above our $800,000 maximum.
* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice's counteroffer shows she's willing to negotiate, even if her initial drop isn't ideal. This means there's still room to work towards a better price. 
* **Time Remaining:** We have enough rounds left to continue negotiating. We can try to get Alice closer to our range before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind. I could potentially go up to $700,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the value I see in the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  Instead of a large jump from our initial offer, we are increasing our offer incrementally. This signals to Alice that we are willing to negotiate but also shows we are serious about getting a lower price.
* **Justification:** We are providing a reason for our counteroffer (""the value I see"") without revealing our absolute maximum. 
* **Pressure and Time:**  As we get closer to the halfway point in the negotiation, we want to start applying some pressure. By increasing our offer, but not dramatically, we are encouraging Alice to consider a price within our range before we feel compelled to go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge that. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice's claim of a ""final offer"" at this stage is a common negotiation tactic. It's likely not truly her lowest price, but a way to pressure us into accepting.
* **Still Above Limit:** Even with the significant drop, $1,000,000 is still $200,000 above our maximum budget.
* **Leverage of John:**  We have the alternative option of John's offer at $800,000.  This gives us leverage to walk away from Alice's deal if needed.

We should call Alice's bluff and see if she's willing to negotiate further. If not, we have a good fallback with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this purchase.  To be completely frank, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price.  If you're able to come down closer to $800,000, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other option."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reveal Alternative:** We are now revealing the existence of John's offer without explicitly stating the price. This creates competition and puts pressure on Alice to reconsider her ""final offer.""
* **Firm but Fair:** We are stating our position clearly and firmly, indicating our willingness to walk away if necessary. However, we are leaving the door open for Alice to counter by expressing continued interest if she can meet our price range. 
* **Anchoring to Our Limit:** We are explicitly mentioning $800,000, setting a strong anchor for our desired price. This makes it harder for Alice to justify staying close to $1,000,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, reminding Alice (and ourselves) that time is running out. This adds urgency for both sides to reach an agreement."
