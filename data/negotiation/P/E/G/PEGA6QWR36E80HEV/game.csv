"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is truly significant, and I can't go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I still think $875,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, but I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Bob,4,
