Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $110 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100), giving me space to compromise if Bob counteroffers.
* **Prepared for John:**  I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good value while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), it's still lower. I can do better.
* **I have a backup buyer:**  Selling to John for $100 is a safe and reliable option. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my ideal price or at least meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price of $110 to $105. This shows flexibility while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, hoping to convince him to pay a bit more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $105 is still above Bob's offer of $95, leaving space for further negotiations if needed.
* **Maintaining my Minimum:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $100, so $105 is a strong counteroffer while still respecting my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. Considering my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price of $98 for the product. I hope this offer works for you and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** While Bob's offer of $98 is closer to my minimum ($100), it's still below it. 
* **John is a safer bet:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I don't need to risk further negotiations with Bob.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, but it will also take more time and effort.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, which is important, and avoids any potential for Bob to reject future counteroffers."
