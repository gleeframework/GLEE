"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to John.  You can counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You're only $50,000 away from your ideal price, and you can try to counteroffer at a price slightly higher than your desired price to see if you can reach an agreement."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $1,340,000, which is only $40,000 above your ideal price.  It's likely you won't be able to get a better price through further negotiation, and you risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  Accepting her offer is the best choice to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
