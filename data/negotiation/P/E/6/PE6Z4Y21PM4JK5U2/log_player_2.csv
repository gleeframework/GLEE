"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable opportunity and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000,  which is a significant discount from its true worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. We have room to negotiate down towards our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It's important to leave ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $900,000 is still above our maximum budget. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price. We'll make another counter-offer in Round 4."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer brings us closer to Alice's price while remaining under our $800,000 limit. We're aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to go down to $850,000 as a final compromise.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is holding firm at a price above our limit.  It's unlikely she'll go lower than $850,000. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer for $800,000.  While we could try to negotiate further with Alice, we risk losing out on John's guaranteed price."
