"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our negotiation, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still unable to meet it at $900,000. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints. While I am willing to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",887500.0,Alice,5,
