"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a great price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway again at $12,500?  It's a small difference, but it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500, but I was thinking maybe we could do $12,250? That's still a good price for me, and it's closer to my target.",12250.0,Bob,6,
