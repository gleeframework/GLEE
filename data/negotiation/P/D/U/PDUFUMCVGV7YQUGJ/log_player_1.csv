"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to the $15,000 value as possible without risking losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have rounds left, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would be a great price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Even though we're at a stalemate, I'm confident that I can get Bob to budge a little more.  Selling to John at $10,000 is a last resort, and I'm hoping to avoid that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway again at $12,500?  It's a small difference, but it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500, but I was thinking maybe we could do $12,250? That's still a good price for me, and it's closer to my target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to keep pushing for a higher price, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  $12,250 is significantly better than my minimum of $10,000, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get Bob to budge further. It's a good deal for me, and it's time to close this sale."
