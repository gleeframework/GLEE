"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay for it. I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140, which is a special discount considering its worth to you. This is a great chance to own a high-quality item at a reasonable price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further.  You're not obligated to buy from John immediately, so there's room for negotiation."
