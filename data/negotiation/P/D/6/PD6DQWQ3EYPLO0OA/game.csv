"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160, which reflects its true value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80.  Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle, how about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $140 is still outside my price range.  Let's split the difference and go with $100.  That would be fair to both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  My final offer is $120.  This is the lowest I can go and still make it worthwhile for me.",120.0,Alice,5,
