"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $1,500,000.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,400,000 represents a fair price, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice will hold firm, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
