Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message increases the chances of Bob accepting or at least engaging in a counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm subtly highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him consider the price more favorably. 

**Next Steps:** 

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter with a new offer, keeping in mind John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit high for me. How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($120), it's still significantly below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely secure a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, but I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and we can both be happy with the outcome. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Appeal to Logic:** I'm framing the $95 price as a win-win scenario, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging, hoping to avoid any negative feelings.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a satisfactory sale price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer, always keeping John's $120 offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  $90 is very close to my desired price range, and is just $10 below my initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, or we'll get stuck in a long negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting the offer, I can secure a good sale price and avoid the potential time and effort of further negotiation, which might ultimately lead to a worse outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Complete Transaction:** I'll finalize the sale with Bob at the agreed-upon price of $90."
