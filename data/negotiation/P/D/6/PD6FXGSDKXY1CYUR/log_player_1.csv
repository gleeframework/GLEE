"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial price point and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It's important to aim high, especially since I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  We'll see how Bob reacts to this opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept that right away.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and significantly closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a good profit, so I'll go ahead and accept it."
