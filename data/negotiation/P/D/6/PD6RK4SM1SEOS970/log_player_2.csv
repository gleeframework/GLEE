# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $12,500, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's latest offer is still above his maximum budget. While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll be able to get a better deal. John is offering the product at his maximum price, so it's a safe and efficient choice."
