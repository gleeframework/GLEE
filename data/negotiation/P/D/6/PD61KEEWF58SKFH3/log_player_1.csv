Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get the highest price possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. It gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly implies Alice has other options (John) without explicitly mentioning him. This can create a sense of urgency and value."
