"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The open-ended question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The initial high price aims to get the best possible outcome.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will provide insights into his perceived value of the product and his negotiation style.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but the $800,000 floor from John provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1200000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation is a Process:**  I'm willing to engage in a back-and-forth, but I won't settle for the first acceptable offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate and still have options (including John's offer).
* **Counter Offer Preparation:** I'll use this round to formulate a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $950,000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects both the product's potential and the opportunity we're creating.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I've countered with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still reflects my desired outcome. I've provided a justification (value of the product and the opportunity) to make it more appealing.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I've shown that I'm willing to negotiate and adjust my price, but I'm not simply giving in.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** Keeping a positive tone is essential to maintain a constructive dialogue.

**Strategy:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility but still maintain a strong position.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help me gauge Bob's real interest and willingness to close the deal. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  I believe that $975,000 is a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price and only $15,000 less than my last counteroffer.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain, accepting this offer is the best option at this stage. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Instead of spending more rounds trying to squeeze out a slightly higher price, it's more efficient to secure a solid deal now.
* **Good Outcome:**  $960,000 is a significant profit and represents a successful negotiation outcome."
