"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet the price of $1,125,000.
