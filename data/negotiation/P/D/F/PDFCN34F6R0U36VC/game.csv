"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This reflects the inherent worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is unfortunately well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, your offer is considerably below its true market value and potential ROI.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce my price to $1,900,000. This is a testament to my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to work this out.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
