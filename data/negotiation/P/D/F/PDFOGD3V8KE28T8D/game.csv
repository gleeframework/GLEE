"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer of $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm hoping you'll accept it.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a bit better for me. Would you consider $450,000?",450000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product at $450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $550,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Would you be open to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $500,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $525,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal.",525000.0,Alice,5,
