"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. Let's start with this offer and see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm firmly sticking to my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. I'm open to further discussion, but I won't go higher than this.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. While I'm aiming higher, I'm willing to consider a significant drop to $1,450,000. I believe this offer demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,450,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price is fair, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I'm starting to feel like we're too far apart on valuation. This offer is my final attempt, and it's a significant concession on my part. I'm willing to let it go for $1,350,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. While this is my final offer, I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a solution. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
