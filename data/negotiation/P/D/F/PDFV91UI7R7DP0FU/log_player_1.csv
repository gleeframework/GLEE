Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge beyond his $1,200,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome for you. You have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, so it's time to cut your losses with Bob and move forward with John."
