"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
