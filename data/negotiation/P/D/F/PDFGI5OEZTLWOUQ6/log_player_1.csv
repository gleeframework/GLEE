Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I offer it to anyone else. I believe it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so the offer needs to be enticing while still profitable for me.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning that he has the first opportunity adds a bit of pressure and makes the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
