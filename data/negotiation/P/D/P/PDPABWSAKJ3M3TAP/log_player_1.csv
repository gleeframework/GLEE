Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong offer that shows you're serious about selling to Bob while also leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as I have 10 rounds to close the deal and could potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you feel the product is worth less than my initial offer, but considering its value, I can come down to $1,050,000. Let's meet in the middle. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think the product is worth less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I have 6 more rounds to go, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,025,000 is a much better offer than our previous rounds. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1,037,500 is a bit high. I'll offer $1,030,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle once more.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,030,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge further, and his offer is still below my minimum price.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob is high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
