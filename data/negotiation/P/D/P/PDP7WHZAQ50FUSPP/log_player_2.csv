"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,400,000.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  While John is offering a higher price, it's still a better option than accepting Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $1,000,000, so offering $1,200,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will become less willing to compromise or even walk away entirely. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
