"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. How about we discuss a price of $14500?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $13000. Can we discuss the possibility of getting closer to that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a more significant concession from my side, so I'm willing to meet you at $13250. Can we discuss the possibility of getting closer to that price?",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a significant concession, Bob. I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to meet you at $13800, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll make a counteroffer of $13400. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",13400.0,Bob,8,
