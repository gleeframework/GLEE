"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  Selling for $102 is a good deal and secures a profit for me."
