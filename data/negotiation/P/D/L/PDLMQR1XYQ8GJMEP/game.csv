"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $950000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1050000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What's your decision?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
