"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm starting with an offer of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can we meet in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $17500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to get closer to my initial offer of $14000. How about we meet at $16500?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. How about we meet at $18000, which is $500 above your last offer? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to meet you at a price that's closer to my target. How about we try $15500?",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $17000? It's still above your last offer, but it's a compromise.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. How about we meet at $16500? It's still a bit above your last offer, but it's a fair compromise.",16500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, Alice, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I've been thinking about it, and I'd like to try to meet you at $15250. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,10,
