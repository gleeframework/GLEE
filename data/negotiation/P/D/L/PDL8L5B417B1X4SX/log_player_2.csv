"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal, saving Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation could potentially save more, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and ending up buying from John at the full price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
