"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm happy to offer it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still reasonable considering its worth to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring I start the negotiation with a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to make at least $150, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 just doesn't work for me. How about $160? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $145.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet at $155. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 155}
