Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, considering my budgetary constraints, I am unable to reach $1,600,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth risking a lower offer in the next round. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
