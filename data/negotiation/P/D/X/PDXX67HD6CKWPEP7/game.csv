"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
