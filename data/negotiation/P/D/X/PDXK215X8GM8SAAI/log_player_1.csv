Explanation:

Bob has been stuck at an offer of $1,800,000 and has declared it his final offer. It's unlikely he'll move significantly higher.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a real risk of the deal falling through entirely. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a  sale at our minimum acceptable price."
