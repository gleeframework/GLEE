Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my own assessment of the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my genuine interest in this opportunity. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals.
