"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that you'll find this to be a wise investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's asking for $1,300,000.  This is a significant markup, and Bob should try to negotiate a better price.  

Since Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, he has a clear benchmark and doesn't need to accept anything above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This would allow for a comfortable margin for you and keeps the deal within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is considerably below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,100,000 is still too high for Bob. He is aiming to stay under $800,000, so further negotiation is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. As a good faith gesture, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would still be a strong profit for you considering your own valuation, and it would allow me to secure the product within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal.  Let's settle at $1,000,000 even.  This is the lowest I can go, reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still higher than Bob's target of $800,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John at $800,000, it's the more financially sound decision to take that route and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
