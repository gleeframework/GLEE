Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This would allow for a comfortable margin for you and keeps the deal within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. As a good faith gesture, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would still be a strong profit for you considering your own valuation, and it would allow me to secure the product within my financial limits.
