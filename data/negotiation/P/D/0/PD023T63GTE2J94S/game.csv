"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that you'll find this to be a wise investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value you placed on the product at $1,000,000, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This would allow for a comfortable margin for you and keeps the deal within my financial limits.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $850,000 is considerably below its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. As a good faith gesture, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would still be a strong profit for you considering your own valuation, and it would allow me to secure the product within my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal.  Let's settle at $1,000,000 even.  This is the lowest I can go, reflecting the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
