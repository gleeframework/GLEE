{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,500 is close to Bob's perceived value of the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I'm confident I can get my desired price from John.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
