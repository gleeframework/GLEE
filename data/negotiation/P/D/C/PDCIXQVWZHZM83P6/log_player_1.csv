Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Considering its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid losing out on what he might perceive as a good deal. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a chance Bob might reject the offer.  You have a strong fallback with John, ensuring you'll still get a good price."
