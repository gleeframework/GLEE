"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, without revealing specific details that Bob could use against me in the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I aim to:
    * Anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.
    * Potentially secure a highly favorable deal early on.
    * Leave space for concessions while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy keeps my options open – I can always negotiate down, but it's harder to go up once an initial price is set."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which was expected. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to selling to John. While I could end negotiations now for a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000. This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring Above Minimum:** This offer is still well above my minimum ($1,000,000) and closer to my starting price.  It reinforces the product's high value.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By proposing $1,400,000, I'm encouraging Bob to engage in more meaningful counteroffers, hopefully moving us closer to a mutually acceptable price point. 

The clock is ticking, but I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better deal with Bob than immediately selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which shows he's still interested. However, $900,000 is still a significant loss compared to John's offer.  I'll continue negotiating, but I need to start moving towards a price I'm comfortable with, or I'll switch to John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement, Firm Stance:** I'm dropping the price significantly again ($150,000) to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal.  However, I'm also stating this is my ""best offer"" to create a sense of urgency and limit further major concessions.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,250,000 keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price, but it also gives Bob a substantial gain compared to his current offer.
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds. My message aims to push Bob towards a decision – either make a serious counteroffer or I'll likely switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I am willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Loss:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum of $1,000,000. While it's less than what John offers, it represents a reasonable profit margin.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher. Rejecting this might lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now brings in a significant sum quicker than further negotiation, which has uncertain outcomes.  

While I could push for more, the risks outweigh the potential rewards at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit."
