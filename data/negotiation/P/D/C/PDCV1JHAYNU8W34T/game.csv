"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 150. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 175? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Would you consider $160? That would be a good middle ground for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as 160. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 170? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",170.0,Alice,5,
