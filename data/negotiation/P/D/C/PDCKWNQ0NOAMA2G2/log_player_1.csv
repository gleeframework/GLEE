Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is a price point that offers Bob a perceived discount while still securing a significant profit for you. It's a balance between attractiveness to Bob and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $120 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob."
