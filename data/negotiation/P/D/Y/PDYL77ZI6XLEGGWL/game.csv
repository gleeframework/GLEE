"I understand you think the initial price was a bit high, Bob. However, this product is truly one-of-a-kind, and I've received interest from multiple buyers. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
