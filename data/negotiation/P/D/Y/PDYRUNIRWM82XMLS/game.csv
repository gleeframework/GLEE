"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
