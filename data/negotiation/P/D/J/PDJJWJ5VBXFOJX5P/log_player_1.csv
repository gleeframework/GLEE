"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high aims to anchor the negotiation in our favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a benchmark that's significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to make Bob perceive the product as worth a premium, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language ""proposing an initial price"" and ""starting point"" signals to Bob that we're open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy balances our desire for maximum profit with the understanding that we need to entice Bob into a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's seriously interested but trying to secure a lower price. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're aiming higher while giving us room to negotiate down strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings to the table is truly exceptional. Let's meet in the middle – I propose a price of $1,025,000.  This reflects a willingness to compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're showing Bob we're willing to negotiate by coming down from our initial $1,100,000.
* **Smaller Increment:**  This $75,000 reduction is smaller than Bob's $150,000 counter, signaling we're getting closer to our desired price range.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our asking price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're continuing to reiterate the product's value to keep Bob focused on its benefits and justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and would like to offer $975,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating incrementally, but we still have room to maneuver. While $975,000 is tempting, rejecting this offer:

* **Maintains Pressure:**  It signals we're not settling quickly and believe the product is worth more.
* **Allows for a Calculated Counter:** We can use the next round to make a smaller concession, showing flexibility while inching closer to a price we're happy with. 

We're aiming for a balance: keeping Bob engaged while maximizing our potential profit above John's guaranteed $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. Let's make this happen – I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it reflects the true value and potential of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a larger concession this round ($25,000) to signal we're serious about closing the deal and meeting Bob closer to his price range.
* **Psychological Price Point:** Offering $1,000,000 creates a strong psychological anchor. It's a round number that feels substantial and might be harder for Bob to resist.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're again tying the price to the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential return on his investment.

This offer aims to create a sense of urgency while still securing a price significantly above our fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my assessment and financial constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $980,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $980,000 is a substantial profit margin ($180,000 above our minimum) and a good outcome for us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's counteroffers are increasing in smaller increments, suggesting we're nearing his upper limit. Further negotiation might yield only minimal gains.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation increases the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Bob could walk away, or external factors might change his circumstances.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing a favorable deal that's already on the table."
