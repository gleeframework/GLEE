Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,150,000) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the wording leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, potentially pushing the price closer to $1,200,000.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while considering Bob's valuation and your guaranteed alternative."
