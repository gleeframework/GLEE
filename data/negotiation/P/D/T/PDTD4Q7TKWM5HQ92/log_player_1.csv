Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($120) leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get more than his perceived value of $100.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting a ""great deal"" to entice Bob without revealing your bottom line."
