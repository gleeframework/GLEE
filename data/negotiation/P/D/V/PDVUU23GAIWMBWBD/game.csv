"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and leaves some room for you to make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  If you're serious about buying, let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's within our budget and gives you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
