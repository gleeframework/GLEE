* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John**, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price.** 
* **A counteroffer will allow Bob to potentially get a better deal.**"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  If you're serious about buying, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to a price Bob is comfortable with**, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price once again.**
* **A counteroffer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a price closer to his target.**"
