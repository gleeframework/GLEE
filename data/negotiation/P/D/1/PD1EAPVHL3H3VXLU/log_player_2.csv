"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $60 is a bit low for me. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but $80 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100, and sticking to your $80 maximum ensures you get the best possible deal."
