"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your valuation of $800,000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and our costs, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being closer to your budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. I hope you'll consider this final offer, as I'm ready to finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a challenging offer for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value I've already compromised, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'm prepared to explore other options, including selling to John for the full $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
