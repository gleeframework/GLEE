Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's important to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $120, so I don't want to get too greedy and risk losing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $80, and it's closer to my desired price point. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I would prefer to get closer to $100, it's risky to keep pushing. Bob might just walk away and I'll have to sell to John for $120.  It's better to take the sure thing now."
