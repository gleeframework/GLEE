Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $99."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob will pay a price higher than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures I get more than John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price is slightly below my minimum ($100) to make it seem like a good deal to Bob, while still being a profit for me."
