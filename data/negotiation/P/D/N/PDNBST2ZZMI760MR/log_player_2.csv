"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than buying from John, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  It's a good starting point for negotiation as it:

* **Leaves room for bargaining:** Alice has some wiggle room to come down in price.
* **Is within Bob's budget:** It's still significantly less than what John is offering. 
* **Shows Bob's seriousness:** A lower counteroffer demonstrates Bob's intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now within a reasonable range for Bob. This price is significantly lower than what John would charge and allows Bob to save $400,000. While he could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the potential for a long negotiation process outweigh the potential for a slightly lower price.  It's a good deal for Bob and a decent outcome for Alice."
