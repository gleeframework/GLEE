Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is above my minimum of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to get him excited about buying it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to start the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Proposition:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum of $120, but it's not as high as I'd like.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $140 while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to ensure I'm getting a good deal for my product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product to justify the slightly higher price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable and open to a successful conclusion.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both of our needs, while still maximizing my potential profit."
