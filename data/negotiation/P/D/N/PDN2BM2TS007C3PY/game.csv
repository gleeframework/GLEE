"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of starting at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a bit less. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. This is a premium product with significant value, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I can offer it to you for $1,125,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the value to me and the price I'm able to pay, I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more small concession. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've made my best offer.  This product is valuable, but I'm simply not able to pay any more.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you've made your best offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
