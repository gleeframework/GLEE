"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's lower than our maximum budget, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  I'm offering $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate a little further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about we meet in the middle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current offer. It keeps the negotiation moving while still targeting a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm still not quite there with your offer.  How about $10,250? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is making very small concessions, and we are now very close to John's price. It's unlikely we will be able to negotiate a significantly better price with Alice at this point. To ensure we get the product and avoid potentially missing out, it's best to buy it from John for $10,000."
