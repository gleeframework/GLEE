"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  I'm offering $10,500. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, and I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm still not quite there with your offer.  How about $10,250? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset at this price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
