``` 

This offer is a bit below my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point, as Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives us both room to bargain, and I can always fall back on John's offer if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still out of my price range.  My absolute maximum is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his offer of $8,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely he'll budge from his price. I've already lowered my offer significantly, and further reductions would be below my minimum value. It's best to move on and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get a price that aligns with my minimum requirements."
