"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm confident it's worth at least $12000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.  This is a fantastic price, considering the potential value. If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details further. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $12000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
