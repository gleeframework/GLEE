"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

``` 
It's getting close to John's price, and haggling further might not yield much more. Accepting at $155 is a reasonable compromise."
