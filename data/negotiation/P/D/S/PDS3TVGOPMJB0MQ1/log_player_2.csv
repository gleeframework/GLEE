"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's initial offer is too high. The product is only worth $120 to you, and you can always buy it from John at that price. It makes sense to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That price is a little steep for me though. Would you consider $100?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $150 is a bit steep, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice is moving closer to your ideal price, you're still losing out on potential savings. There's room to negotiate further, especially since you have John as a backup option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we say $115? I think that's a fair price for the product's value 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115. Accepting this offer saves you $5 compared to buying from John and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
