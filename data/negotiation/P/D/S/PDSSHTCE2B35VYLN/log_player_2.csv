"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims to be meeting you halfway, it's still not a good deal for you. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to the middle. Considering your maximum value of $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the minimum value I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still slightly above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You can either attempt to counteroffer again, or consider buying from John for $1,200,000.  Since you only have a limited budget, it might be wise to avoid exceeding it."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget.  This price would allow us both to make a fair deal. I believe this is the best option for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1250000. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1225000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than your budget of $1,200,000. You have already attempted to negotiate further, and it's likely that any additional counteroffers will continue to be rejected by Alice.  At this point, it makes more sense to purchase the product from John at your maximum budget of $1,200,000."
