"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true worth of its capabilities.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a steal for a product of this caliber.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $8,000. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $8,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fantastic deal for something that will benefit you greatly.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and make this happen.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a significant discount and my absolute bottom line.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're committed to this price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,8,
