"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $75.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $82 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $78. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $81 is still a bit more than I can pay. If you are truly willing to meet halfway, I'm willing to go up to $79. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",79.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $79 is a bit lower than my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $80.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a middle ground. While $80.50 is closer to my target, I can only go up to $79.50. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal.",79.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $79.50 is a bit lower than my original price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $80.25. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",80.25,Alice,9,
