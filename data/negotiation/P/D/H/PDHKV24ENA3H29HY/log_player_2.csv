Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my costs. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $810,000. This is my best and final offer for now, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's price is getting closer to your limit, it's still above John's guaranteed offer.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her price not coming down enough. Buying from John guarantees you the product at a price you find acceptable."
