"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate a more reasonable price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I could go up to $9,000, but that's really my limit. If that works for you, I'm ready to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both are trying to get the best deal here. I'm willing to budge a little more as well. How about $9,500?  That's the best I can do.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to budge, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground.  While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $9,750.  That's the absolute highest I can go.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my time to continue negotiating. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is still above your previous offer of $9,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,9,
