"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it's closer to the value I know the product holds.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
