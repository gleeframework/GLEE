"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product,  $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit out of your budget, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's make this happen!",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is my minimum price. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,7,
