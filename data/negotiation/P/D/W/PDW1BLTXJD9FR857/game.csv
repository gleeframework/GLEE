"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $850,000 is your budget, but I still think the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $860,000 is your top budget, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'd like to make a small adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $865,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",865000.0,Alice,5,
