{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for you. I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.  I have 9 more rounds, and there's still a chance he might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000 to make this deal work for me. Let's try $850,000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a fair negotiation. "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  It's a good price, and accepting it allows me to close the deal without further negotiation.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll succeed, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a profitable sale now than to risk a less desirable outcome."
