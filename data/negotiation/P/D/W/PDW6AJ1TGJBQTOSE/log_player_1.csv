"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($120) and Bob's value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Confidence:**  I express confidence in the product's value to build trust and encourage Bob to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount. If he rejects, I can gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I have the option to switch to John's offer at any point if the negotiations with Bob seem unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  it's below my minimum price point of $120. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $120, but I'm prepared to move closer to Bob's offer if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price between $100 and $120.
* If Bob continues to refuse, I will keep adjusting my offers until I reach an acceptable price or choose to sell to John in a later round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $100 and my minimum price of $120. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm reinforcing the product's value to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies that I'm still open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping to secure a deal in this round but am prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum price point of $120, and I'm confident that I can't get a better price from him. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point.  It ensures a quick sale and guarantees a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and complete the sale."
