"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a competitive price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1100000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
