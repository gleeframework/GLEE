Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. While Bob is clearly willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer as a safety net, but I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm proposing $10,500 which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlighting common ground:**  I emphasize the idea of finding common ground, which can make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm still willing to compromise further if necessary, but I'm closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. While it's closer than previous offers, it's not enough to make a deal.
* **Potential to get closer:** There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to consider another counteroffer.
* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before selling to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still unable to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,000? This would be a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing $10,000, which is again the middle ground between my last offer ($10,500) and Bob's latest offer ($9,500). This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" for both of us, making it sound like a win-win scenario. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Avoiding a stall:** I want to avoid a prolonged negotiation and try to close the deal at a price that's acceptable to me."
