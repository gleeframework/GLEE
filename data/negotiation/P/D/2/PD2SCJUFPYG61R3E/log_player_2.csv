It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We've reached a good price:**  $800,000 is a significant savings from both Alice's starting price and John's alternative.
* **Negotiations are slowing:**  Alice is making smaller concessions. We risk pushing her away and losing the deal. 
* **Time is a factor:** We've used more than half our rounds. Waiting longer increases the risk of ending up with a worse outcome."
