"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting price. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than its true value, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we try something around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we both see the inherent value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to be realistic about its worth. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could stretch to $900,000 if that works for you?",900000.0,Bob,6,
