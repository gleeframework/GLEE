{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to try negotiating with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, as it shows I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm aiming to split the difference between Alice's price and my maximum budget. We'll see how she responds."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, although it's closer.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try again with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is showing some flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above my maximum budget. This counteroffer matches my maximum budget and puts the ball back in Alice's court. If she rejects, I'll be ready to purchase from John without further negotiation."
