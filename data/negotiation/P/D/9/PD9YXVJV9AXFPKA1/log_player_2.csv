"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Alice's offer is pretty high.  It makes sense to counter-offer and see if you can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and interested:** Keeps the negotiation friendly and shows we're still serious.
* **Significant but not insulting:**  $7,000 is a decent jump, but leaves room for Alice to counter if she's really attached to the $8,000 value.
* **Not too close to John's price:** We want to leave bargaining space in case Alice is tough, so we're not immediately backed into a corner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're not desperate yet.  Splitting the difference again would put us very close to John's price. Let's push a little further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to move up a bit, but $8,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Alice:** We show we heard her and are willing to compromise, which is important in negotiations.
* **Small increase:**  A $500 bump signals we're serious but holding our ground. 
* **Still below John:**  We're leaving buffer room in case Alice is really tough. This way, even if she counters, we've got some wiggle room before John's price becomes the better deal."
