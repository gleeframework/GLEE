"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000).  This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a good price, and I'll accept it."
