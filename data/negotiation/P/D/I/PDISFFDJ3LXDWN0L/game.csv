"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1800000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectations.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current financial situation, I am unable to meet $1900000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1750000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1750000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment and offer the product at $1850000.  This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility and the reduction in price. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to meet $1850000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1775000. I hope this aligns closer to your expectations.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
