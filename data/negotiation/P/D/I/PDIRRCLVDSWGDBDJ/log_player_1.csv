Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have a strong fallback position.  Your goal is to see if Bob will pay a premium over his perceived value ($1,000,000) without exceeding John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * **For Bob:** He gets the product for $50,000 less than your guaranteed sale price.
    * **For You:** You earn $150,000 more than Bob's initial perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially allowing you to negotiate an even higher price."
