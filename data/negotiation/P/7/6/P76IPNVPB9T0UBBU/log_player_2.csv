"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time opportunity. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you really want this product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and $13,500 is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further or that John will become unavailable. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with."
