Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. "", ""product_price"": 11500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($11,500) allows space for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring you're significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Value:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so securing a deal quickly with Bob at a higher price is advantageous."
