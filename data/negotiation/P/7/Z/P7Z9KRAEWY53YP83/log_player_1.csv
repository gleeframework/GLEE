Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to go that low yet, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
