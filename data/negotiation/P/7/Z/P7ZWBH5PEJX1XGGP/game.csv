"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. To start, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fantastic opportunity for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will deliver substantial returns for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from its true worth, and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
