"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $825000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
