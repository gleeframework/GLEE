Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000.
