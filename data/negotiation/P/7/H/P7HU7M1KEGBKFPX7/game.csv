"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $1,125,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. How about $1,175,000? This would be a good middle ground and ensure a win-win scenario for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $1,150,000 as my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and would leave us both with a fair outcome.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
