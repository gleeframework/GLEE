"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,150,000 is close, but I'm still determined to get a price closer to $1,200,000.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I believe I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
