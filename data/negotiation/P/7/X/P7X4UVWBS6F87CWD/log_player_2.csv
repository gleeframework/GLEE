Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit too high for you, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer and seems unlikely to drop below $120. It's clear that getting a price significantly lower than this will be difficult. Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
