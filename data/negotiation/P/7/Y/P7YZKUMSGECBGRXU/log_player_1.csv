Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **John as Leverage:**  The fact that I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. 

**Important Notes:**

*  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. 
*  The goal is to find a price where we both feel like we've gotten a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's still interested. There's still room to negotiate.
* **John is Still an Option:**  I have John as a fallback buyer, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Step:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or perhaps a compromise in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Still Profitable:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as fair to both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise and we can finalize the deal. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
