Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $122 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and it's better to secure the product at John's price of $120 than risk not reaching an agreement with Alice."
