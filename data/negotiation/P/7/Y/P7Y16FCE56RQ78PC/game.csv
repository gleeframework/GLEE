"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $950,000 for the product? I think this is closer to its fair market value and still within your acceptable range.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This offer still gives you a substantial discount and ensures I can achieve a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
