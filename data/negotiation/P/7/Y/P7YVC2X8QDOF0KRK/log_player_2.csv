"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price or move to a different seller."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let me know if that sounds better. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows him to explore those options."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than previous offers, it's still not a good deal for Bob. At this point, Bob has the option to continue negotiating with Alice or simply buy from John, who offers the product for his desired price.  The most logical decision is to go with the sure thing and buy from John, ensuring he gets the product for the best possible price."
