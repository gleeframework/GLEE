"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my minimum selling price.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me and your own minimum, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $950,000?  That's still a significant gain for you and allows me to stay above my minimum.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'd like to see if she's willing to go even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which gives you a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my price range. This seems like a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
