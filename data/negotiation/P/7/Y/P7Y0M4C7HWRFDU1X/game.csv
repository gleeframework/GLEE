"Bob, I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my minimum selling price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to me and your own minimum, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $950,000?  That's still a significant gain for you and allows me to stay above my minimum.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which gives you a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my price range. This seems like a good middle ground for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
