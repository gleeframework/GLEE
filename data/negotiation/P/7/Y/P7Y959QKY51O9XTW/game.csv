"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your best offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it could bring to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to acknowledge the value of this product.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and move forward.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Bob,6,
