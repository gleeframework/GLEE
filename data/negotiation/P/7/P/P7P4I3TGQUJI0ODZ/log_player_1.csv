"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see what Bob's reaction is before deciding if I need to adjust my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $95 is very close to my desired price. While I could try to push for a little more, I'm not sure if I can get any higher in the remaining rounds. It's safer to accept his offer now and secure a good sale."
