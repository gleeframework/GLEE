"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $80, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $90? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to let it go at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $90.  Since you can get the product from John for $80, it makes more financial sense to take that offer."
