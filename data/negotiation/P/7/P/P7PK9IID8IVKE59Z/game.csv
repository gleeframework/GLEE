"Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $80, and I'm willing to compromise to make a sale.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $90? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to let it go at this price.",90.0,Alice,5,
