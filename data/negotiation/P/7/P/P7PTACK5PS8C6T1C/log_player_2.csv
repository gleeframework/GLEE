"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is too high.  It's significantly above my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a good price, I'm not comfortable going any higher. Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, it's a better deal for me.  I'll choose to buy from John."
