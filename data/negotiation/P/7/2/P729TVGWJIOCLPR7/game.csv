"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's still a bit higher than what you initially offered, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
