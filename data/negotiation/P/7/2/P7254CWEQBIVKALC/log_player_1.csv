Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a deal at $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering the product just below John's buying price creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,190,000 leaves room for negotiation but still represents significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John is ready to buy at Alice's desired price provides leverage. Highlighting this subtly increases the pressure on Bob to act quickly."
