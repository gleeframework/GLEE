"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to me is much higher.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the product's true value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price."
