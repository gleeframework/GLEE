"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for you and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's keep the conversation going.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your offer of $1,300,000, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure. How about $1,325,000? This reflects a significant compromise from my side, and it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's make this final offer work.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
