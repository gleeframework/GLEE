"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and a price point that is a fair compromise between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation while still offering a decent profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate for a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great product and I think you'll be happy with it at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $92,  If you can meet me there, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, I might lose him as a buyer and end up selling to John for a lower price."
