Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm initially offering it to you for $19,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident in its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $19,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, he's likely to stay closer to this initial price than if you started lower.
* **Justification:**  While you don't want to reveal your minimum price, vaguely mentioning the ""significant value"" of the product might pique Bob's interest and justify the high initial offer. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your walk-away point is $12,000 (from John), so use that knowledge to guide your negotiations."
