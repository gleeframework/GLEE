{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I believe you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to participate in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still above your minimum value of $10,000, but it's significantly lower than your initial offer. It's worth exploring whether you can get closer to your desired price by counter-offering.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:** 

This counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintains a price above your minimum value. The message emphasizes the compromise and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to your minimum value of $10,000.  It's a good deal for you, considering you have another buyer ready to pay $10,000. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk of Bob walking away and you being stuck with the lower price from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is satisfactory, and eliminates the risk of losing the deal entirely."
