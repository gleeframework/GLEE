"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's worth to you ($120). You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high. How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
