"Bob, I have a very unique product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000 as a compromise. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1200000. However, that's still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1075000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1075000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
