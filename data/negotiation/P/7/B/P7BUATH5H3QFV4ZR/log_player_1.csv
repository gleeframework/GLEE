Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very unique product I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a compromise. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down to $1200000. However, that's still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1075000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal from Bob if I keep negotiating, but I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the deal with John and move on."
