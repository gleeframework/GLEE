"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $120.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's value of $120. A $130 counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, while still being within Bob's budget.  This is a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I had a slightly higher price in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:**  $135 is within Bob's budget of $150 and is a reasonable compromise, considering Alice's initial offer of $140 and Bob's counteroffer of $130. 
* **Time:**  While there's a slight chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting future offers or running out of rounds. 
* **Alternative:**  The alternative is to buy from John for $150, which is more expensive.

Accepting the offer at $135 secures the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation or having to pay more to John."
