Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to Bob. I'm trying to build rapport and encourage him to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that's not too aggressive, I'm hoping to:

* Avoid immediately pushing Bob away.
* Open the door for negotiation.
* Encourage him to make a counteroffer if he's interested. 

This strategy gives me the best chance to get a good price while keeping the negotiation open.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll adjust my next counteroffer based on his response and my assessment of his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues my product. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* Maintain my position: It shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* Continue negotiation: It keeps the door open for a more agreeable outcome.
* Potentially get a better counteroffer: Bob might be willing to increase his offer if he sees I'm firm on my bottom line. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I aim to reach a price that's closer to my desired outcome while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. It's still significantly higher than my minimum price of $800,000 but shows flexibility.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while maintaining my stance. I'm aiming for a win-win situation, emphasizing the value Bob receives even at $850,000. 

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still being reasonable, I hope to:

* Show Bob I'm serious about negotiating.
* Increase the likelihood of a successful deal.
* Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise further.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above my budget, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $800,000 I can get from John.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as it's unclear how much he's willing to increase his offer. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John provides the following advantages:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** It ensures I receive my minimum desired profit.
* **Less Risk:** It avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time Efficiency:** It allows me to move on without prolonged negotiation.

In this situation, selling to John is the most practical and financially secure option, even though it's slightly less than my preferred price."
