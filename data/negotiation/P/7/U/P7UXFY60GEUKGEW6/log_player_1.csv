{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us.  My initial offer is $900,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. My counteroffer is $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price range. Bob clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure this deal is mutually beneficial. I'm prepared to lower my price slightly, but  $850,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. My counteroffer is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is equal to John's offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair price and I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the deal and prevents further risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob or the possibility of losing the deal altogether."
