{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget, and there's no reason to accept it right away. He should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob should start with a low offer, close to his maximum budget. This will signal his seriousness and leave room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice seems open to lowering the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to show he's serious about buying the product but still maintain room for negotiation.  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering he's already rejected a $10,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already shown he's willing to pay close to $9,000.  Alice's offer is only $500 more than that, and he's nearing his budget. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and he risks losing the product to another buyer."
