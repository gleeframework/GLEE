Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm under time pressure, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This still leaves you with a profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, time is running out, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, so I'll take that option."
