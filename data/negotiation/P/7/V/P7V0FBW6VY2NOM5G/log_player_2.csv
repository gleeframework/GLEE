"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $150.** You should try to negotiate a lower price.
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to bargain.** There's no need to rush into an offer that's not favorable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  You're opening with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable margin:**  $105 leaves room for Alice to counter while still allowing you to get the product below your maximum price. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and polite, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I really want to make a deal happen. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price.** You're aiming to get the product for $100 or less.
* **There are still rounds left.** You have the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always buy from John, but you want to avoid paying that price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $110? I really want this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're acknowledging Alice's willingness to compromise but also stating your own limits.
* **Split the difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that shows a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Positive framing:** You emphasize your desire for the product and frame the price as fair for both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference was a great idea. However, I'm still a bit attached to the product and I think it's worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and $112.50 is significantly lower than that.
* **Negotiation is progressing.** Alice is showing flexibility and coming closer to your desired price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you keep rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price.  

While you'd ideally get it for less, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds and your desire to buy the product."
