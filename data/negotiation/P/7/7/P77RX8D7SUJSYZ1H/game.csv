,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm always willing to find common ground. Let's split the difference. How about $11,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, which is a fair price considering our previous offers.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $10,900 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. To make this work for both of us, how about $11,100? This would be a great price for you and allow me to close the deal.  What do you say?",11100.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit.  $11,100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,950, which is a fair price for both of us and puts us closer to closing the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10950.0,Bob,8,
