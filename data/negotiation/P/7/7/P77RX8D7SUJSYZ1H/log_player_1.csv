"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:** The offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me immediately feeling like I've lost too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, which suggests room for a compromise. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest. While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Positive & Persuasive Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing the value Bob would get by accepting the offer.
* **Reasonable Price:** $11,000 is still above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** There is still a gap between our desired prices, indicating room for further negotiation.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum desired price, but I want to explore if I can get closer to that amount with Bob. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm always willing to find common ground. Let's split the difference. How about $11,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,750). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fair price"" aspect for both parties, subtly appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Getting Closer:** $11,250 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant step closer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, which is a fair price considering our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it is still $300 short.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  There is still a gap between our desired prices, indicating room for further negotiation.
* **John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum desired price.  However, I am willing to explore if I can get closer to that amount with Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $10,900 is a fair offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. To make this work for both of us, how about $11,100? This would be a great price for you and allow me to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm making a final push with an offer that's only $200 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Benefits:** The message highlights the benefits for Bob by framing it as a ""great price."" 
* **Limited Room:**  By offering a price so close to my minimum, I'm leaving limited room for further negotiation, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit.  $11,100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,950, which is a fair price for both of us and puts us closer to closing the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where the gap between our desired prices is small, but Bob is unwilling to budge further.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely we can reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.
* **John is a Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the most secure way to ensure I get my desired profit. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid the risk of a last-minute breakdown in negotiations with Bob."
