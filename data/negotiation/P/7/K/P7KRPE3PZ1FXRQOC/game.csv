"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being more flexible with your financial situation. I look forward to your consideration.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another seller.",9500.0,Bob,4,
