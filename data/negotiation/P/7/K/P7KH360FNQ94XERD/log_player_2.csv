"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with her, as you could potentially get a better price. Buying from John at $800,000 is always an option, but negotiating with Alice might lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to buy the product. If Alice is willing to sell at this price, I've achieved my goal. If not, we can see how much she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down to a price closer to $800,000.  If she continues to be inflexible, then I will purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $850,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but I'm still firm on staying within my budget. Hopefully, this counteroffer will entice her to agree, but if not, I'll be ready to purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay less, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  Since buying from John at $800,000 is always an option, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product and save time and effort."
