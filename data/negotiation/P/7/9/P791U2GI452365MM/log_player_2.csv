Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, my product is worth a lot to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can do $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price range, I can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks missing out on John's offer."
