,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $18000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of $16500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $16500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $14250. Can you consider that?",14250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $14250 is enough. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to think about the value of this product. I'm thinking of $17000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",17000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'm thinking of $13500. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13500, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of $16250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16250.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer of $14000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $10000. Please let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,10,
