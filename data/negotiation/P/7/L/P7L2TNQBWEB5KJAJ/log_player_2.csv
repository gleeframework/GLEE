# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit lower, but that price is still a little too rich for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

It's time to cut the negotiations with Alice and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:**  She keeps meeting in the middle, which is a classic negotiation tactic, but she's still significantly above your absolute top price.
* **You're running out of rounds:**  With only 5 rounds left, there's a chance you won't be able to negotiate Alice down to a price you're willing to accept before time runs out.
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** There's no risk with John's offer. You'll get the product for $800,000, which is your maximum budget.

While it might be tempting to try and squeeze a little more savings out of Alice, it's too risky at this point. John's offer is the safer and more logical choice."
