"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find it for a bit less. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
