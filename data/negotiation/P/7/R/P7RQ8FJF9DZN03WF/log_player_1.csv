Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to sell it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher offer of $10,000 aims to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and I can then counter-offer or accept if it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I don't risk losing the sale entirely."
