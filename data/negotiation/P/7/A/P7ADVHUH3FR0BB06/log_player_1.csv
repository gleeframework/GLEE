Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's value of $15,000, meaning he has an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's a reasonable price, leaving room for both parties to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below your desired price.  You have leverage because Bob has already shown interest, and rejecting his offer allows you to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:**  This offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer.
* **Still above your minimum:** It's still above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Maintains leverage:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also have a clear value in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying for the product. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $500 below your minimum price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject his offer, you risk him walking away completely, and you'd be left with only the $10,000 offer from John.
* **Negotiations are time-consuming:**  Continuing to negotiate may not lead to a significantly better outcome."
