"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $13,500. That's the lowest I can go.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little high, though. How about $12,500?  I really want this product, and that's the most I can afford.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm really interested in your product, and I'm willing to go up to $12,750.  Let's meet in the middle, and hopefully we can reach a deal.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can do $13,200, which is my absolute lowest price. If you're still interested, let's discuss further.",13200.0,Alice,7,
