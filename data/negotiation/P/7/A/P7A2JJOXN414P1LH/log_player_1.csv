{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to be realistic.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see if we can find a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to consider your suggestion of $10,000, but I would like to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we possibly find a compromise that works for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating with Bob, it's clear that we're too far apart in our price expectations. Since John is willing to pay my minimum of $15,000, it makes sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
