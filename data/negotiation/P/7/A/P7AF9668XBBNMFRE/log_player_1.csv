"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer, but still leaves me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100, so I'll reject it for now. I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's still a good price for you, and it helps me stay closer to my target value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $92 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100, it's getting closer and we're already on round 4.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with nothing, or selling to John for $100, which is less than Bob's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a sale and a decent profit, considering the limited rounds remaining."
