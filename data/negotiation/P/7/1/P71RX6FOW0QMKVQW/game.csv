"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1600000. This is the best I can do at this time.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1600000. I'd like to propose a price of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000.

This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
