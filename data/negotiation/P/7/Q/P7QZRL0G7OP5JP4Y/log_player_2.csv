"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price point of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range that Alice might accept. It demonstrates that you're serious about purchasing the product but are also pushing for a price that aligns with your budget. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is very close to my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer, forcing me to buy from John at $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves me $50,000 and ensures I get the product."
