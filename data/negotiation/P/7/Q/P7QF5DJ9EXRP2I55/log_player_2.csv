"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is already above your ideal price point. You can likely get a better deal through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

You're starting with a counteroffer of $125. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's below your maximum price and allows for some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're better off continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

You're willing to meet Alice halfway. $130 is a compromise and shows you are serious about making a deal, but still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not budging much.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and you're getting closer to your maximum price point.  It's better to buy from John at this point and avoid further potential haggling."
