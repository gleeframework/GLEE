Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,200,000 from John.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get the highest possible price for the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a larger profit. 
* **Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale."
