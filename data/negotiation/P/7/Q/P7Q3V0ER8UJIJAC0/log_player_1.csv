{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's valuation, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than your minimum, leaving you some wiggle room.  This approach allows for a potential negotiation while still giving you a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I don't want to risk wasting more time. I'm confident that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll sell the product to him."
