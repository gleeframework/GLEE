Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this presents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We know John provides a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000.  Therefore, any offer to Bob must exceed this to be worthwhile.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **Balancing Act:** This price point attempts to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing potential profit.  It recognizes the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000) while still aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum ($1,200,000)."
