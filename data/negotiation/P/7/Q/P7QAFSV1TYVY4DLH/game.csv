"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $10000, which would be $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my initial target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to take a small step back and meet you halfway between $12500 and $9500, which would be $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $11000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to take another small step back and meet you halfway between $11000 and $9000, which would be $10000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10000. I'm willing to go up to $9200. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to take one more small step back and meet you halfway between $10000 and $9200, which would be $9600. This is my final offer. What do you think?",9600.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $9600. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
