"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
