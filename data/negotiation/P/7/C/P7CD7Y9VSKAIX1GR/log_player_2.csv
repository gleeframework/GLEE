"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $120. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150 (Alice's value), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a better offer than Alice's previous $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to get closer to Bob's desired price."
