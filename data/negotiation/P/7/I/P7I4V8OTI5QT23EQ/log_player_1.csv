"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even further from my desired price point.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unreasonable, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Time to counter:**  With 9 rounds remaining, it's too early to sell to John. I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:**  $9,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer but represents a compromise. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing that this price still gives Bob a ""great deal""  can make it more appealing.
* **Explain your needs:**  Mentioning that this price is ""closer to what I need"" suggests a willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time to counter:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I'm confident I can get a better offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows that he's interested, and I believe there's still room for a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and counteroffer:**  I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500). This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Fairness and value:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us and emphasizing that it's still a ""great deal"" for Bob. 
* **Open-ended question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer."
