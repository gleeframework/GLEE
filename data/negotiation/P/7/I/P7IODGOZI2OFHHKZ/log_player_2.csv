"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is cheaper than John's $15,000 price.
* **You can save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $15,000 to you, the goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
