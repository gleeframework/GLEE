"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would still allow you a healthy profit, and it fits better within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would give you a very respectable profit, and would be a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can do $1,050,000, which is a fair price for this exceptional product, and it's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
