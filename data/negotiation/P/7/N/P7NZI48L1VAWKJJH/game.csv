"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $725,000, which is $775,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final compromise, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  $750,000 is the highest I can go. I believe that reflects the value of the product while being a reasonable deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm impressed by your determination, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
