"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $25,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer. This allows me to potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the potential value of the product without revealing my own minimum value. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  The open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's too risky to accept his offer.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $20,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Polite:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but maintaining a polite tone.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $17,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. It's getting closer, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's below what I consider fair. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $17,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 18750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Fairness:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while also emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language that encourages a sense of urgency and finality, hoping to push Bob towards accepting."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $18,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm sticking to my principles.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to push Bob towards a more acceptable price.  However, I'm also starting to consider the option of selling to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't get me closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility.  $18,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I'm willing to come down to $18,500, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer to create pressure on Bob to accept.

* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm reiterating my need to get a fair price to justify my position.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language that encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum value of $15,000, and I want to see if Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $15,000 as it's getting close to the end of our rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $18500. I'm willing to pay $14500, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,500 is below my minimum value of $15,000.  With only two rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a fair price and avoids the possibility of ending up with a lower sale."
