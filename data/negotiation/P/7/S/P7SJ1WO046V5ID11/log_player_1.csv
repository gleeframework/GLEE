Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Sense of exclusivity and urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.
* **Justification of price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the price justification without revealing your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to accept. If Bob rejects the offer, we have the safety net of John's offer at our minimum acceptable price."
