# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving room for a beneficial agreement for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
