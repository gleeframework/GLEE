"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value but still allows for potential negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts before going lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I will accept his offer, as it's a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
