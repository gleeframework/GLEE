{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation.  Offering $12,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth continuing the negotiation process to try and get a better price.  There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to push for a lower price."
