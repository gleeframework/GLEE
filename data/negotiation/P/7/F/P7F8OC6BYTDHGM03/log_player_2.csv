"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I'm very confident will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price and might encourage her to come down closer to her own valuation."
