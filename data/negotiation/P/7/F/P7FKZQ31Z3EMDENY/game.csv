"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the market value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be comfortable with $700,000. This offer reflects a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $750,000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
