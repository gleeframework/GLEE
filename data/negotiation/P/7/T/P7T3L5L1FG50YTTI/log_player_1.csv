Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good deal and a significant profit for me. It's also better than selling to John and getting only $1,000,000."
