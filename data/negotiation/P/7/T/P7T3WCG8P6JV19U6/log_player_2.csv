"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a better deal than buying from John for $120.
* **Alice's offer is acceptable:** While you'd ideally pay less, the offer is within your budget. You can save $10 compared to John's price, which is a good outcome."
