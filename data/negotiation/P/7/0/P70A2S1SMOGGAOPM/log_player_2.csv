"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to appreciate your interest and commitment. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is overpriced. She claims it's worth $15,000 to me, but I've established a maximum budget of $15,000. Her attempt to inflate the perceived value doesn't change my limit.
* While $12,000 is less than my max, I know I have an alternative (John) willing to sell at $15,000.  This gives me negotiating power.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, I open the possibility of a counter-offer from her at a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value. 

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Alice will come down closer to a price that reflects the product's actual worth to her."
