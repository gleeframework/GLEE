"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between $1,300,000 and my valuation is still substantial. Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,800,000? This acknowledges the value it holds for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside of my acceptable range. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us to close the deal fairly.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
