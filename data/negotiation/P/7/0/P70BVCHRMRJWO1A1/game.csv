"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $13,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This price would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $14,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15750.0,Alice,5,
