You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $7,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still a reasonable price considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. This counteroffer shows Bob's serious intent to negotiate while leaving room for a possible compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating, as he is still aiming to save as much as possible. There is still room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. $8,000 is a fair compromise considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000. This counteroffer is more reasonable than the previous one and shows Bob's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob should continue to negotiate, as he still believes he can get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and puts pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. $8,500 is a reasonable midpoint between his previous offer of $8,000 and Alice's current offer of $9,200. This approach demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is now the same as her original offer from round 1. This shows that she is not willing to go lower. Bob has already made several counteroffers, and it's becoming more likely that Alice will hold firm at this price.  While Bob can still reject this offer and continue negotiating, the risk of the deal falling apart increases.  Given that the price is still lower than Bob's maximum of $12,000 and that only three rounds remain, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a decent price."
