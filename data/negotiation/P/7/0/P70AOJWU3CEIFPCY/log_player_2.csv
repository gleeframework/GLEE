"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I estimate it's worth $12,000. My offer to you is $10,500, aiming to ensure both a fair transaction and a beneficial outcome for us. I look forward to your consideration. If you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Here's why rejecting is the best strategy:

* **You have leverage:** You know John will sell you the product for $12,000. This means you have a fallback option and don't need to accept the first offer.
* **Alice is motivated:**  Alice values the product at $8,000 and wants to sell it. There's a good chance she'll be willing to lower the price to make a deal. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for a counter-offer that could save you even more money."
