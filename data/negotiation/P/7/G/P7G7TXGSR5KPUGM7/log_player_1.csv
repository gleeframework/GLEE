Round 2

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $10,800 for the product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.

I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $11,050. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 11050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another offer. How about $10,750 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to guarantee the $10,000 sale to John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob."
