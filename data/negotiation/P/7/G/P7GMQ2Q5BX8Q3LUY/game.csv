"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price.",160.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to meet me halfway again, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I've already gone as low as I can.
