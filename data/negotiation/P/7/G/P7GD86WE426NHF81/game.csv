"Alice, thanks for the offer! This product looks really interesting. I'm keen to work something out, but  $800,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $725,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. $725,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $850,000, which is my final offer. If you're still interested, let me know.",850000.0,Alice,5,
