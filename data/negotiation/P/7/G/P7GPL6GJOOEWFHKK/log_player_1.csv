Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so any price above that gives him a benefit.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $15,000, so I want to maximize my profit without pushing Bob away.
* **John's Offer:**  Having John as a backup at $15,000 gives me room to negotiate with Bob.
* **Price Point:** $12,000 allows for a healthy profit for me while remaining within a range that is likely to be attractive to Bob. 

This offer creates a potential win-win situation, as Bob can acquire a valuable product for less than its worth to him, while I earn a decent profit."
