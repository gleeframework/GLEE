"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer,  lowering the price by $150,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring Bob gets a good deal compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is still cheaper than John, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. Alice is showing flexibility by coming down from $1,000,000 to $950,000, so Bob should try to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice has come down slightly, so Bob is offering a price that is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows good faith in the negotiation and makes it more likely Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is getting closer to John's price, Bob can still try for a better deal. Alice's counteroffer is only $25,000 lower than her previous offer, suggesting she may be more willing to negotiate.  There's still room for Bob to get a lower price without risking buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to Alice's price. He's offering a price that is only $25,000 less than Alice's current offer. This shows good faith and makes it very likely Alice will accept, saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $10,000 away from her initial offer.  It's unlikely she'll come down much further. At this point, continuing to negotiate would likely result in a very small saving for Bob,  which isn't worth the time and potential for a deal falling through.  Buying from John, while expensive, guarantees the purchase, and  Bob has a higher chance of making a profit later on if he can resell the product."
