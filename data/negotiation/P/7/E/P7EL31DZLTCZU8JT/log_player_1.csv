Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $174. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."",
""product_price"": 174
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $100, and it's worth $150 to you, there's no harm in starting with a higher offer.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes ""quality,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:** While the offer is higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, it's crucial to remember you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. This knowledge gives you leverage.  If Bob rejects this initial high offer, you can always come down a bit in a subsequent round of negotiation while still staying above your minimum acceptable price."
