Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically helps justify the price.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder offer to Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
