# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no harm in rejecting her offer and seeing if she'll come down closer to her own product valuation."
