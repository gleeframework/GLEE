"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it can be incredibly valuable to you as well.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 unfortunately doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $850000, which allows for a healthy margin for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for everyone.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget.
