"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This exceptional value provides you with a significant savings compared to its original worth of $100, while still allowing me to earn a fair profit. I believe this offer strikes a great balance between value and price. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Since you can get it for the same price from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer. There's no benefit to accepting it."
