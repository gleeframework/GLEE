"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which reflects its potential for you. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800000. This is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000, Bob has shown a reluctance to budge from his price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob that could result in an even lower offer."
