"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $800000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects its potential for you. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800000. This is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
