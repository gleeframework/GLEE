"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $127.50 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you at $129.  This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want.  Let me know if you're interested.",129.0,Alice,5,
