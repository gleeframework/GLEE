"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than the maximum you're willing to pay, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room to find a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $87.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.50, which is closer to your ideal price of $85 and still within your budget. It's a fair deal, and further negotiation might not yield much more savings, especially considering the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then potentially increasing her price again.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk losing it altogether."
