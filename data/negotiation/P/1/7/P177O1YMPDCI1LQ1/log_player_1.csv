Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $110 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob feel valued.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message doesn't come across as overly aggressive, which could deter Bob from making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is higher profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Accepting $90 would be a significant loss compared to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is interested, and his counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate.  There's potential to get closer to my target price in the next round.
* **Risk-reward:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $90 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $100, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's counteroffer of $90. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefit to Bob of getting a good deal. This is more likely to encourage him to accept. 
* **Still above minimum:** $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $95 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer more, it's a relatively small difference.
* **Risk of losing deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only the option of selling to John for $120.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation might take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly higher price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation. While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good outcome considering the circumstances."
