"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. The product sounds interesting, but $999000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, given the potential value of this product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $999000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
