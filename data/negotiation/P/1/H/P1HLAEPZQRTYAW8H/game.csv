"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $150?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I can meet you halfway at $175. Would you be willing to consider that?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Would you be willing to do $160? It's closer to my budget and would make this deal work for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I can do $170, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",170.0,Alice,5,
