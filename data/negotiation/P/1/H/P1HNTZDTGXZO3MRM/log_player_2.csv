"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further negotiation."
