{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room to negotiate, and it also signals that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100).  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell my product for a price that is significantly lower than its worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to find a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
