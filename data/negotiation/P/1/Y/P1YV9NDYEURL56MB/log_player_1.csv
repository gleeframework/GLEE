It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,090,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We've reached a point where the offers are very close. Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium, and further haggling might risk the deal.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal with Bob. Accepting now secures the profit."
