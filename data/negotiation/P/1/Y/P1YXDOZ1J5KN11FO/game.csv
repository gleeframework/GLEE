"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at that amount.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $920,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out on this price, so let's make a deal!",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get close to your minimum price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, which is a fair compromise. We both need to make concessions to reach an agreement. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $960,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",960000.0,Alice,9,
