"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1,100,000. This represents a significant value for you, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the value the product offers to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, creating an atmosphere of collaboration. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started while maintaining a strong starting position. It's important to see how Bob reacts before deciding on my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept and move on, I'm not willing to compromise my financial goals this early in the negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm committed to a minimum price of $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is far below that. 
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds.
* **John's offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher price, giving me a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground while staying firm on my financial goals."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below my asking price. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Value emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob, reminding him of the benefits of the product.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to his sense of equity.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially get Bob closer to my desired price range. By showing a willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance, I hope to secure a favorable outcome without jeopardizing my financial goals."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, even though it is a good price for him.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before I consider selling to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** I'm committed to a minimum price of $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is still below that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds. 
* **John's Offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher price, giving me a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground while staying firm on my financial goals."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and willingness to come up on your price. While I value your business, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you a final price of $1,100,000. This reflects both the value of the product and the opportunity we have to finalize this deal.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this counteroffer as my final price, adding urgency and potential pressure on Bob.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm acknowledging Bob's increase in his offer but reiterating that it's still below my minimum.
* **Value & Opportunity:** I'm appealing to Bob's logic by highlighting the product's value and the opportunity for both of us to close the deal.
* **Fairness:** I'm again using the word ""fair"" to make my offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of finality and increase the likelihood of a deal. By making a small concession while remaining firm on my financial goals, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob continues to reject my offers."
