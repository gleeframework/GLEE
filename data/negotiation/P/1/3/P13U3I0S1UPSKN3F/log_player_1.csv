Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $22,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I introduce a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a decision more quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate further. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see the value in the product, but $10,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've significantly lowered my price from $22,000 to $18,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $18,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired price point, hoping to pull Bob further up.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Framing the offer as ""meeting in the middle"" can be a persuasive tactic, even though the split isn't perfectly even.

I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer while acknowledging his feedback and showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate, his offer of $12,000 is still considerably lower than John's guaranteed offer of $15,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Further price reductions:**  Bob's offer might not increase significantly in the next round.
* **Stalemate:** We could reach a point where neither of us is willing to budge. 

Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
