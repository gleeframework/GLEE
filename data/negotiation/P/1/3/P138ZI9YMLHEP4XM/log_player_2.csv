Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob! But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $99? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is very close to your preferred price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking further negotiation might lead to her raising the price or you running out of rounds.  Accepting the $99 offer secures a good deal."
