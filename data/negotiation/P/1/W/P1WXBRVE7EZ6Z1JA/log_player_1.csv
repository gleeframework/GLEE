Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Considering its worth to me and the market value, I propose a price of $100 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
