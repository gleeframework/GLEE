"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me first.  That price is a little high for me, though. Would you be willing to consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's still a good price for you and allows me to make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, though. Could we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $85?  That way, we both get a good deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can do $80 for it. That's the absolute most I can offer, but it would help me out a lot.",80.0,Bob,6,
