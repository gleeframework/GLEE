Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high asking price, even though Alice is willing to accept less.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative by asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" and implying a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Strategy:**

Alice is aiming high with the hope that Bob will either:

1. **Accept the offer:**  This would result in a $300,000 profit for Alice.
2. **Counter-offer:** This opens the door for negotiation, where Alice can gradually lower the price, but likely still secure a deal above her minimum.

Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
