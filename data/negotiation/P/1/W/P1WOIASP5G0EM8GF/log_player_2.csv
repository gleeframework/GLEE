"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, very close to your maximum budget and significantly above her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profitable price for her and a good deal below your maximum budget. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's still above your ideal target. You have room to negotiate further without risking losing the deal to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to move a bit on my previous offer.  How about $9,750?"", 
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate by increasing your previous price, but it remains significantly below Alice's last offer.  You're aiming for a price that gives both of you a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,100. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one. Alice has stated this is her final offer, increasing the risk of her walking away. However, her ""final offer"" is still significantly above her own valuation, and you have some room to maneuver before hitting John's price.  It's worth seeing if she'll budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made. To be honest, $10,100 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer at $9,900. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 9900
}
```

This counteroffer accomplishes several things:

* **Acknowledges the ""final offer"":** You directly address Alice's statement, showing you're not dismissing it lightly.
* **Expresses budget constraints:** This adds a touch of realism and might make Alice more receptive to a smaller concession.
* **Presents a firm but fair price:** $9,900 is a small increase from your last offer, signaling willingness to compromise but not at any cost.
* **Introduces the possibility of walking away:**  While you haven't explicitly threatened to go to John, you've hinted that alternatives exist if you can't reach an agreement."
