"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $10,100. This is my final offer.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made. To be honest, $10,100 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer at $9,900. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",9900.0,Bob,6,
