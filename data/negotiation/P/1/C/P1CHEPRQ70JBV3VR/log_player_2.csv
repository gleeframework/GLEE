"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, my budget is $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering your price to that amount? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1375000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal quickly, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1150000 is still too low for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1250000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!
