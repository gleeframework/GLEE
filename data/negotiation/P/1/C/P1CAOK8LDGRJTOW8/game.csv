"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $6,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $11,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product better.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is still below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $9,000?  This feels like a fair offer that acknowledges the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,5,
