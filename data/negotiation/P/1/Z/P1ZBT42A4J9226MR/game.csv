"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. How about $980,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $980,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet halfway again -  I'm willing to go down to $1,015,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm running out of room to maneuver, but I'm still willing to make a serious offer. How about $990,000? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to be careful with my budget.",990000.0,Bob,8,
