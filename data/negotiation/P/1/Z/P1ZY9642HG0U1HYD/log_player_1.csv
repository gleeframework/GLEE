Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1250000, which reflects the fair market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
