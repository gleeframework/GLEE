Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and also establishes a baseline.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter down, but only if his offer is still profitable.  I'll also keep in mind the $1,000,000 safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push him further before accepting or settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,350,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This should show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum and I'm not sure if I can push him higher. While it's still not ideal, it's better than selling to John. I'll take the $1,150,000 and call it a day."
