"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $120.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $90 is a good one, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $92, but I was thinking more along the lines of $98. I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $100, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counteroffer at $92.5. This is the best I can do, but I'm still above my minimum price of $100.",92.5,Alice,7,
