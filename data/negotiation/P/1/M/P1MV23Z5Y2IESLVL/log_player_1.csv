Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the value he places on the product ($1,500,000) while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  

This is a good starting point for negotiation. I'm leaving room for bargaining, but not so much that Bob feels like he has all the power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $1,000,000. This is still well above my minimum price, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a profit.  Selling to Bob for $850,000 is better than settling for $800,000 from John. It's a good deal, and it's time to close the deal."
