"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also ready to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum, it's not ideal. I'd like to get more for the product if possible. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a bit higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving the product away cheaply.  I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $160, which is better than my minimum and closer to my desired price. It's worth accepting this offer, as it's likely I won't be able to get much higher with the remaining rounds."
