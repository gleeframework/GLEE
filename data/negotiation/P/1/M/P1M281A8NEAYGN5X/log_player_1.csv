Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening that allows for negotiation and leaves room for a potential compromise. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start high and see where the negotiation takes us. If Bob rejects this offer, we can then start to gauge his true interest and adjust my offers accordingly.  Remember, I have a safety net with John, so I'm not under pressure to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  By meeting him halfway, I hope to encourage him to accept the offer and close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids further negotiation."
