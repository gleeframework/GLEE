"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm open to discussing a slightly adjusted price if you have any concerns.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet in the middle if you're willing to compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I can only go down to $950,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit significantly while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $925,000 and $950,000. I'm confident that $937,500 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again, but I'd like to add a small concession on my part. If you're willing to meet me at $925,000, I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $5,000. This way, we both benefit from the deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
