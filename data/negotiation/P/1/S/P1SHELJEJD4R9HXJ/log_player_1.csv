**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to $800,000, we still have room to negotiate. There's a chance we can get a better price from him before resorting to John's offer."

Bob has stalled at $825,000 and is unlikely to budge further. Accepting this offer is better than risking a lower offer in later rounds or accepting John's $800,000 offer."
