"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with an emphasis on the product's ""unique value and potential."" This is a common negotiation tactic to anchor the initial perception of value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating it's a ""starting point for a discussion,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000. I'll use the remaining rounds to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000 to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still aiming above my minimum of $1,000,000. I want to convey that I'm not desperate to sell below my valuation. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the ""unique value"" point to reinforce the product's worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my $1,000,000 minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but the next offer will be crucial in determining whether I continue with him or move to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm setting a firm tone by stating this is my final offer. However, I'm also offering a price that's a reasonable compromise â€“ slightly above my minimum and a significant decrease from my previous offers.
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** While this is my ""final offer"" for now, depending on Bob's response and the remaining rounds, I still have the flexibility to adjust my approach slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence as well. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Strong Position:**  By meeting in the middle, Bob has demonstrated a willingness to compromise and a serious interest in the product. 
* **Limited Upside:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 

It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close the negotiation with Bob at this price."
