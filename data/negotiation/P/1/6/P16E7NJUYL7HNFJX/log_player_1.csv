{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your valuation:** This gives you room to potentially accept a counteroffer. 
* **It's a reasonable price:**  The price is still attractive to Bob, and it's close enough to your minimum that a deal could be reached. 

Remember,  you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if you don't think Bob will come up to your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price and represents a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $1,500,000 and also lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000.  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  This price point represents a substantial investment on my end while still acknowledging the value of your product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm also not too far from John's offer, so I have a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $1,100,000, but that's still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
