"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is still a great price for a product worth more than $10,000, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that I might be better off looking elsewhere. I'm willing to make one final offer: $8,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
