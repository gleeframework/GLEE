"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds immense value for your business. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the initial offer allows for the possibility of a counteroffer from Alice that could be lower than $1,200,000.  While John's offer is a fallback option, it's wiser to explore negotiation before resorting to it."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. However, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay at this point.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially push for a price closer to my target.  It's worth exploring if there's more room for compromise before committing to a higher price."
