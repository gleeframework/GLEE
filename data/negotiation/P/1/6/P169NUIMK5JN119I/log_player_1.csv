Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product, I'm hoping to secure it for a slightly lower price.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I've determined for my business, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
