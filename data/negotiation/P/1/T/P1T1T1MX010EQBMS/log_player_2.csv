"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  You should reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
