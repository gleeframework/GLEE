"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards in its category. This exceptional item is worth more than $1200000 to us, but we are willing to start our discussion at $1000000. We believe this is a fair offer considering the quality and potential value it could bring to you. Let's explore how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to adjust our offer slightly. I propose a price of $850000 for the product. This still reflects its high value while accommodating your financial situation. I hope this proposal will be more suitable for our negotiations.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about $825000? This is a step closer to your offer, yet still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",825000.0,Alice,5,
