"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I've done some research and I'm confident that this product is worth a lot more to you than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I believe this product has value, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could go up to $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
