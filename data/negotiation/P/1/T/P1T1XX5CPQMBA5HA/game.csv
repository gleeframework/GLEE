"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me.  While I'm interested, $95 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to counter your offer with $90 for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",87.5,Bob,4,
