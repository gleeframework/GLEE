Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to make as much money as possible, and $100 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It opens the conversation:** By starting with a message, you can gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his negotiating style. 

Remember, this is just the beginning. You'll need to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than your minimum, it's still below your desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as you have a good chance of getting closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $92 is still below your initial asking price, it's a good deal considering he's only $8 away from your desired price.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure a sale for a price that's quite close to your target, minimizing the risk of ending up with the lower price from John."
