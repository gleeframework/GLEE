"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm starting with a price of $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A price closer to your minimum would risk Bob immediately rejecting and moving on.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is a decent offer, I still have a lot of room to negotiate before I need to resort to selling to John for $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about $90? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I can try to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $87.50. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $82.50 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not desperate yet. I have a few rounds left and I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot!  Let's meet in the middle at $85. I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, I'm still not comfortable with $85. I'm willing to meet you at $83.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $83.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call.  While I'd like to get a little bit more, we're down to the last few rounds, and I'm not sure I can push Bob any higher. I'm also getting concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum, and it's the safest option at this point."
