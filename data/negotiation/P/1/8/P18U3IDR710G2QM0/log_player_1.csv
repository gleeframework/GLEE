Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also ensures you get a good price. 
* **The message** is friendly and positive, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your earnings:** Starting with a high price sets the bar and increases the potential for a good deal.
* **Keep John as a safety net:**  The threat of selling to John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage during the negotiation.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The price is high enough to be attractive to Bob, but not so high that he immediately rejects it. 

Remember, the key is to be flexible, but firm. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't let Bob push you too far below your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. To reach a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **The price:** I've lowered my price slightly from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **The message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing my own needs and offering a compromise that still ensures a profitable sale for me. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Continue negotiation:**  By lowering the price slightly, I keep the negotiation open and avoid a stalemate.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  This demonstrates my desire to reach a deal, but also sets a clear boundary.
* **Increase the chance of acceptance:** $1,350,000 is a price that Bob may be more willing to accept, as it's closer to his own offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However, I must respectfully decline your latest proposal of $1,350,000. My maximum budget remains at $1,300,000. I would like to make one final offer of $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum.  

I have a reliable alternative buyer in John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the full value of the product."
