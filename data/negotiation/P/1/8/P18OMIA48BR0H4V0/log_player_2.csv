"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves me room to increase my offer in later rounds while staying well below my $8,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my range, but $8,500 is still above what John is offering. I'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to my limit, hoping Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm offering a price closer to my limit, showing Alice I'm serious while still leaving room for some negotiation. This price point is also a reasonable compromise between her previous offer and my initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as I can't get a better deal elsewhere."
