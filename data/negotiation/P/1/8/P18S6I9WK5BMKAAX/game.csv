"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering it leaves room for you to still make a decent profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable dropping that much. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $750,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground and get this done.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $737,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",737500.0,Alice,5,
