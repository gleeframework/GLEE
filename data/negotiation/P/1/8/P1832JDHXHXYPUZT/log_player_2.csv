"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal.** There are 9 more rounds, and Alice's willingness to negotiate is unknown. 
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  It's a guaranteed purchase at your maximum price, but it's not the best outcome. 

**Next Steps:**  The next round will involve a counteroffer from Bob, aiming to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** A significant drop from Alice's initial offer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially pushes Alice to compromise. 
* **Strategic Value:**  $750,000 is still a reasonable price for Bob, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Risk Assessment:**  This offer introduces some risk, as Alice might reject it. However, it's a calculated risk, considering the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation process, with both parties potentially adjusting their offers until a mutually acceptable price is reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 7 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases. 
* **Reasonable Price:**  $850,000 is a good price for Bob, within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**  By accepting this offer, Bob secures the product at a favorable price, minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential failure to close the deal."
