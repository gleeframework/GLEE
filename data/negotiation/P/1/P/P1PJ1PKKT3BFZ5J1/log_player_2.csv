You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a strong starting point for negotiation and allows room for compromise. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget while still leaving some space for potential negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. I want to see if I can push Alice further down in price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to my maximum budget. This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, I still believe I can get a better deal.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but by a smaller margin this time. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to go too far above my budget. This approach should hopefully push Alice towards a final price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'm only 4 rounds away from having to buy from John, so it's worth taking a risk and continuing to negotiate. It's possible Alice is becoming more flexible in her pricing and will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but this time I'm only going up $500. This shows Alice that I'm close to my limit, but still willing to compromise. With only three rounds left, it's time to start closing the deal and find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $13,750 is still above my ideal price, we're in the final round.  It's unlikely I can get a better deal, and John's offer is a good safety net.  Accepting this offer saves me $750 compared to buying from John."
