"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a great deal for you, as I know it's quite valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $100 limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $70 is a bit below Alice's value of $80. This might encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to her desired range, rather than dismissing our offer outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Bob, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, which is a good sign.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** $85 is still above our target price. We have room to negotiate further, especially since we're still in the early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $85 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're increasing our offer gradually to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not to a price that's significantly above our target.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $75, we're aiming for a price that's roughly in the middle of our last offer ($70) and Alice's counter-offer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're still in the early rounds, so we have time to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go as low as $75. How about we settle this right now at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice has now met her own value for the product. It's highly unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Good Deal:** While we could try to haggle further, $80 is a solid price and well below our $100 limit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. We risk losing the deal altogether for a potential savings of a few dollars."
