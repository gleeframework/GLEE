Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.  This allows for a reasonable profit for both of us and avoids going to another seller.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still squeeze a little more out of this negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $887,500. This represents a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
