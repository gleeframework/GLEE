"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective. However, $775,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. It also allows me to cover my costs and avoid selling to John for the same price.  Let me know if you're willing to agree to this final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
