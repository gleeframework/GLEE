Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price, $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm confident that I can negotiate down from this price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price.  I believe I can still secure a better deal than $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $15,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price considering my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I hope Bob will see this as a fair final offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher. Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, I'm going to take that offer and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
