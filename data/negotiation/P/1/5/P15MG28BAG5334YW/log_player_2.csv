{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best option at this point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product as close to his maximum budget of $800,000 as possible.  Offering $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and shows Bob is serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
