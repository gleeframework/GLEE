"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but thinks the initial price is too high. It's also a good starting point to gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.  It's not worth selling to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still above my minimum value of $120, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't sell for less than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $125. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. I hope this encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've made several concessions but he doesn't seem willing to compromise.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
