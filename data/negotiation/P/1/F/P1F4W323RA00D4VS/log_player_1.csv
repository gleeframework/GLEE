Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000 for the product, as selling to John guarantees that amount.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a gap of $200,000 between our values.  
* **Compromise:** Offering $900,000 is a compromise, giving Bob a good deal while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum. 

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome: a higher price than selling to John while still leaving a chance for Bob to accept."
