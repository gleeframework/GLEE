"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1200000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price for both of us considering the value we each place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
