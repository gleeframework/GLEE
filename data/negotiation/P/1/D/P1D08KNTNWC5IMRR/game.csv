"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll throw in some additional perks, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
