Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.

While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. John's offer is solid and guarantees I meet my minimum."
