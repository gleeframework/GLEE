"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my  budget and the product's value to me. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
