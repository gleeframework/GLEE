"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit out of my budget at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and allows for some room for profit.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $700000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the potential value it offers and allows for a healthy profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below a certain threshold. Considering your offer of $750000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
