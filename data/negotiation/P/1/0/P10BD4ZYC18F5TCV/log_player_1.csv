Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit out of my budget at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and allows for some room for profit.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.

Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
