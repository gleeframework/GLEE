# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to your company.  It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident it will significantly enhance your operations.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000, which is a substantial discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer interested in acquiring it for $800,000.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed.
