"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to be flexible and meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another compromise and counteroffer at $1,075,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,075,000.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,087,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1087500.0,Alice,7,
