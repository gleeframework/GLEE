"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to highlight the value of the product and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer. 

I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy for future rounds based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum, but I'm not yet desperate enough to accept it.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Play:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a better deal and encourage him to offer closer to my expectations in the next round.

**Next Round:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $125 and my initial asking price of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $135? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $135, which is halfway between my initial price of $150 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Urgency (Implicit):**  The message subtly suggests urgency by mentioning ""closing this deal,"" reminding Bob that I'm willing to sell but not desperate to accept his previous offer.

I believe this counteroffer will put us closer to a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 away from my initial offer and $10 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower price or more rounds, increasing the risk of a deal falling through.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, the time spent negotiating might lead to a missed opportunity to sell the product to John for $100.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
