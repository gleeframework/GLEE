"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth $1,500,000 and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. This gives you room to negotiate, and allows me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's move forward and make this happen.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  It's a unique opportunity and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth a little more.  Let's try $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and hopefully gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I need to see $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the unique value of this product and brings us closer to a successful conclusion.  What do you say?

It's time to switch to John. Alice seems firmly set on $1,450,000, and is unlikely to go substantially lower. While we could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice won't budge and we'd end up paying more than John's offer.  Buying from John guarantees we get the product at our target price."
