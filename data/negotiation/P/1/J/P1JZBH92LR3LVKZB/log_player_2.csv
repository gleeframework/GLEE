"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is too high, and he can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $16,500. This is my best offer at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to his target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice down to his price, and John is offering a guaranteed deal at his maximum price."
