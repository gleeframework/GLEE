"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $16,500. This is my best offer at this time.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I expect you to consider it seriously.",16000.0,Alice,5,
