"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $10750 is closer, but I'm still a little below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $10875?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to keep the deal going.  What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
