Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $10,000 is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $12,000, but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value to Bob and offering a discount.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** $10,000 is a good compromise, potentially earning me a good profit.
* **Increase the chances of Bob accepting:**  The offer is attractive, and I'm framing it positively.
* **Maintain a backup:** I'm still comfortable with selling to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects the offer."
