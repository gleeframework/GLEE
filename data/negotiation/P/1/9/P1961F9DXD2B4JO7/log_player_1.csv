This is the best deal you can get from Bob. While it's less than what you'd get from John, it's better to secure a sale now than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with no deal.  You're still getting a significant profit, and there's no guarantee that John will still be interested in the product in future rounds."
