"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $20,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I could consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my final offer for now.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet somewhere around $11,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be final.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still a little bit out of reach for me right now.  Would you consider $12,000? That would make a big difference for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my last concession, and I expect it to be accepted.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! $12,000 seems like a fair compromise to me, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500, Bob. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. If you're not willing to meet me at $12,500, I'm going to have to consider other options.",12500.0,Alice,9,
