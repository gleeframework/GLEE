Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit, but not too much. $130 is still above my minimum and hopefully, it's a more appealing price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal.  It's time to sell the product."
