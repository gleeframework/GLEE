"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1380000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere, and I'm eager to finalize the sale.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider your latest offer of $1380000, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1365000. I hope this aligns closer to our mutual interests.",1365000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1365000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll meet you at $1380000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1370000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1370000.0,Alice,5,
