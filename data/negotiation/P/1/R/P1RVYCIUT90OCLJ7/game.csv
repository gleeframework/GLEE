"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that I believe holds significant value for your business. I understand its worth to you is considerable, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value. This offer represents a substantial advantage for you, as you would be acquiring it for less than its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1000000.0,Alice,1,
