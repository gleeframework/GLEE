``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also expressing willingness to negotiate, which should encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I am willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. It is not worth it to continue negotiating further."
