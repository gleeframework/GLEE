"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,4,
