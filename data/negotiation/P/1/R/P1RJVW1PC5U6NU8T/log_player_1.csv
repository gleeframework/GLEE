Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
