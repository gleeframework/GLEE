{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $10,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You value the product at $12,000, so this offer still allows for some profit. 
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation:**  It opens the door for back-and-forth negotiations without immediately closing the deal. 

By offering $10,000, you're showing Bob that you're willing to negotiate, but you're also not giving away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875.

While $8,875 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more."
