"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11200, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11200 and my original offer of $10000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10800?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative math, Bob! Meeting you halfway between $11200 and $10000 would actually be $10600, not $10800. However, I'm willing to consider your revised offer. I'll meet you at $10900, but that's as low as I can go.",10900.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the correction, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10900. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go down to $10500. Would you be willing to sell the product to me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the price I could get from John. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
