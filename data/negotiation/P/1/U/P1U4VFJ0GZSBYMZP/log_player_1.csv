Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation, and it's lower than John's offer, giving me an incentive to try and reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob rather than John, $100 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
This is a compromise, lowering my price slightly from the previous offer but still well above Bob's initial offer, hopefully leading to a deal."
