"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value and potential returns. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
