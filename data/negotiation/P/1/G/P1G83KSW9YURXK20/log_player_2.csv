# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. It's still above your maximum price point of $100. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John as a backup option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You're not losing anything by rejecting and making another counteroffer, as John is always a backup option."
