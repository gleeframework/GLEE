{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price but below what John would pay. This allows room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $105?  I'm serious about buying it, but that's my top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but he seems serious about buying. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still only comfortable at $105. If you're unable to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and it's below my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm risking losing time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed $120. It's time to sell to John."
