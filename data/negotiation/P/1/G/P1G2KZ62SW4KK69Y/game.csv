"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $16,000 is a fair starting point considering the value this product offers. How about we meet halfway at $14,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
