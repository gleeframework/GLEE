Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?

Alice is meeting my bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and potentially losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
