Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and might even lead to you securing a price closer to your ideal.
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  You know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to you, so you don't want to accept anything less. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and gives you information on how to proceed with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,100,000, there's still room for negotiation. You know John will buy it for your minimum, so there's no risk of ending up with nothing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering your price. However, the decrease is significant enough to convey that you're serious about the product's value.
* **Aim for the Middle Ground:**  You're aiming for a price point between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable middle ground.
* **Justification:** By briefly mentioning the ""value"" again, you reinforce that your price isn't arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing negotiations or going to John, as both options will net you the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale at your desired price."
