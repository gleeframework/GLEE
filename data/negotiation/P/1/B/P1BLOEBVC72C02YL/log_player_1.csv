{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John for $150, so I don't need to settle for anything significantly lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even far below my starting offer of $130. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it does show that he's interested in the product. This opens the opportunity for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing a significant amount of money. It's better to continue negotiating or explore the option of selling to John. 

I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm highlighting the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not giving in completely to Bob's low counteroffer, indicating that I'm still confident in the product's worth.

This counteroffer allows for continued negotiation while keeping my potential earnings higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $80 is closer to my minimum, but it's still far from my initial goal of maximizing profit.  I'm not confident I can get more out of Bob.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, and likely more, with no further negotiation.  This is a sure thing. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on a better deal.

While it's not ideal to sell below my initial expectations, selling to John is the most logical choice in this situation, guaranteeing a reasonable profit and avoiding further potential losses."
