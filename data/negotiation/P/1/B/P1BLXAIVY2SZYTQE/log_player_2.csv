"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a price that's significantly below its true value. While I'm confident I could find another buyer willing to pay a much higher price, I'm open to negotiating a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you. Consider this a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
