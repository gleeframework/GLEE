Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1800000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for a good profit for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.
