"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's not guaranteed.  Since Bob has a reliable alternative in John who is selling the product for $10,000, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Alice."
