"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a strong starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to agree to a price closer to what I want. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $8,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this price is still fair while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not sure if I can push for a higher price, but I'll try in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is the same price as Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  If he rejects this, I'll likely have to accept his offer or sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob. He's not budging on his price, and I'm worried I'll run out of rounds before getting a better offer. John is a safe option and guarantees me my minimum price."
