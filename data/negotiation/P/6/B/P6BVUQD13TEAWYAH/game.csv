"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I think it's a fair starting point for this negotiation. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $22,000 price. I would like to propose a price closer to $8,000 which is within my financial limits. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to show flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $18,000 is still above my budget, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price closer to $10,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $10,000 is still quite a distance from what I had in mind.  Let's try $15,500 - I'm taking a significant cut here to try and close this deal. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to consider $15,500, but I'm hoping there might be room for even further negotiation. Could we perhaps aim for $14,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
