"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? It's a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,600?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
