"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, considering its value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is closer to your budget, but still a bit high. You can likely negotiate further, as Alice is already making compromises.  Since you have the option of buying from John for $10,000, it's worth trying to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,600?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but her offer is still above your target of $10,000. You've already negotiated with her for a few rounds, and it seems like she's unwilling to go lower. 

Since you have the option to buy from John at your desired price, it's more efficient and cost-effective to simply purchase from him.  You've saved yourself more time and effort, and ultimately, you've achieved your goal of getting the product at your budget."
