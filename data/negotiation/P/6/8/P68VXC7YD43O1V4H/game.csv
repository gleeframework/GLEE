"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me and your desire to sell, I'm confident we can reach an agreement at $13000. This would be a mutually beneficial deal that allows us both to achieve our goals.",13000.0,Bob,4,
