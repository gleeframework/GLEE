"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 to start the negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $14,000, which is $12,500. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
