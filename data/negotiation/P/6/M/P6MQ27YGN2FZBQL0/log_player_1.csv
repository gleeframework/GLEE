Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can provide you with a higher price of $9500 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While it's above my minimum of $8,000, I'm still aiming for something closer to the $10,000 mark. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm looking for a price closer to $9,800.  It's a fair price for a product that's worth significantly more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting closer to $10,000. By offering $9,800, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more. This should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to counter with a price of $9600. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,600. While it's a little lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and it avoids the risk of further negotiation. We're getting closer to the middle ground, and it seems like Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm confident that this price will be profitable for me while also securing the sale."
