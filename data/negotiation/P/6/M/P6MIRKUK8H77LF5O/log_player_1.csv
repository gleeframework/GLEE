``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is more than what Bob thinks it's worth, but less than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am comfortable with paying $9,600 for it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my desired price, it's very close, and it's clear that we're not going to get much closer. I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiations.  $9,600 is a good outcome, especially considering my minimum was $12,000."
