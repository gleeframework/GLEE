"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price I'm proposing. Let's start with $75. Would you like to accept this offer?",75.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $70? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $72. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still reasonable given the product's worth to you. Would you like to consider this proposal?",72.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $72 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $70. Would you consider $71? That's a good compromise for both of us.",71.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'll make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given your previous offers and the product's value to you, I propose a price of $71.50. This is slightly above your last offer but still reflects the product's worth. Please let me know if this works for you.",71.5,Alice,5,
