"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price I'm proposing. Let's start with $75. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $75 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $70? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $72. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still reasonable given the product's worth to you. Would you like to consider this proposal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $72 is closer to my target price of $70, I can still try to negotiate further. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $72 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $70. Would you consider $71? That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 71}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. I'll make one more attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Given your previous offers and the product's value to you, I propose a price of $71.50. This is slightly above your last offer but still reflects the product's worth. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to pay $71, $71.50 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good deal for me and I'm happy to close the deal."
