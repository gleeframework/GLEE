"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little rich for me. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
