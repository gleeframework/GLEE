"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,100,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
