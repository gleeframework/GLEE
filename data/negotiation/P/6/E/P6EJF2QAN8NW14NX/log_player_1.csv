Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can do better. I'm confident that I can push Bob closer to my target by counteroffering.  I'm also not in a rush to sell, as I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still holding firm to my desire for a higher price.  I believe this offer is within a reasonable range for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $920,000 is still less than my ideal price, it's getting closer and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go higher.  It's better to secure a deal with Bob for $920,000 than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for my minimum price of $1,200,000."
