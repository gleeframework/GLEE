"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product. It gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also showing that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, or I can sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with that offer.  I'm choosing to reject it and continue negotiating.  The time pressure is increasing and I might need to reconsider selling to John soon, but I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,000. This is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  Since we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations, and John is always a viable option, I need to be firm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John.  The time pressure is mounting, and while I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  John provides a secure and guaranteed outcome, meeting my minimum acceptable price."
