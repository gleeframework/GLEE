Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $99. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $100, offering the product to Bob first gives you a chance to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $99 is a common negotiation tactic. It's slightly below the $100 you'll get from John but significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80). This might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even though it's highly profitable for you. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, by starting with a price that maximizes your potential profit, you put yourself in the best position to earn the most money from the sale."
