Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,065,000. This is a small increase and allows us to close this deal quickly.  We've both made concessions, and I think this is a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
