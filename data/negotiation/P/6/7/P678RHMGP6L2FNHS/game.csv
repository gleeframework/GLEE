"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",880000.0,Bob,4,
