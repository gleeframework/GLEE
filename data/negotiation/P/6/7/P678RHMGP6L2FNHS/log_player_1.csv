"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to maximize profit. Starting with a strong offer of $950,000 anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that we see the product's value as higher and keeps the possibility of a more favorable deal alive. We have the leverage of John's offer as a fallback, so we can afford to be a bit more assertive in these early rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're signaling willingness to negotiate by coming down from $950,000. However, the concession is moderate ($50,000), showing we're not desperate to close at any price.
* **Anchoring to a Higher Price:** By proposing $900,000, we're aiming to establish this as the new baseline for the negotiation, moving away from Bob's lower offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value proposition to justify the higher price and appeal to Bob's desire for a good investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $880,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his latest message indicates he might not be moving much higher. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and secures a good return. It's often better to accept a strong offer than to risk losing it for a potentially marginal gain."
