"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this product. I'm willing to let it go for $140. It's a fantastic value and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. Since Bob's maximum is $150 and Alice's minimum is $120, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really think you'll love this product and it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer of $150. Accepting this offer saves Bob $15. While there's always a chance to try and negotiate lower, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and forcing Bob to pay $150 from John isn't worth it."
