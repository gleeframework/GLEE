Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **My guaranteed value:** I can sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation space:**  I want to get as close to my guaranteed value as possible.  Offering $900,000 is a good starting point. It's high enough to potentially incentivize Bob, yet still leaves me room for negotiation if he counters.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially get a higher price if I wait for a better offer from Bob, there's a risk he might reject it.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:**  By starting at $900,000, I open the door for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter with a lower price, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable deal. 

**Disclaimer:** This is just one possible offer strategy. The best strategy will depend on factors like your risk tolerance, Bob's perceived financial situation, and the potential for future offers."
