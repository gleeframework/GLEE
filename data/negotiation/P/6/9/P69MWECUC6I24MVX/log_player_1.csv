Round 2
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $145, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob is very close to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might make him walk away. Accepting the $145 offer guarantees a sale and still nets a profit above my absolute minimum."
