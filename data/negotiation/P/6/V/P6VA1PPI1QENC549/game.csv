"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price that still allows you to profit while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go.  I'm willing to offer you $14,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and it's the highest I can offer without exceeding my budget. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
