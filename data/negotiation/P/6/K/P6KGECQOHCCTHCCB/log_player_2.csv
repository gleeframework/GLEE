"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This is a good deal, but Bob can likely get an even better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down from your original price.  However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering our previous conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $9800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has a good chance of getting the product for cheaper if he keeps counteroffering, but Alice's offer of $9,800 is only $200 more than his counteroffer.  This is likely the best price Bob can get."
