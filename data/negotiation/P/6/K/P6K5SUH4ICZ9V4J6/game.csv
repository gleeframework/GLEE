"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you is $800,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 significantly undervalues this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,4,
