"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your time, I can't accept $1200000. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to benefit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1300000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
