,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $10000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we discuss a price of $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm starting to think about other options, but I'd still like to work with you if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $10000? It's a bit lower than my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $10000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to the price I'm comfortable with.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. How about we meet you halfway between $9800 and $10000? I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9900.",9900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. I'm really close to my budget, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower. If you're willing to sell it to me for this price, I'd be happy to make the purchase.",9800.0,Bob,10,
