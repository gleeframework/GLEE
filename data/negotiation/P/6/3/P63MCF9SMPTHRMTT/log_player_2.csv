"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a product that I believe you might be interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $9250?  I'm willing to split the difference a bit to see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price again."
