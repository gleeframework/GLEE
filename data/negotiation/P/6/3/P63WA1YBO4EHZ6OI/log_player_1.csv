{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling to him and willing to compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product more than worth it at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I've done some research and feel comfortable offering $9,100 for your product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing a sale to John."
