"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's a $100,000 discount, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **We have 10 rounds.** There's no need to rush.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This provides a safety net and a benchmark for our negotiation.

By rejecting the offer, we can explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  We're aiming for a significant discount, but not pushing too hard.
* **Room for compromise:** This offer leaves space for Alice to counter without feeling overly pressured.
* **Testing the waters:** We want to see how far Alice is willing to go in the first round of counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility.**  Her counteroffer is closer to our desired price. 
* **We're still in a strong position.**  We have several rounds left and a fallback option with John.
* **Aiming for a better deal:**  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, potentially in the $650,000 range.

By rejecting this offer, we can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 660000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer is halfway between Alice's last offer and our previous offer.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:**  This demonstrates that we are serious about buying the product, but also want a fair price.
* **Testing the limits:**  We'll see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway or if she will counter with a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're getting closer to our target price.** Alice's offer is only $10,000 higher than our last counteroffer.
* **Time is running out.** We've already used 5 rounds, and continuing to haggle could risk losing the deal.
* **John's offer is a safe backup.** If we need to, we can still buy from John for $800,000.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. We've secured a good deal and have a reasonable chance of closing the deal within the remaining rounds."
