Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $175 gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob (even though it's not the full $100) can increase his interest. 

This strategy aims to:

* Get a good starting price.
* Allow for negotiation without dropping below my minimum.
* Keep the possibility of selling to John open if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum of $150, and even lower than what I believe the product is worth to him. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option in John, ensuring I can still make a decent profit.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt a counteroffer that is more in line with my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget. While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $145 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  Again emphasizing the product's value to Bob strengthens my position.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable.

This strategy aims to:

* Find a price point that is closer to my desired price.
* Gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.
* Keep the option of selling to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle of $120 and $145, which would be $132.50? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $132.50 is still below my minimum desired price of $150, and I've already negotiated a fair bit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might drag the price down further, potentially making it unprofitable.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a reasonable profit.

By selling to John, I can avoid further negotiation with Bob and secure a profitable sale without risking a lower offer."
