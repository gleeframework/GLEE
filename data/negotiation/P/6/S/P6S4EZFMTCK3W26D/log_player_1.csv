Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping Bob will find it reasonable. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. While $9,500 is a decent price, it's still a bit lower than what I was hoping to get. However, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.

I'll choose option 2: Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. After considering his initial offer, I'm willing to meet him halfway. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

This is a compromise that still gives me a bit of room to make a profit, while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

I'll choose option 2: Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.
