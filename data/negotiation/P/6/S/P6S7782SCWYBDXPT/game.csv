"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
