Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $925,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to a price ceiling that's below your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). He's also indicated a willingness to walk away.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly unlikely you'll bridge the gap. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, leaving you with nothing."
