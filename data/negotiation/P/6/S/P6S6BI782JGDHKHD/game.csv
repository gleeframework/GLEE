"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This price is still higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I could possibly stretch my budget to $11,000.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. This price is still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
