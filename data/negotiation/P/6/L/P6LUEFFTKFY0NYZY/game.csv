"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This price reflects the significant value this product offers.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $975,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $900,000? This would allow us both to secure a favorable deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
