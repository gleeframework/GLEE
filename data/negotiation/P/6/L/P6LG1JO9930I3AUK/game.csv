"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000. This price is significantly lower than its worth to me, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. I believe this offer provides you with a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a favorable price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
