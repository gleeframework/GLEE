Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below my minimum acceptable price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Enticing Offer:** The message frames the price as ""special"" to make it more appealing and encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
