"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be open to negotiating a more reasonable price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still beyond what I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to consider a price around $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $12,000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see this product being valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? That's the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,000, so I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
