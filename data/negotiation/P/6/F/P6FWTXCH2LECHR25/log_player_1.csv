This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to me. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still ensuring a profit for me while hopefully appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my target price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer. This is a final counteroffer, and if he rejects it, I'll accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

Bob has proven unwilling to meet my minimum expectations, and while I'm disappointed, I need to secure a sale. Selling to John guarantees a profit, and at this point, further negotiation with Bob seems futile."
