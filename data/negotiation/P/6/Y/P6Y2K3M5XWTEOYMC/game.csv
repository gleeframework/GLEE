"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
