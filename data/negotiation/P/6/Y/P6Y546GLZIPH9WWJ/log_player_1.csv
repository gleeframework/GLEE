"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $7,500, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a good deal and is fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my ideal price, $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal and allows me to recoup most of my investment.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $6,800. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

This is a tough one!  We've gone through a lot of rounds and Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd love to continue negotiating, I'm concerned we're running out of time.  To ensure I get a fair price, I'm going to go ahead and sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a safe and reasonable choice."
