"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price still gives you a good deal and is fair to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that gives you a great deal and allows me to recoup most of my investment.  Let's close this deal!",8250.0,Alice,5,
