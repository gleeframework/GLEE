"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $22,500, which reflects the true value of this item. What do you think?",22500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,500 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of this product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's the highest I can go, and it's a fair price for the value I'm getting.",10000.0,Bob,6,
