Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential savings you'll get from selling it quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
