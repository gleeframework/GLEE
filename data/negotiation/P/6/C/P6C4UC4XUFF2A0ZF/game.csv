"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and the potential savings you'll get from selling it quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target price.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
