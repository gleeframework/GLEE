"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that represents a significant gain for you. I believe the product's value to you is far greater than the price I'm proposing.  I'm confident you'll recognize this as a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price that's very advantageous for her. While she doesn't state a specific number, her language suggests she's aiming for a price significantly above her $800,000 valuation. 

It's highly likely you can get a better price than $950,000 by rejecting her initial offer and seeing if she'll come down.  Even if she doesn't budge much, John's $1,000,000 offer acts as a maximum price you'll have to pay."
