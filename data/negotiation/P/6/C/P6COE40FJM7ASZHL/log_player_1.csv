Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,200,000, which is your guaranteed sale price with John.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the sure deal with John."
