Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you have a different price in mind, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.
