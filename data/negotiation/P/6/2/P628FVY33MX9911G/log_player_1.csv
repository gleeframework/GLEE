Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for my full value. I'm confident that if Bob rejects, I can still secure a sale with John for the same price.  This negotiation will give Bob a chance to try to get a better price, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to settle for that much less than my minimum. I will counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer. I'm showing flexibility, but I'm not willing to go too much lower than my minimum value. I believe this counteroffer is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see that as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I will counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that is closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm making one final concession, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John and guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though he has moved closer. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. I can guarantee my minimum value with John, and I don't want to risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
