"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,600,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
