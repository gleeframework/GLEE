"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's split the difference and make this happen.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $90, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to get it for $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,6,
