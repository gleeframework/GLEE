"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which is a significant amount but leaves room for negotiation. This is a strong opening position that demonstrates my confidence in the product's value.
* **Target Range:** This price is within Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, making it likely he will consider the offer.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I'm leaving myself room to negotiate downward if necessary.  I'm willing to go lower, but not below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John's offer of $800,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's too low for me to accept immediately.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  I have John's offer as a safety net, so I can afford to be firm in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counter-offering with a price of $900,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I want to gauge Bob's willingness to budge. If he accepts, great. If he rejects, I'll have more information to make a decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Unreasonable Offer:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This shows he's not willing to negotiate fairly.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially get a lower price.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to gamble on a counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower. 

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John is the most sensible option. It guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
