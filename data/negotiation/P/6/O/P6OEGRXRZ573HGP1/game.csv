"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I see the value you place in the product, however, my initial valuation stands.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
