Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  Since Bob values the product at $120,  $170 might be a bit high, but it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $120, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. However, it's also the price I can get from John, so I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is not high enough.  I'll sell the product to John for $150, which is a better deal for me."
