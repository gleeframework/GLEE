Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* Gauge Bob's interest. If he's not interested at $12,000, it's likely he won't be at a higher price.
* Leave room for negotiation. I'm prepared to potentially lower the price, but I'll aim to get as close to my desired $15,000 as possible. 
* Provide a clear starting point for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If not, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000. Selling to John would be a much more profitable option.  

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will proceed to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim to reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price. If Bob isn't willing to negotiate, I'll ultimately sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget to consider, but this product is truly unique and worth a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This price is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. 
* **The message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns, but reiterate the value of the product.  This message is still friendly and shows a willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** My counteroffer shows flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy often helps parties feel like they're getting a fair deal. 
* **Setting a limit:** While $10,500 is below my desired price, it's still a reasonable profit for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the $15,000 I can get from John.  Bob's counteroffer shows he's unwilling to budge further, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on the higher price from John.

**Strategy:**

By choosing to sell to John, I ensure I get the best possible price for my product. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of getting a lower price and the time commitment involved outweigh the potential benefits."
