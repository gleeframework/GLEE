,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? That way, we both come away feeling satisfied with the deal.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,750. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $14,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,100.  That's a fair price, and it gets this deal closed. What do you say?",14100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14,100, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,200. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",14200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close to a deal!  I'm willing to go up to $14,150. That's a fair price, and it gets this deal closed.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",14150.0,Bob,10,
