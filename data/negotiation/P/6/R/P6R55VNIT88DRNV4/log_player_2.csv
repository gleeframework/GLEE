"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you! I'm offering you a unique product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target, but it's still a bit too high.  Bob should keep negotiating to see if he can get a lower price. Buying from John for $15,000 is a last resort, and there's still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,750? That way, we both come away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,750. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,250. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,250 is closer to Bob's target price, but it's still more than what he wants to pay.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and there's still room for a better deal. Buying from John is still a last resort, and Bob should keep trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  How about $14,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above Bob's target price. There are only a few rounds left, so Bob needs to be strategic.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $14,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,100.  That's a fair price, and it gets this deal closed. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $14,100, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,200. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round before having to buy from John.  While Alice's offer is close to Bob's target, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  Bob should push for a lower price. He has nothing to lose by rejecting this offer and trying to get one more round of negotiation.  If Alice won't budge, Bob can buy from John as a last resort."

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're so close to a deal!  I'm willing to go up to $14,150. That's a fair price, and it gets this deal closed.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 14150}
