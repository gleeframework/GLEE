"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. Let's try to bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
