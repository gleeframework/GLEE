"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price of $9,500. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase from John for $10,000, which is within your budget.**  While this is the highest price you're willing to pay, it's still better than paying more to Alice."
