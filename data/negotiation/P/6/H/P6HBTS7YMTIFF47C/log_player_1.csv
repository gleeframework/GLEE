Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price creates a sense of urgency and makes it seem like Bob is getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing my potential profit.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
