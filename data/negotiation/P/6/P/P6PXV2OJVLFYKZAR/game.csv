"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $8500? I'm really interested in this product and am confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about $9250? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it'll be worth it for you. ",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still interested in the product, but $9250 is a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000?  This feels like a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
