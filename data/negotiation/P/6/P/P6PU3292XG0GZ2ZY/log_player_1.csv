Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This allows me room to negotiate.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating my willingness to negotiate by saying ""open to negotiation"". This encourages Bob to make a counteroffer and keeps the negotiation going.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone (""great product"") to make Bob feel valued and interested. 

This offer strikes a balance between being assertive and being open to compromise. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see where the negotiation goes."
