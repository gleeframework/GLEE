"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit closer to my budget. Given the value we both agree on, I'm willing to offer $650,000. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my financial limits.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $675,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
