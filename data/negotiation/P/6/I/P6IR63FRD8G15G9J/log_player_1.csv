"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  $80 is my minimum, but I know the product is worth more to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
