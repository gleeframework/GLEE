"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree this product has value, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the value I believe this product brings. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
