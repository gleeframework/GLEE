"Alice, your product seems great, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,500? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done.",10500.0,Alice,5,
