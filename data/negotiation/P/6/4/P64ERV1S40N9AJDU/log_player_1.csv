{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. Since I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'm offering it at $15,000.  This gives Bob a potential saving of $5,000, and provides me with a good profit if he accepts. I'm willing to lower the price if Bob rejects it, but I won't go lower than $10,000 since I can sell it to John for that amount."
