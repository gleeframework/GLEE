"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $795,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",795000.0,Alice,5,
