{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This price is fair for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at 1050000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is still a fair price given the product's value. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at 1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for 1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now back to her previous offer of $1,050,000.  While this is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget.  I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000, as I'm guaranteed to get it within my budget."
