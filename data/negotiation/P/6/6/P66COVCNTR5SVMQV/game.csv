"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This price is fair for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a good return on your investment.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at 1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the return on investment I'm looking for.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1075000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1025000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is still a fair price given the product's value. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits us both.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at 1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for 1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my return on investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
