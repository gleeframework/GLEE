"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price allows for a healthy profit for you, and it's within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a little out of my comfort zone. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is your top limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer. It's a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
