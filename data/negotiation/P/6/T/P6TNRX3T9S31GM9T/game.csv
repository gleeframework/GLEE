"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $90. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",90.0,Alice,5,
