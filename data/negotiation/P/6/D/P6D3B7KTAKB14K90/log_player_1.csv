Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below our guaranteed selling point ($1,300,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits, even if they value it less than we do. 

By starting high and highlighting the product's value, we increase the chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value of $800,000, while still remaining below our guaranteed selling point."
