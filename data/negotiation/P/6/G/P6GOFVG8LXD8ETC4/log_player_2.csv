"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure to reflect the true value of the product.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000?  This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

$950,000 is a good price, saving you $250,000 compared to buying from John."
