"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value I've placed on the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $14,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $16,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $15,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
