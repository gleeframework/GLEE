Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $14,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $16,000 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise that's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $15,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and there's a good chance I'll be able to get a higher price if I reject and continue negotiating."
