Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I believe this is a good starting point considering I have a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but still below what I'm hoping to get. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm closer to my minimum price with Bob's offer, I've already made significant concessions and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my desired profit."
