"Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While your offer is tempting, I'm confident the value this product offers justifies a slightly higher price. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is still a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's keep this negotiation productive and find a win-win solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and it's a fair price considering the value we're both seeking. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I value your offer, $875,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000,  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",890000.0,Alice,5,
