"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while establishing the product's significance. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level and provides insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced into a deal below your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your aspirational target. You have room to negotiate and explore if he's willing to go higher. Additionally, accepting his first offer might make him think you'd have gone even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, the value of this product is significant, and I believe my initial asking price is justified. Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, but not drastically. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Targeting the Middle:** The new offer aims for a price point that's more advantageous than Bob's initial proposal, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation active and encourage Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It exceeds your minimum acceptable price, securing you a profit.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids potential delays and uncertainties of further negotiation. The longer the negotiation continues, the higher the risk of the deal falling through.
* **Solid Gain:** While you could push for a higher price, the difference is relatively small compared to the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting a good offer now guarantees a positive outcome."
