"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within your budget.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a good deal for you.  This price is within your budget and saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much lower price, so accepting the offer is the best option."
