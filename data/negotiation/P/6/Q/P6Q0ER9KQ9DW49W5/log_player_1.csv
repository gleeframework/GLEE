Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000, so I don't have to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than John's offer, I can still try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my floor price and gives us both a bit of room to negotiate."
