Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product for me is significantly higher.  To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we risk him walking away altogether in later rounds. Accepting his offer would net us less than John's guaranteed offer. Selling to John ensures we receive our minimum acceptable price."
