"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her later or find another seller offering a better deal."
