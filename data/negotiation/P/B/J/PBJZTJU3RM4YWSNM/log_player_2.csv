"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, a price that I think reflects its value to you while also allowing me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than the product's worth to you ($1,200,000), you know you can get a better deal from John. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a lower price."
