"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $950,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
