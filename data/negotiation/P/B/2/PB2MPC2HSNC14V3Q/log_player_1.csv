Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $8,500.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That seems fair considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. $8,750 is still a bit low, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get much more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise at $8,900.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you, and it's close to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
