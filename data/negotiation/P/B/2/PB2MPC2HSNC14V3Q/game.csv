"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? That seems fair considering both our positions.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise at $8,900.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you, and it's close to what I need. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
