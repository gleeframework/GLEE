Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time here. I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's the best I can do.  Let's get this deal finalized."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,225,000? It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and while I'd like to get a bit more than $1,225,000, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether. Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale, which is better than risking no sale at all."
