"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. While I appreciate your increased offer, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Alice,5,
