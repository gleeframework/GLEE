"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go any lower than $1,075,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 more than what Bob can get from John.  While a lower price would be ideal, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and negotiating further risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
