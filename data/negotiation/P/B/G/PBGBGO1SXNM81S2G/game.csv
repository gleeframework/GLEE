"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go any lower than $1,075,000. I'm confident that the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
