Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. By coming down slightly, we signal flexibility but hold firm on a price significantly above John's offer.  This keeps the pressure on Bob while aiming for a strong final agreement."
