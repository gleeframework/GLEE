"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to move closer to your target. How about we meet at $850,000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, as well as my own minimum price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle at $875,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait with Alice.  She seems unwilling to budge much lower than $850,000. You have a guaranteed option with John for $800,000, and continuing to negotiate with Alice has a significant risk of not resulting in a better deal."
