Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  While I'd like to have earned more, securing this deal is a good outcome."
