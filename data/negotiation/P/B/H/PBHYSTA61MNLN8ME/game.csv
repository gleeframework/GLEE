"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a revised price. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you meet me somewhere around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
