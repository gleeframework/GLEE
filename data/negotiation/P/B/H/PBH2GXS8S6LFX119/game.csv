"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to you is significant, and $12,000 is below its true worth.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $13,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm still considering buying from John for $15,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to myself as well. $12,500 is my final offer - it's a compromise that recognizes the product's value to both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,250. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Bob,6,
