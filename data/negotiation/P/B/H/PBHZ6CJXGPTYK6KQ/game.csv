"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on this.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still holding firm at $120. This is my bottom line, and it's a fair price for a product worth that much to you. Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
