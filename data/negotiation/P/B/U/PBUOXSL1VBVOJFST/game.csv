"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $5,000.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, so let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that.  I could go up to $6,500.  That's a big jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about making a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad to see you're willing to negotiate.  While I appreciate the increase, $6,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? That's a fair compromise, and it will allow us both to walk away happy.",8000.0,Alice,5,
