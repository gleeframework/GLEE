"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is tempting, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
