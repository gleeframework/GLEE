Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $110, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial price gives me a cushion to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob counteroffers.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price of $120, which is crucial for ensuring I profit.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message can encourage Bob to engage and potentially be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, $90 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $90 is tempting, I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a good profit:** $100 is still a good price for me, as it's well above my minimum of $120. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $100. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $95 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a high chance that if I reject Bob's offer and counter, we could go back and forth for a long time without reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:**  Selling to John at $120 guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to take the safe and secure option with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
