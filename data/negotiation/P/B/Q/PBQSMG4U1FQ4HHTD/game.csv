"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to spend. How about $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value and uniqueness of the product, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value and rarity, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Given my budget constraints, I believe $1000000 is the maximum I could reasonably consider for this product. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
