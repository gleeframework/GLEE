"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. It gives us room to negotiate down if necessary, and allows us to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer so early in the negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation. It also signals my seriousness about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,800 is still below my desired value. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's perceived value, potentially making it more appealing to him.  I'm hoping this offer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum desired price.  I'm confident I can close the deal with John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable value for the product."
