,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130. How about we try $132.50? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $132.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can land on $131. That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",131.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132.50 and $131. How about we try $131.25? It's a small concession, but it's still a decent profit for me.",131.25,Alice,7,
