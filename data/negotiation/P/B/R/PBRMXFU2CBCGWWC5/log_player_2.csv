(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $390,000 less than John's price ($1,500,000 - $1,110,000).
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has moved closer to your desired price range. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price, but there's a risk Alice could become less flexible, and you're already getting a very good deal."
