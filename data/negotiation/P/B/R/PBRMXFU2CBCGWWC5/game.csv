"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000, which would be $1,125,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $1,100,000 and call it a deal?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and my previous offer of $1,125,000, which would be $1,112,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up the offer. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
