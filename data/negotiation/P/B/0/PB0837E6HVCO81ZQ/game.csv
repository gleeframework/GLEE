"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1750000. This reflects the value I believe this product holds, while also being a fair price for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
