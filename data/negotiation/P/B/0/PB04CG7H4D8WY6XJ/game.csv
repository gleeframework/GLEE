"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but it's more in line with my financial constraints. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This price still offers you a great value and allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This price is a fair reflection of its value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
