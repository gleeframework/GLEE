{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, I can likely get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  This puts pressure on Alice to come down in price and sets the stage for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get her down to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 97}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price.  It's a compromise that could lead to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price of $95.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or I'll run out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
