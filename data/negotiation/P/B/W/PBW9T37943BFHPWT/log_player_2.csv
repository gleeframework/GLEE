Alice seems firm on her price and unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer. While there might be a small chance to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, the potential savings are unlikely to outweigh the risk of her walking away. Buying from John guarantees the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay, saving you at least $250,000 and potentially more if you could have negotiated Alice down further."
