"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your response.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're very close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low, considering the product's value to me. I can offer you a slight increase to $1,050,000, but I'm afraid that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final counteroffer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
