"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is very attractive ($750,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000).**
* **However, there's potential to save even more.**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so you can try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still pushing for a favorable price. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Seeing how Alice responds will give me a better sense of her negotiation flexibility and how far I can push."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still favorable, but there's still room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price than $850,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to continue to push for a lower price.**  You've already established a lower range with your counteroffer, and Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is likely to lead to a better price for you.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer to $700,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer of $850,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below your preferred range.
* **Seeking a middle ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between the two previous offers, potentially leading to a deal in this round.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While I could offer a lower price, I'm balancing the risk of Alice rejecting my offer again with the potential reward of closing the deal at a price that's still favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my ideal price range.** While I would prefer a lower price, the offer of $900,000 is significantly less than my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and still represents a good deal.
* **Continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity.**  With only five rounds left, continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids further risk.** It's important to balance the potential for a slightly better price with the certainty of securing a deal at a favorable price."
