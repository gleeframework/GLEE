{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It's also close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value, which could encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise, and still well below what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $13,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $13,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to counteroffer."
