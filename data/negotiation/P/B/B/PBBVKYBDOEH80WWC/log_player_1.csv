Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Walk-Away Point:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This is useful information, but we want to maximize our profit.
* **Our Safety Net:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000. This gives us a strong negotiating position.
* **Aiming High:**  Starting with an offer slightly below our guaranteed price ($1,350,000) allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as ""fair"" and emphasizes the product's value, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** We get $1,350,000, a great outcome!
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. We have room to negotiate down slightly, knowing our bottom line is $1,500,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** We simply move on to John and secure our guaranteed $1,500,000."
