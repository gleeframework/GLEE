"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $12,500 just yet.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,250 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $12,800? That's a fair compromise, I think.",12800.0,Bob,4,
