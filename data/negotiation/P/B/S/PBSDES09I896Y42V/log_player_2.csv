"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you will make it a worthwhile purchase.  This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a classic negotiation tactic. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting a higher price by mentioning another buyer.  While the product is worth more to you than Alice, you have a better alternative with John.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can:

* **Call her bluff:**  There's a chance she's bluffing about the other buyer to get a better price.
* **Potentially negotiate a better deal:** She might come back with a lower price if she's genuinely interested in selling to you. 

You're in a strong position because you have John as a backup option at $1,500,000."
