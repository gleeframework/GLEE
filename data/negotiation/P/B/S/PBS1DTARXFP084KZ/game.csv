"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still below my acceptable range.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's work together to find a solution.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,750.  This seems like a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
