"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially maximize my profits while giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still below my acceptable range.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal with continued negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,750.  This seems like a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm offering a price that's again halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows continued compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum."
