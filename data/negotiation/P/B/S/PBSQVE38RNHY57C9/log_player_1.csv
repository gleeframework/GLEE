Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum and our initial ask. We will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings to your business is significantly higher. It's a unique opportunity that doesn't come around often. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This represents a significant discount on its true value."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, we still have room to negotiate and Bob's perceived value is significantly higher. We'll counteroffer again, but tread carefully to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now offering a price that is significantly higher than our safety net with John. Continuing to negotiate for incremental gains carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. Accepting $1,050,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids potentially leaving money on the table."
