"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a clear signal that she's starting high and expects to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially bring the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. This is my maximum price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum price. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a more than fair offer considering the potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. While she has moved closer to my price, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to push the price lower. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product for me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I see your commitment to this, but the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle this right now - $14,000, my final offer.  This is a significant price reduction, and I need a decision today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get a lower price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep pushing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. It's a good step in the right direction, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a compromise for me. This is my absolute final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
