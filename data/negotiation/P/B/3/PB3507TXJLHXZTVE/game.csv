"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is significantly lower than I can consider.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
