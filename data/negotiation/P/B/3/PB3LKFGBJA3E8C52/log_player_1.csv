Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm starting the negotiation with a price that leaves room for compromise. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option. This gives me leverage if Bob is unwilling to meet my price. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further, making counteroffers if necessary. However, I'll be mindful of my minimum price of $15,000 and the opportunity cost of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price than his initial valuation, I'm not willing to sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price or sell to John for a higher amount. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I will aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and expressing appreciation for his interest. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting the fairness of the new offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By keeping John in mind as an alternative buyer, I have the option to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he refuses this offer. 
* **Positive tone:** The friendly and positive tone of the message helps build rapport with Bob and encourages him to accept the offer."
