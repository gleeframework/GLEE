Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $14,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a larger portion of the surplus. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There is still a $1,000 difference between my offer and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob space to counteroffer and makes the negotiation feel more collaborative. 
* **The John alternative:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 sets a floor for my negotiations, ensuring I don't accept a price lower than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is willing to pay my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's still a $2,000 difference between Bob's offer and his perceived value of $15,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Learning from Bob's offer:** Bob's counteroffer tells me he's serious about buying, but wants the lowest possible price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my initial $14,000 price, hopefully reaching a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000), showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product, reinforcing the rationale for the price.
* **Creating urgency:** I subtly suggest that this may be my final offer, encouraging Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Staying above minimum:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my budget at $12,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these figures? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further negotiation room:** Bob has consistently offered his minimum price of $12,000, indicating he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation rounds would be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and allows me to move on to other opportunities.

While I'd prefer to earn more, the risk of further negotiation failing and leaving me with no sale outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. Selling to John is the most practical and efficient decision at this point."
