"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this work for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my budget at $12,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these figures?",12000.0,Bob,4,
