{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as I believe you'll find it especially valuable.  I'm asking for $115. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still landing us above our minimum.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  While a higher offer like $119 might net more, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. $115 is a strong starting point to secure a deal."
