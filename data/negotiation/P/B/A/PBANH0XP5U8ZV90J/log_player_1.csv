{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price above the product's value to Bob.  It opens the negotiation and allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob.  I'm ready to adjust my price if needed, but I won't go below my minimum price of $1,000,000.  If Bob doesn't meet my expectations, I can always switch to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000. However, I'm still open to negotiation. I'll send him a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum value. I believe this offer is reasonable and allows for further negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to continue the discussion or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise further. To ensure I receive at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
