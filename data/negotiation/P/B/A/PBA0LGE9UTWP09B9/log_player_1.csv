Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows for potential counter-offers from Bob if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price. 
 
This approach balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
