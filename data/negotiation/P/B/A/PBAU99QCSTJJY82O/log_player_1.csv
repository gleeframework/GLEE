Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price significantly above your baseline.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message implies the product's worth by mentioning ""value and potential."" 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. While you don't mention John directly, the confidence in your offer suggests you have options.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your price if needed, but always keep in mind your $12,000 minimum."
