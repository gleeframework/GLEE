Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its worth, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I value your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within $1,500,000. Could we possibly reach an agreement at $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a strong deal. It provides a significant profit over John's standing offer of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate risks Bob lowering his offer or Alice having to settle for John's lower price as time runs out."
