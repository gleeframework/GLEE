Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it too high ($15,000) risks Bob immediately rejecting it and going with John. Offering it too low ($12,000 or slightly above) leaves potential profit on the table.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential earnings from Bob while ensuring the product is sold at a price acceptable to Alice."
