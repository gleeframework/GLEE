"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He's willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's $500 lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but still wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $9,750 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it's within his budget and a good compromise. It's better than going to John and paying $10,000."
