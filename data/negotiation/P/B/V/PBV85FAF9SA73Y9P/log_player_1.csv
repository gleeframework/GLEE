Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,100,000 still yields a much higher profit than selling to John for $800,000. 

By positioning the offer as exclusive and highlighting the product's value, we increase the chances of Bob accepting a price that benefits us greatly."
