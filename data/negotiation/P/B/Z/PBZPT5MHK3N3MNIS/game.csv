,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105? This would give us both a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $95? I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",95.0,Bob,4,
