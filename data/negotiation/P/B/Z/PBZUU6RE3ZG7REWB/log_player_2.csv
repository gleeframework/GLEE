"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $900,000 for it. This is a special offer considering the high quality and unique features of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is above his budget, and there's room for negotiation.  It's too early to buy from John, as there's a chance to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value,  $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. I am willing to consider $750,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer aligns more closely with your budget while still providing a fair return for our company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $750,000 is within his budget and a good deal considering he's already rejected a lower offer from Alice. Buying from John at $800,000 would be a worse deal."
