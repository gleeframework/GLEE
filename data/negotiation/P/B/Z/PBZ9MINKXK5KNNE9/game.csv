"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to reflect your interest. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final concession. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial asking price, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, Alice, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $12,200 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. To make this a win-win, I'm willing to come down to $12,750. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. If you're able to accept this offer, we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm still not sure if we can agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  This is my final offer.  If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",13000.0,Alice,9,
