Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency (limited-time offer) and implies I might be willing to negotiate slightly. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price anchors the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to my desired price than his initial valuation. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
