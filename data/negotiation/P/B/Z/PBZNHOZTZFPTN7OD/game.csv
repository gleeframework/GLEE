"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we settle on $10,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
