Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still working within a tight budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:** 

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is consistently moving closer to a reasonable offer. $1,325,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with the lower offer from John."
