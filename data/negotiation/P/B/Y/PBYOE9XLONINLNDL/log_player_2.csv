Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $115? I think that's the best we can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at the desired price than risk the negotiation failing with Alice."
