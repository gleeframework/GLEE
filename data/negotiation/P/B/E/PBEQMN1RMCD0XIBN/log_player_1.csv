Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $925,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob allows Alice to start the negotiation significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, making him feel more in control of the deal.
* **Justification for the price:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without explicitly revealing Alice's knowledge of his valuation. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still offering a price Bob might realistically accept."
