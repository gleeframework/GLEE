,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,050,000 remains below the threshold of what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this offer represents a significant compromise and a good opportunity for you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,275,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're nearing a point where we can close this deal. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. I'm prepared to accept $1,225,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
