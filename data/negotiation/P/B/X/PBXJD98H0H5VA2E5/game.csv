"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $7,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal.  What do you say?",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,900? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",7900.0,Bob,6,
