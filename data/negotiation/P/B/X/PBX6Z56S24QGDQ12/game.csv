"Alice, your product is good, but  $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my original asking price. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",850000.0,Alice,5,
