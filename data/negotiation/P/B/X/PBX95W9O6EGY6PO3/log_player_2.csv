"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After considering our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. Even though she's offering a price lower than the product's worth to you, John is selling the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget."
