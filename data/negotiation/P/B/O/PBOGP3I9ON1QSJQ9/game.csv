"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $7,500 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $7,250. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. This is my best offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer you the product for $7,250, but this is the last time I'm willing to budge. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",7250.0,Alice,7,
