(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your ideal.  Rejecting again gives you more room to negotiate further.  While you could buy from John for $10,000, there's still potential to get a better deal with Alice."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is now closer to John's price, but it's still a bit high.  It's worth trying to get a price closer to $10,000.  One more counteroffer could potentially get Alice to accept your price or lead to a final agreement closer to your desired budget."

At this point, it's likely that Alice will either accept your offer, or you will be forced to buy from John."
