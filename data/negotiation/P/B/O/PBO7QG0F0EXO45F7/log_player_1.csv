Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate lower, but I want to see what his initial reaction is."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price. I'm willing to go down to $12,000, but I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for a low price."

I'm dropping my price again, but I'm still above my minimum. I think this is a good compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll be willing to accept John's offer."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and while it's getting closer, I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
