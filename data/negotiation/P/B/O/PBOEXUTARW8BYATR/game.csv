"I appreciate your offer, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. How about we meet at $11800? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",11800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $10750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
