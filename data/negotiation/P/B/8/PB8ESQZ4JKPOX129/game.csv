"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me is $12,000, I'd be willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $13,000. I'll offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this works for you!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $14,000. This is a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $14,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $15,800. This is a good compromise and still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if this works for you!",15800.0,Alice,5,
