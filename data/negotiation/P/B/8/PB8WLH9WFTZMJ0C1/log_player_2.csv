"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my budget of $800,000. I want to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to keep negotiating. Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and hopefully get a price closer to my target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and believe it has a lot of value. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your maximum offer of $800,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $850,000, which is my final counteroffer. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still above my budget.  Although we've made some progress, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product altogether.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
