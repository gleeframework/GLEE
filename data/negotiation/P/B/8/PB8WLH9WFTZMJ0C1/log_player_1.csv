Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
