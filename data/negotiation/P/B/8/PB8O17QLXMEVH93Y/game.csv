"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,550,000?  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
