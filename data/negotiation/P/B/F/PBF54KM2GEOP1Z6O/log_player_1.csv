Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product for less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,500 is still below my minimum, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate.  I can afford to be a little stubborn."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and  I'm not in a hurry to sell to John yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit.  I'm still not quite there though.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
