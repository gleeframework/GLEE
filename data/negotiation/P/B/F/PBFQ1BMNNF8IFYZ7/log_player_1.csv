Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price, I'm starting the negotiation by offering the product to Bob at the maximum price. This strategy has the following advantages:

* **Maximizes potential profit:** It gives me the best chance to get my full desired value for the product.
* **Sets the tone:** By offering a high price upfront, I establish my desired value and create a framework for negotiation.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While I'm aiming for the full price, I'm open to negotiation and understanding that Bob may not accept this initial offer. 

I am aware that Bob values the product at $800,000. By starting high, I create space for counteroffers and ultimately hope to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it is still significantly lower than my desired price and the guaranteed offer from John.  I will reject his offer and proceed with a counteroffer. This strategy ensures that I continue to push for a higher price while maintaining the opportunity to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $1,000,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer of $850,000. 

By moving closer to Bob's price, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids the need to sell to John at a lower price than I would ideally want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is only $100,000 less than what I can get from John.  Given the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my counteroffer, it's more strategic to accept his offer. This ensures a sale and a decent profit, though not my ideal outcome."
