Round 7

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,070,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You've been consistently trying to negotiate a price below $1,060,000. 
* Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but her current offer is still $65,000 above your target.
* You only have 3 rounds left, and the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. 
* It's likely that the remaining rounds will involve small concessions from both sides. 
* Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees a lower price than you're likely to get with Alice, even if you continue negotiating.  

By buying from John, you save time and secure a price that's within your budget."
