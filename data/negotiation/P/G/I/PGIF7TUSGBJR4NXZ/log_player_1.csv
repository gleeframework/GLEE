Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product and understand your desire for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This amount aligns more closely with my valuation of the product, and I believe it offers a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
