Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price might entice Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to John guarantees $120, but there's a slight time advantage to selling to Bob immediately if he accepts."
