"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's make a deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $10,500. This price is still very reasonable given the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting, and it allows us to reach a deal. What do you say?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,200. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise here.",10200.0,Alice,7,
