"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to us and we believe it would be equally valuable to you. To start, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still too high for my goal of saving as much money as possible. I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford at the moment. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $11,500 for the product. This is higher than your offer but lower than our initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my goal, I'm still aiming to save more. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility but $11,500 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering your budget and our product's value, I am willing to accept $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a significant saving compared to her initial offer of $12,000. This is also within my budget and a good compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, I risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the most practical choice at this point."
