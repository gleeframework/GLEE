Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher price.
* **""fair price""**: I'm using framing to make the offer seem reasonable and appealing. 
* **""Let me know your thoughts""**: This invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and signals my willingness to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:** This is just the starting point.  I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses, potentially accepting a counteroffer or making a new one, or choosing to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to try and push for a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. I'll need to be strategic and gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further. If the negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **""Meet you halfway""**: This phrase reinforces the idea of compromise and makes the offer seem more fair.
* **""Great deal for both of us""**:  This emphasizes that a deal at this price would be mutually beneficial.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching for Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer (if any) and decide if it's worth pursuing or if I should switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, as I mentioned earlier. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $1,080,000 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's only $80,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, suggesting that further negotiation may not be productive. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,000,000.  

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures a profit of $80,000 over selling to John. This is a reasonable outcome considering the potential risks of continued negotiation."
