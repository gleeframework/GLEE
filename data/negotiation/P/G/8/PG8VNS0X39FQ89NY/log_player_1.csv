""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates slightly, the final price is likely to be significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000."
