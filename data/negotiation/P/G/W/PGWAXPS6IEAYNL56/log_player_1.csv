Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to stick to my initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and my budget constraints. Thank you for considering my proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly anchored at $12,000 and unlikely to budge significantly. It's not worth our time to continue negotiating for a lower profit when we have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John."
