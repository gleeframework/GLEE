"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $150, but aim to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price point. It's likely you won't get a much lower price, and rejecting it might lead to further back-and-forth negotiations.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price."
