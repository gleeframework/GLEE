"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a 1-year warranty and a free maintenance package. I'll meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
