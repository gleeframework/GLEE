"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle on $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
