"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price further, especially if she's motivated to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good price.  He's aiming to get a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer.  This will likely force Alice to either negotiate or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price, but still leaves room for profit if Bob chooses to resell.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might not be willing to go lower, and Bob could end up paying more. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not a good option, as it's significantly more expensive.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,100,000 is the most prudent choice at this point."
