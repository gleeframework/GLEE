Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $14,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's value of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation and still gets me closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further negotiation or if I should move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but it's closer than his initial value. 
* I'm not willing to settle for $12,500 yet, as I believe I can potentially get closer to my goal of $15,000 through further negotiation.
* Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and explore if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? This still represents a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've countered with $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. 
* **Message:** I reiterate my willingness to negotiate and highlight the value proposition for Bob. By emphasizing that this offer still benefits him, I'm trying to make it more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** We have a deal! I've achieved a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price. While I'd love to get $15,000, it's more likely that further negotiation will result in a lower price or a stalemate.
* Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal that is very close to my goal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll finalize the transaction with Bob and move forward with the sale."
