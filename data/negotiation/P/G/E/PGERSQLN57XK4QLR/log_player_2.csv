"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Bob can get the product for closer to his desired $12,000 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
