Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
