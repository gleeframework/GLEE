Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but is still a great price for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too high (close to $12,000) might discourage Bob, pushing him towards rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $10,000."
