"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $8000 for this product. I understand if this isn't feasible, but I wanted to see if we could reach an agreement within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
