"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price. How does $100 sound? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. 
* This means you'll save $20 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the guaranteed savings by accepting her offer outweigh the potential for a better deal."
