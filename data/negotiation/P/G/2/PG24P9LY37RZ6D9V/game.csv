"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? That's the best I can do.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. $10,000 is closer, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
