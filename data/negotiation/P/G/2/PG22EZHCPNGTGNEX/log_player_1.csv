This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation. It also demonstrates confidence in the product's value, while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, it's still worth exploring if you can get more. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can meet somewhere in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,750,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it, and I think that's a fair price considering the initial offer was $2000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive in his counteroffers. His last offer is below my minimum and I don't think I can get a better offer from him. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
