"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $12,000 to me at most. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is still a good deal considering its value to you is $12,000.",13000.0,Alice,5,
