"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher than his perceived value. This is a strong starting point to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept $900,000, I have time and another buyer who's willing to pay my desired price. I'm going to try to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to see something closer to $950,000. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still above his initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a price that's agreeable to both of us before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $920,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have more rounds and another buyer waiting. I'm going to try to push for a higher price, hoping to get closer to my ideal $1,200,000 without having to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $920,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly, but only to $940,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradual concessions, showing Bob I'm flexible while still aiming for a price close to my desired amount.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will push us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob is not budging much. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not confident we can reach a deal before the deadline.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
