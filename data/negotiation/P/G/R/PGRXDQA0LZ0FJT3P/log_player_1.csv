"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate downwards. It's also a fair starting point as it's lower than Bob's estimated value.  We'll see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you still have room to potentially negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500.  I think that price would be fair for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your original offer and Bob's.  It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that is higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's more than your minimum of $8,000 and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or even losing the sale to John."
