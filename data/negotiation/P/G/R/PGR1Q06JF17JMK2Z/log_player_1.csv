Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm going to reject it and counter-offer.  I'm aiming for at least $10,000 and  believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $10,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not comfortable going any lower.  John's offer is a sure thing at my minimum value, so I'm going to take it and sell to John."
