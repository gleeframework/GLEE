"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me first. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $9,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
