"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without being too specific. This leaves room for Bob to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a collaborative and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than being immediately turned off by an unreasonable starting price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts this initial high price, it's a fantastic outcome.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** Starting high allows me to make concessions strategically throughout the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about obtaining a higher price. However, I need to be cautious as I only have a limited number of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your valuation shows you recognize the value of this product, we're still a bit apart.  I could consider closing the deal at $2,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming well above both my minimum and his initial offer.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's attempt to find a compromise. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Time Constraint:**  While I have a few rounds left, I don't want to drag the negotiation on for too long. This counteroffer pushes for a quicker resolution while still leaving some room for maneuver in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but based on my budget, I can offer $1,950,000 for it. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which indicates he's motivated to buy. However, $1,950,000 is still below my $2,100,000 offer, and significantly below my initial ask. There's a chance I can push him further in the next round. I'm willing to risk losing some profit potential to try and secure a better deal.  I'll need to be more flexible in my next counteroffer, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring you while acknowledging our negotiations. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, only $100,000, and moving closer to the middle ground between our last two offers. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The language ""Let's make this happen"" aims to instill a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this strong offer.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** I'm signaling that this is likely my best offer without explicitly stating it. Bob might be more inclined to accept if he senses limited opportunity for further negotiation. 

This strategy balances:

1. **Profit Maximization:** $2,000,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.
2. **Risk Management:**  As we are in round 5, I need to increase the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,975,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. While I'd prefer to get the full $2,000,000, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity in the $1,950,000 - $1,975,000 range.  

* **Strong Profit:** $1,975,000 is still a very good profit, significantly above my $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down in later rounds.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's always a chance Bob could walk away, leaving me with John's offer as a fallback. Accepting now secures the profit."
