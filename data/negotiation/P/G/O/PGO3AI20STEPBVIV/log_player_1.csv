Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, exceeding your minimum of $800,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high at $925,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""highly valuable"", ""benefits it will bring you"") helps justify the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiation style, you might offer a slightly lower price."
