"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. How about we meet at $11,000? It's still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
