"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it would significantly enhance your endeavors or personal collection. After careful consideration, I am extending to you a special offer to purchase this product at a price of $1,200,000. This offer represents a strategic balance between fairness and maximizing the value I receive for such a valuable asset. I trust that we can come to an agreement that satisfies both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than your maximum budget and buying from John, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to lower her price further."
