"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product is worth a lot to both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
