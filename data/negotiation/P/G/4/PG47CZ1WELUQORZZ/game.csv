"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, considering the value I see in this product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to compromise further and offer $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $925,000, but I need to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to maximize your return, but $975,000 is a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to close this deal.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough to justify the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $975,000, but I need to add a small premium to account for the risks involved. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $990,000. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $965,000, which is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",965000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not convinced that $965,000 is enough to justify the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,9,
