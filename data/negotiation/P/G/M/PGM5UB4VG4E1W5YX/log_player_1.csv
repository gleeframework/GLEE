"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to him to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $15,000 because I want to see if I can get closer to that amount through negotiation. 

**Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I'm not thrilled with Bob's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  This shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll likely propose a price closer to $12,000 or $13,000. This gives me more bargaining power while still being within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This price acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a decent margin.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm framing the price as a ""middle ground,"" which can appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining My Position:**  $11,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely consider a counteroffer slightly lower than $11,500.  However, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, I believe I can still get a higher price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll likely counter with a price slightly below my previous offer of $11,500, perhaps $11,000. I'll continue to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway while staying firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $11,000. This price acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm showing that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appealing to Reason:** By framing the offer as a ""middle ground"" and emphasizing a ""reasonable profit,"" I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's reaction to this offer. If he rejects it again, I'll have to decide if I want to lower my price further or continue with the negotiation. 
* **Preparing for a Potential Counteroffer:**  I'll be ready to counter with a price closer to $10,500 if needed. However, I'll also keep my eye on the potential of selling to John if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $10750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  We're getting closer, but I still have more leverage. I don't want to sell too low.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer of $11,000, perhaps $10,900. I'll keep an eye on the time limit and consider the potential of selling to John if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference at $10,900?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down to $10,900, which is only slightly below my previous offer. 
* **Appealing to Finality:** I'm using language like ""split the difference"" and ""close this deal"" to suggest that this is my final offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be assertive and see if I can secure a deal close to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to make one final counteroffer or accept the risk of selling to John for $15,000. 
* **Considering the John Option:**  The deadline is looming. If Bob's response is unfavorable, I might be forced to sell to John to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
