"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  Based on my understanding of its potential benefits to you, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you won't find this opportunity elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer.  Accepting this offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John."
