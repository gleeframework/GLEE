"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my $80 maximum. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  My counteroffer is far from Alice's asking price, but it shows I'm serious about buying if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $105 is better than her initial offer, but it's still above my $80 maximum. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, which is a good sign. There's room to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it at that price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm holding firm within my budget.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying I'm ""ready to buy,"" I'm indicating that this is a serious offer, and a deal can be made if she accepts. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 leaves some slight room for Alice to counter if she's absolutely unwilling to go that low, but it keeps me safely below my $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $120.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to make sure it's worthwhile. Would you be willing to pay $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is likely bluffing about the other offer to pressure me into accepting a higher price.
* **Above Budget:** $95 is still above my $80 limit.
* **Alternatives Exist:** I can always buy from John for $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to an acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I've been trying to be fair with my offers.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little, but $95 is just too high for me. My final offer is $80.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer.
* **Justification:** I'm acknowledging her position while reiterating my budget constraints.
* **Sense of Urgency (Again):** Highlighting the ""other options"" reminds her that I'm not desperate and have alternatives.
* **At my Limit:**  This offer is at my absolute maximum, sticking to my goal of saving as much as possible."
