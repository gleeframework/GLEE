"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy it at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. To be honest, I have another offer on the table for $120.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need to make sure it's worthwhile. Would you be willing to pay $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I've been trying to be fair with my offers.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little, but $95 is just too high for me. My final offer is $80.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
