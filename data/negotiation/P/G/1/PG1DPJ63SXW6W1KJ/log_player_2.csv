"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $950,000 from Alice. It's worth $800,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to counter and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $900,000? This reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above the value to her ($800,000).  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer again keeps the negotiation going and allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low.  Given the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair price that reflects our shared desire to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a good compromise.  It's lower than your initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a price lower than John's and higher than Alice's minimum.  You're saving money, and the negotiation is coming to a successful conclusion."
