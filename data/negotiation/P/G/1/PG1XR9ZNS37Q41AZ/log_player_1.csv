I'm starting with a price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $17,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum threshold. It's also getting very close to John's offer of $15,000. To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'll accept Bob's offer."
