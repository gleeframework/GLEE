"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I know this product is worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a very attractive offer. If you decide to pass, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I would prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. While Alice is using sales tactics (mentioning another buyer, inflating the product's worth to you), the price is objectively good."
