"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I know this product is worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a very attractive offer. If you decide to pass, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000, but I would prefer to work with you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
