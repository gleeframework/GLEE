"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me first.  However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, $10,500 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $12,250 is closer, it's still a touch more than I'd like to spend.  How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $11,000 is cutting it too close.  My final offer is $11,750.  It's a fair price considering the value you're getting.",11750.0,Alice,5,
