``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  
* **Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum value.**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```
