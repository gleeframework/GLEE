Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to make a counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $1,200,000, it's not worth it to me.  I know the product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to risk a bit more negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for profit. It also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product. Hopefully, this counteroffer is enough to entice Bob without leaving me with a price I'm unhappy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  It's clear that he's not willing to meet me halfway.  While I would prefer to earn more than $1,500,000, I'm not going to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially lose even more.  Selling to John is the best option at this point, as it guarantees a solid profit and prevents me from risking further losses."
