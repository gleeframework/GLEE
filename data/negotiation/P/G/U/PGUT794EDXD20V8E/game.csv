"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,000,000. This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product is worth $800,000 to you, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your focus on finding a fair price.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's aim for a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $950,000, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
