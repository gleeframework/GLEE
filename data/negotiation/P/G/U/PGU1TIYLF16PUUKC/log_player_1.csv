Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his stated value of $80, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to come down to $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price and I'm happy to accept it. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same amount."
