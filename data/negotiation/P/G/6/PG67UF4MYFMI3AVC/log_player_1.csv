While Bob's offer is close to my desired price, I believe I can push for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm sticking to my initial counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price is still a good deal for Bob, and I'm confident he will accept it. If not, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm getting closer to the point where I might consider selling to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I will reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. We are nearing the point where selling to John might be more beneficial, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,375,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway. It's still a good deal for me and a good deal for him, and I'm hoping it will finally lead to an agreement. If not, I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum. While I'd still prefer to get more, I'm not confident that I can push for a higher price with only two rounds remaining. To avoid risking a deal falling through completely, I'll accept John's offer and sell him the product."
