"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way we both get a fair deal.",137.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $137.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",135.0,Bob,4,
