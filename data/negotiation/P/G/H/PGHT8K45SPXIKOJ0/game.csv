"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
