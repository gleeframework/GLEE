"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is under your $150 limit, there's a chance you could get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for a counter-offer or lets you move on to John's $150 price if necessary."
