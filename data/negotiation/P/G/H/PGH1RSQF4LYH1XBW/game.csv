,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a little more than I'm ready to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25? I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",86.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to take another step closer and offer it to you for $88. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $88 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $86.25. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us and a good deal for me.",86.25,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your confidence in your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $86.25. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $89. I think this is the best compromise we can reach. What do you think?",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $89 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $86.25.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.  What do you say?",86.25,Bob,8,
