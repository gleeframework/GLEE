"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for it, given my budget constraints. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $13,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's value while still being a reasonable offer for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $15,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value of the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
