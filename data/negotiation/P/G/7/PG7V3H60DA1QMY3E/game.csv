"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
