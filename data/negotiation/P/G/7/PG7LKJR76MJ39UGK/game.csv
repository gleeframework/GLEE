"Alice, your offer is a little too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited to $1,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to make this deal happen, but I need you to come down to my price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's reach a compromise and finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  My budget truly only allows for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal at my final offer, and we'll both be satisfied.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
