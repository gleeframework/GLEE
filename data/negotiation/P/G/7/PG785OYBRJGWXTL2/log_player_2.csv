"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it available to you today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and $1,000,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement within that range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's within Bob's budget.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially increasing the price again is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price while avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiations."
