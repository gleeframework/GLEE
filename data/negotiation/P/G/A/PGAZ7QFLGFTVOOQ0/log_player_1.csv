Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives me a good starting point, and I believe Bob will likely counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a good deal by staying firm on my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
