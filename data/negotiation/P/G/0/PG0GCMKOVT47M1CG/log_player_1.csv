Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts, as I'm eager to see this benefit your endeavors."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price,  appealing to Bob's potential desire for a unique and valuable asset.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob's ""thoughts"", leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit margin.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, pricing psychology is key. Setting the initial offer too high might discourage Bob completely. This offer attempts to balance ambition with a degree of realism."
