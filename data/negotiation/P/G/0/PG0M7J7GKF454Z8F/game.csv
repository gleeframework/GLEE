"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I can go, and I really think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $108 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $110.  Let's meet in the middle at $110 and call it a deal. It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but no higher. It's the best I can do. Can you consider it?",109.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we compromise and go for $110? It's a small difference, but it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. That's the best I can do. Can you consider it?",108.0,Bob,8,
