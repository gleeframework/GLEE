"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product, but $15000 is more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in purchasing it, but my budget for this product is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go beyond my budget of $8000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
