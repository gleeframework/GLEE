Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's value, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start even higher and be willing to negotiate down closer to $10,000 if Bob seems hesitant."
