"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's too risky to accept without knowing more about the product's true value.  Rejecting allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can pay.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my need to stay within budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,500,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his target.  There are still several rounds left, giving Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,800,000 is still outside of my budget.  I can offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm eager to close this deal, but I can't go any higher."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,700,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While there are more rounds, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget and saves time and potential frustration."
