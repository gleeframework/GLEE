"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can pay.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my need to stay within budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1800000 is still outside of my budget.  I can offer $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm eager to close this deal, but I can't go any higher.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
