"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his target price of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still higher than his target price and too close to John's offer. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on both our parts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's a step closer to his target price, it's still above his budget. Bob should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a strong indication of my interest in purchasing. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on both our parts. I'm also starting to consider other options, so I'd like to resolve this deal soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower. It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at his target price."
