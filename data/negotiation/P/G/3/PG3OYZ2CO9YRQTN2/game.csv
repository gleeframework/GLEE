"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. Can we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While that's closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's some room to negotiate.  How about we settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $800,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,050,000, which is $925,000. That's the lowest I can go.",925000.0,Alice,5,
