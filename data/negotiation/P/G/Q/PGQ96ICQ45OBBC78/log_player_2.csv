{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $900,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation but still showing seriousness in the purchase."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $925,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still within the range where further negotiation is possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 910000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. $910,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, showing he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price. This could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $930,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  It's a good time to close the deal."
