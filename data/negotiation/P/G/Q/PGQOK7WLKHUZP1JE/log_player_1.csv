Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering Bob my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair price considering the value of the product to him, and that it's also a better option than going to John and getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  John is offering my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale.  I'll sell to John."
