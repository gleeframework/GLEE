``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price from him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250.
