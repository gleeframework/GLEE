Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a middle ground.  I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?

Round 6

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, $82.50 is simply too low.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I need to be closer to my desired price. Let's keep working towards a mutually agreeable solution."

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm running out of time and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a deal that's good for me.  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is more in line with what I need."
