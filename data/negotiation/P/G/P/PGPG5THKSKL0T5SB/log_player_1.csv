Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but ultimately, I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get a better price than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on my goal of getting at least $115. I'm confident that this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but it's still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of $112. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than my minimum, and I'm getting closer to my goal.  The risk of further negotiation is that Bob might walk away entirely, or I might have to drop the price even further, so I'm going to take this offer."
