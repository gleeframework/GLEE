"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
 I will reject Bob's offer for $1,100,000. This price is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $1,125,000.

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,075,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm not comfortable going lower. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is too high.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
