"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1250000. This represents a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fantastic deal for you. Consider the potential profit you could realize. I'm confident you won't regret this acquisition.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is $1,250,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
