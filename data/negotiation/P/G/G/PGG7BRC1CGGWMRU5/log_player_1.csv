"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. However, there's still room for negotiation, and I have time.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $17,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $14,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting close! I value your interest and to show my commitment I can come down to $15,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford.  Could you do $14,500 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a close call! Bob is very close to my minimum, and I need to decide if squeezing him further is worth the risk of losing the deal. John offers a guaranteed $15,000. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could potentially get a little more from Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Selling to John guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
