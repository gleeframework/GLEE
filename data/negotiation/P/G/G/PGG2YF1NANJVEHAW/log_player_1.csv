Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.99. I think you'll find this to be a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119.99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $120, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The "".99"" at the end of the price is a common psychological tactic to make the price seem more attractive.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
