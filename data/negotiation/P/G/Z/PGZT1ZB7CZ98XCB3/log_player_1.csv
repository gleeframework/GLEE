"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with the highest possible price is a common negotiation tactic. While it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, it:

* **Establishes a strong position:** It shows you value the product highly.
* **Provides room for negotiation:**  It allows you to gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest.
* **Gathers information:** Bob's reaction to this initial price will give you insight into his willingness to pay.

Even though you have John as a backup, it's always best to aim high initially and try to secure the best possible deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the full asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is quite good, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and you're holding a valuable alternative with John. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're serious about a higher price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value this product brings is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $980,000. This is a small concession on my end, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By lowering the price to $980,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is relatively small, emphasizing the product's high value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  You haven't drastically dropped your price, showing Bob that you're serious about getting a price close to your initial offer.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to propose a higher price, potentially reaching a compromise above his initial $950,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stay within my budget. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still too far from your $1,000,000 minimum.  It's time to:

* **Signal Firmness:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob you're willing to walk away if he doesn't significantly increase his price.
* **Maintain John as Leverage:**  You have a strong alternative with John, giving you the power to walk away from negotiations with Bob if needed.

You'll need to make a smaller concession in the next round, but this rejection keeps the pressure on Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $970,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 970000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Concession:** Dropping to $970,000 is a significant move, designed to entice Bob while still staying above his previous offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer introduces a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Offer:** Stating this is your final offer adds weight to your position. This is a calculated risk, but it could push Bob to accept or counter with a more serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter your latest offer with a proposal of $965,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond $965,000. You've negotiated skillfully and reached a strong point, but it's time to recognize that continuing is unlikely to bridge the remaining gap. 

You have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, which meets your minimum requirement.  Accepting John's offer ensures you get your desired value without the risk of further haggling and potentially losing both deals."
