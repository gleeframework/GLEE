# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above my budget of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. I'm offering a price that's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for some potential compromise. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my budget, I still want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'm going to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to reach a price that's within my budget, but also one that Alice is comfortable with. This offer is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. That's a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still reflecting the product's value. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is just slightly above my budget of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to pay $8,000, it's within a reasonable range. Considering we've already had a few rounds of negotiation, it's likely that Alice won't come down much further. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
