Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a great deal for Alice if he accepts outright. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $10,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting any deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer.
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a solid backup plan with John at $8,000, so there's less pressure to lowball the price to Bob."
