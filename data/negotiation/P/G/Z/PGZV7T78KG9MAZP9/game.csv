,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9300.0,Bob,6,
