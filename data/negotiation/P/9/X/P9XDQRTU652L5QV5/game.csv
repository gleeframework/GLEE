"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
