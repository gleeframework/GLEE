Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is unwilling to budge below her valuation of the product. It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further unsuccessful negotiation."
