Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Reservation Price:** Your lowest acceptable price is $1,000,000 (from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA since you have a strong fallback option (John). However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **Strong Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a significant portion of the value for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived worth.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, making him feel more involved in the process. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive opening might be preferable.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, be prepared to potentially come down a bit."
