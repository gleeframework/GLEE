"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $11,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price, as long as it doesn't risk losing the product to John."
