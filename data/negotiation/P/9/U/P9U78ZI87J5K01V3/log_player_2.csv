{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left, and Alice's offer is close to his ideal price. Accepting the offer is the best option at this point.  If Bob rejects the offer, he's likely to end up buying from John at $12,000.  While $11,250 is a bit higher than Bob's last counteroffer, it's still a good deal, and he should close the deal before the time runs out."
