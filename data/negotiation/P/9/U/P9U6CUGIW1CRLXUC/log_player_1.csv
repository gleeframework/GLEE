"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it at this stage. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to achieve a favorable outcome. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a higher price. While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations are getting close, but it's getting risky. I'm not sure if Bob will budge further, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than any offer I've received from Bob so far."
