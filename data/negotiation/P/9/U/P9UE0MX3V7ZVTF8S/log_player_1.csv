I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $13,500."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $13,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  I'm getting closer to his price point, but still hoping to get a bit more."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,800.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John, and the negotiation seems to be stalling. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
