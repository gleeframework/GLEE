"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to her ($80). This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  $95 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also trying to get a good deal.
* **Setting the Tone:** My message is friendly but firm, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, I believe this product offers significant value at $110.  Could we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  $105 is still a bit higher than the product's value to Alice ($80), but it's within my budget and significantly lower than John's price ($120).
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise. Accepting shows good faith in the negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and losing the deal is too high.

This is a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
