"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $1,000,000, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to me and its worth to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Alice,3,
