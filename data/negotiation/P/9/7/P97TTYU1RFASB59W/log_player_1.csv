Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at $1,000,000, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my target of $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
