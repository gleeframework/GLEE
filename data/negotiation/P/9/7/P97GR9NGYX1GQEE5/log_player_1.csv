"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $100 allows for some give-and-take without feeling pressured to sell too low in the early rounds.
* **Friendly Opening:**  The message is casual and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $70 is better than my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with that amount. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.
* **Not a Big Difference:** I have time and can continue negotiating. Selling to John would only bring me $10 more than Bob's offer, so I'm not in a rush to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Offering $85 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  This price is exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the value for Bob, making it more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $78 is just $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Better:**  I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my target price with a little more negotiation.
* **Time is On My Side:**  I have enough rounds left to continue bargaining without feeling pressured to settle for a suboptimal price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $80 is tempting, I believe I can get a slightly better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to a deal.  How about we split the difference at $81?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a common tactic in negotiations, showing a willingness to compromise. It's also psychologically appealing to Bob as he'll feel like he got a ""win"" since his last offer was $78.
* **Small Increase:** By only increasing my offer by $3, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching an agreement while still staying close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message focuses on the mutual benefit of the deal, making it less likely that Bob will reject it simply out of stubbornness."
