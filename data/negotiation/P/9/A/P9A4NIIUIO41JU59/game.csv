"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a great value for you.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering I'm already above what I could get from John.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,300,000 is still a bit below my ideal price, I'm willing to go down to $1,312,500 to show my commitment to this deal.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,312,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
