"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Since you have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. This price is also closer to my maximum budget, giving me a better deal than buying from John.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,175,000, which is still a bit above my target but within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether increases.  At this price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John, so I'll accept Alice's offer."
