"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! It's a rare opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discounted price. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but it needs to be a lot lower to make sense for me.  How about we start at $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,000.  That's a fair offer considering it's a significant discount from your initial asking price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $8,200, which is still a good deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, I've got another offer at $8,000. If you can match that, I'll buy it from you right now.  It's a fair price and saves us both any more back and forth.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell at $8,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,7,
