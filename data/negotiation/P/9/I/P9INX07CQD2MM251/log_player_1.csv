Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,575,000 for the product.

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob is consistently moving upwards. Accepting $1,575,000 guarantees a good profit above my minimum, whereas further negotiation risks him lowering his offers or me having to settle for John's price."
