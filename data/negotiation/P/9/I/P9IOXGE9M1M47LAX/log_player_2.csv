{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming for a price closer to $120. Since Alice's offer is above your maximum, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly closer to your ideal price of $120.  It leaves room for potential compromise while also demonstrating your serious intent to buy the product."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still above your target.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have multiple rounds left. There's a chance you could get a price even closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer, as it matches your maximum price.  You've shown flexibility by lowering your price, and it's unlikely Alice will want to walk away from the deal, especially since she's likely to be losing money at this price."
