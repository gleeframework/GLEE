# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $850,000. It's a significant asset that I believe will be of great value to you. This price reflects its true worth and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $850,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option."
