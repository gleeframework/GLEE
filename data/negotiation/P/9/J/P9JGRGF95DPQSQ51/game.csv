"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can tell this product is valuable.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen.",8500.0,Alice,5,
