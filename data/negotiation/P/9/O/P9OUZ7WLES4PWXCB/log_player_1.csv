I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum price, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a price of $90. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer."
