Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher offer ($120) allows you to potentially secure a larger profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is closer to Bob's valuation, it leaves some space for him to feel like he's getting a slightly better deal if he negotiates you down a little. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so you can afford to be a little bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
