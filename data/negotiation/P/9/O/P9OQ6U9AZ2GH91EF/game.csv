"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. It's still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I'm serious about buying this product, let's see if we can reach a deal.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $137.50 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's try $162.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's compromise at $150.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",150.0,Bob,6,
