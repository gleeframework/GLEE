"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's still very attractive.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. Let's discuss a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant value this product brings to you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
