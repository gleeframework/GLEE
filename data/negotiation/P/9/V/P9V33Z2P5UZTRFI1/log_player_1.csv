"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $162.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 162.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Let's aim for $155. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is only $5 below my initial asking price, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's a good chance I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds, so accepting this offer seems like the best strategy to maximize my profit."
