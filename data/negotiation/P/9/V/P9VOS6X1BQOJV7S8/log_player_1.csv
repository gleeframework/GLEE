Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to get as close to that $10,000 as possible, but I'm prepared to go lower if necessary.  I'll also be keeping an eye on the time spent negotiating and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a good one, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. It's a compromise that's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his offer than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle.  If he rejects this offer again, I'll likely have to take John's offer to avoid getting stuck in a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good price, very close to my desired price. If I reject this offer and make another counteroffer, there is no guarantee that Bob will accept and I risk losing time. Selling to John would mean losing even more money, so accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option."
