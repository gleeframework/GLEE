"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your budget constraints.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $1000000. This price reflects a fair compromise and ensures that we both benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm not able to go any higher.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.  If not, I'll have to look at other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
