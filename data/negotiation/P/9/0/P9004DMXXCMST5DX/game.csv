"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, after careful consideration, I'm afraid I need to prioritize my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and my target price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still need to ensure I meet my minimum selling price.

"I appreciate your last offer, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1675000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at this price. What are your thoughts?",1675000.0,Alice,7,
