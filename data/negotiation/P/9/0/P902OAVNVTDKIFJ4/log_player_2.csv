"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, Alice's offer of $14,000 saves him $1,000. 
* **Rejecting is not optimal:** Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob will have to buy from John for $15,000, which is the maximum he's willing to pay and doesn't save him any money. 
* **Buying from John is the worst option:**  This is the most expensive option and doesn't align with Bob's goal of saving money."
