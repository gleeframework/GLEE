Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal for you as well.
