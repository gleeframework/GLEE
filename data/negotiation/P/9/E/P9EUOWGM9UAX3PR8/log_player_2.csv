"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still higher than what the product is worth to me. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to my target price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or I might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that is still within my budget and saves me $400,000 compared to buying from John."
