"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us, and I believe it will be a good deal for you as well.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
