{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth no more than $100 to me, and Alice's offer is far too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price and closer to my maximum value for the product. I hope this will encourage Alice to negotiate seriously."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to pay more than $100.  I'll reject her offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my limit, but it's getting closer. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate. I'm hoping that with each round, we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

I'm increasing my offer again to $95. This is a fair price, considering Alice has lowered her offer. Hopefully, Alice will recognize that we're close to an agreement and accept my offer."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we're running out of rounds. It's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to come down to my price point.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $100."
