# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $125. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John or finding another seller."
