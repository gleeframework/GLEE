"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This allows room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of reaching a higher final price.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing the offer confidently and emphasizing the product's value helps set a positive tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you signal that you're open to discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you have John as a backup offer, so you can afford to negotiate strategically with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is still a very fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and John's standing offer. It's too early in the negotiation to accept a price this far below your target.  You have room to counter and try to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  This product has significant potential that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** By saying that $1,100,000 is ""considerably below"" what you can accept, you're clearly signaling that your minimum price is higher while leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Briefly mentioning the product's potential reinforces your position without being overly aggressive.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Meeting ""halfway"" at $1,300,000 makes it seem like a fair compromise, even though you're still closer to your desired price point. This sets a strong anchor for the rest of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk he may walk away. It's best to secure the deal now at your minimum to avoid the chance of losing the sale entirely."
