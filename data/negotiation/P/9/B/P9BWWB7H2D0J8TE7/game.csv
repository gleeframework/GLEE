"Alice,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, which is still a very fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  This product has significant potential that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant amount. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
