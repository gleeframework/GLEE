"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $110? Let's see if we can work something out.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can do $135, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is still a bit high for me. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can meet you halfway at $130. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really like the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to have to stick with $125. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already met you halfway and offered $130, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at $130, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm not going to sell it to you for $125, as I need to make a profit. Let's think about it and see if we can come to a better agreement.",130.0,Alice,7,
