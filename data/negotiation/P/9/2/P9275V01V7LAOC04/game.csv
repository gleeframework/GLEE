"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price still leaves room for you to gain value from the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. $8,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a budget. How about $7,800?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",7800.0,Bob,6,
