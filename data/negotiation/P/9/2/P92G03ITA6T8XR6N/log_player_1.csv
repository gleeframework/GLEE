Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language (""fantastic"", ""love"") to create a good impression and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage a response and start the conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

*  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
*  If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a new counteroffer, or go with John's offer of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept it, there's a chance I could get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Potential for better:** It's possible Bob is willing to pay slightly more, especially if he's truly interested in the product.  
* **Risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I'll have to sell to John for the same price. However, there's a chance I could get more by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come up a bit to $85. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but also trying to push for a better price.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reiterating Bob's interest and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to see it as a worthwhile investment. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts to keep the conversation going and gauge his response.

**Next Step:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects this offer, I might reconsider selling to John, as there's a chance I might not be able to get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Can you do that for me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price, and I risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Risk Aversion:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit of $2.50, which is better than selling to John for $80 and risking losing a potential sale. 

**Next Step:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
