"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer.  While $125 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy this product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still only comfortable paying $130.  It's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low. ",130.0,Bob,4,
