"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and quality.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. That's a fair price, considering the value we both agree on. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11200. This is a fair price, considering the value we both agree on.  Let's see if we can find common ground and close this deal.",11200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement soon.",11500.0,Alice,7,
