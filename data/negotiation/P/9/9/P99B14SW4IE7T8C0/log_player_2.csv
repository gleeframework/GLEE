"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $15,000.** You want to save as much money as possible.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Alice's value:**  This makes the offer realistic and shows you're serious about buying.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,200.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your target price:** While still above your preferred $11,200, $11,500 is a significant improvement from previous offers and gets you closer to your goal.
* **Limited time:** You only have 3 rounds left, and Alice is hinting at reaching her minimum price.  There's a risk of further negotiation stalling or leading to a price higher than $11,500.
* **Buying from John is still an option:** However, accepting this offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile deal."
