"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, knowing he values the product at $100.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I want to allow space for negotiation without immediately pushing Bob away. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as positive and highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I can't afford $175. How about we try $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation space:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for a product this good. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm also presenting it as a fair compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. Let me see if I can come up with something closer to what you're asking. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price.
* **John is still a viable option:**  I can always sell to John for $150 if I don't get a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $130 is a bit closer but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about $140? It's a good deal for you and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us, creating a more collaborative tone.
* **Final push:** I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm ready to consider his next counteroffer if necessary."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found out that similar products are being sold for around $125. Would you consider $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150), it's still below it. 
* **Holding firm:** Bob's argument about similar products doesn't necessarily apply to this specific product. I want to emphasize its uniqueness and potentially higher value.
* **John is a safe bet:**  With only a few rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for a lower price, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. I'm still firm on my price, but to show you I'm willing to work with you, I'll come down to $145. This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I think it's fair for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm making a final concession, coming down to $145, which is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. 
* **Creating urgency:** With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept before I lose patience and sell to John."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John and getting nothing more.
* **Potential for future negotiations:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer now, I could potentially negotiate with Bob again in the future if we build a good relationship."
