"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as I believe there is room for a better price than $8,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than my desired price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and believe I can get closer to my desired $9,000 mark with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
