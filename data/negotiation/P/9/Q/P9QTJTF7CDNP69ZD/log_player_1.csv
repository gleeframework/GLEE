{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room, and it also signals that I believe in the value of the product.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this deal work. This reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good price.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my desired price than John's offer.  It's still above my minimum and a fair compromise. I'll accept and close the deal."
