"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my desired selling price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
