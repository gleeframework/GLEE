"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me some of the way.  $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $760,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a one-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will add significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $820,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",820000.0,Alice,5,
