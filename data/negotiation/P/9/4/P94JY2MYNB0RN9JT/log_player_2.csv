"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,000,000. I know it's a valuable item for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth.  Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, which is the absolute maximum you would consider paying. There's no room for negotiation in her offer. You should reject and see if you can get a better deal from John (or even try negotiating with Alice again)."
