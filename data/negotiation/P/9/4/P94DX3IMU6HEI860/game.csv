"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in it, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on that, I might have to go with another option.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
