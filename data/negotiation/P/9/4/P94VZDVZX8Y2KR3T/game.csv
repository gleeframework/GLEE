"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1200000. I'm offering the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $1200000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1200000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that the product is worth every penny. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need to be honest with you, Alice, I'm starting to think about buying the product from John for $800000. Can you really give me a good reason why I should pay $1200000 for this product?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
