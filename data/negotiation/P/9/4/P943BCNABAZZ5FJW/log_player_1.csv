"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers. 

**Note:**  I'm setting myself up to be able to walk away with a deal closer to my minimum value if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While his offer is low, he's still interested and willing to negotiate.  This suggests there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Opportunity to Improve Offer:** I can counter with a more reasonable price that still leaves room for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still allowing for some flexibility, aiming to secure a deal closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still looking to get closer to $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000? This would ensure we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by a large margin. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still have a firm value for the product.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us, emphasizing that this price would be fair to both parties.
* **Leaving Room for Further Discussion:** This counteroffer keeps the door open for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both of us, and it sets up the negotiation for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Room for Compromise:**  I've already moved significantly from my initial price, and further concessions would put me at a significant financial disadvantage.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There are still rounds left, and I believe I can still achieve a better price through continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price that is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further discussion. This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price but also willing to find a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too far below my ideal price.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering to split the difference, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price would be fair for both of us, creating a sense of shared interest and potentially making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Maintaining Room for Negotiation:** While closer to my minimum, this offer still leaves some room for adjustment in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob closer to my desired price while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone. It keeps the negotiation moving forward without putting me at a disadvantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,325,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but no higher. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  Bob is firm on his offer of $1,250,000. This suggests there's limited room for further negotiation.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 6, leaving only four more rounds to reach a deal.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is offering my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, guaranteeing me the best possible outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Given Bob's unwavering stance and the limited remaining rounds, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer and secure a sale at my desired price."
