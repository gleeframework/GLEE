"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still looking to get closer to $1,400,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000? This would ensure we both get a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too far below my ideal price.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,325,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but no higher. Can you consider that price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
