"Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $8000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11000? This allows you to get a good deal while also letting me make a decent profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  how about $9500? It's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
