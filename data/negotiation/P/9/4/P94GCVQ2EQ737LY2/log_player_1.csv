{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer starts with a price that's above my minimum of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and am willing to pay $95 for it. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $95 is significantly higher than John's offer of $80 and is close to my minimum acceptable price. It's best to accept this offer to secure a good profit."
