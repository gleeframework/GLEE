# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This represents a significant discount from its true value, and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's advantageous for your business. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Therefore, rejecting this offer and going with John is the most financially sound decision."
