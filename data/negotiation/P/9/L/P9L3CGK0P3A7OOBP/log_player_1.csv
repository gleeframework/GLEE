"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not unreasonably so. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm emphasizing the value the product has to Bob, which can help him understand the price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, ensuring the negotiation continues.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,700,000 is significantly less than my minimum, I'm aiming for a quick deal. By offering a higher price, I'm hoping to push Bob to consider accepting quickly. If he doesn't, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit. 

**Reasoning:**

I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price and still have the option to sell to John for a higher price if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to make this deal happen. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but it still remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product while also suggesting a ""common ground"" approach,  which implies a win-win scenario for both parties.
* **Open for Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, hoping to nudge Bob towards a more agreeable price. 

**Reasoning:**

While I could potentially go lower, I want to ensure I get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. The $1,550,000 offer provides a realistic target, while still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob is unwilling to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point and  would mean a significant loss of potential profit. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price.  With 6 rounds left, I have ample time to push for a higher offer.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 as a final compromise.  This offer reflects both the value of the product and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This message emphasizes that this is a final offer, suggesting a need for closure and potentially putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I reiterate the idea of a win-win scenario, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** I explicitly ask Bob to finalize the deal, encouraging him to accept.

**Reasoning:**

This offer is just above my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm trying to push for a quick deal in order to minimize the risk of a long negotiation process and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are in Round 6, and Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that the negotiations will drag on and I might not be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Reasoning:**

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all.  The time pressure is increasing, and it's more prudent to lock in the guaranteed offer."
