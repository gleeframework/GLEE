Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a $50,000 buffer between my offer and my minimum acceptable price. This gives me space to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes fairness. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if I'm not satisfied with Bob's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I won't accept anything less than $1,200,000.
* **I have room to negotiate further.** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price. 
* **I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.**  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,450,000 but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The price is above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still in a good position.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly tone and reiterate the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good price that's closer to my ideal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to consider whether to accept his next counteroffer or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I'm always prepared to sell to John for my minimum price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with $1325000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price. This is a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain. 
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer we negotiate, the greater the risk that something could happen to disrupt the deal (e.g., John might withdraw his offer).
* **Potential for future collaboration:**  Accepting this offer might lead to future business opportunities with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  I'll then look into the possibility of future collaborations with Bob."
