"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your position,  $17000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18500? This would be a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for you.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $18500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to go up to $17500.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",17500.0,Bob,4,
