I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I'll take John's offer of $1,000,000 and move on."
