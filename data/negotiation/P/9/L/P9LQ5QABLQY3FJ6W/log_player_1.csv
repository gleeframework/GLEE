{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product.  I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I'm setting a baseline and hoping to get a price closer to my desired $10,000.  However, if Bob counters too low, I can always reject and either counteroffer again or sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to try and push for a better deal. I will use the next round to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  This approach allows me to explore the possibility of a higher price while still keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a middle ground at $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price.

**Strategy:** 

By offering a compromise and highlighting its fairness, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this counteroffer.  This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is a bit closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. I'm not yet willing to accept a price below $9,000. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to push for a better deal. In the next round, I'll counteroffer again, potentially with a slight reduction from my previous offer of $9,000.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still allowing me to sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $8,900, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price.  I'm also expressing confidence in a positive outcome to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

By making a small concession, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price above my minimum, aiming for a final price closer to $9,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or sell to John."
