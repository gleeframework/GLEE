Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking, Bob can still save money by either counter-offering or buying from John."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still closer to his goal of $8,000, and John is still an option if this negotiation fails.   A counteroffer may bring Alice closer to that price."

Bob should buy from John.  Alice is now only willing to go down to $8,900, which is still $900 more than what John is selling it for.  It's not worth the risk of another counteroffer and possible price increase.  It's better to go with John and save the $900."
