"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant value, and I believe a price closer to $850,000 would be more equitable. This allows for some flexibility on my end while still reflecting the true worth of the product. Let's continue this discussion and see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,
