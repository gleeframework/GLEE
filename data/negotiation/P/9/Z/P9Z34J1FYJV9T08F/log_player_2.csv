Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?"", 
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would save me a good deal."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both benefit from the transaction.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not budging significantly on price.  It's unlikely she'll come down to a price near $8,000, so it's best to take the guaranteed deal from John."
