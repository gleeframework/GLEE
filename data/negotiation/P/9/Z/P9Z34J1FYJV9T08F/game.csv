"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would save me a good deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
