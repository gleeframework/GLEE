"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,550,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I place on it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
