Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000.  This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, as I can get this price from John.  

This strategy is based on the following logic:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I want to get the highest price possible, and $1,200,000 is my target. 
* **No risk involved:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John for the same price.

This strategy doesn't guarantee Bob will accept, but it gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while minimizing risk."
