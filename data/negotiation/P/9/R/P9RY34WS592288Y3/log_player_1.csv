"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than my minimum value, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $105. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $98 is close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further.  It's still early in the game, and I want to avoid selling to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $102. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it still ensures I make a profit while staying within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is close to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I've already rejected lower offers from Bob. I'll reject his offer again and see if I can negotiate further. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $100.  Since Bob has consistently rejected my offers, I'm dropping the price to meet his last offer.  This is a strategic move to close the deal, as time is running out and I'm not willing to sell to John yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better price. It's better to sell to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable value, than risk getting a worse price from Bob or having the negotiation stall out entirely."
