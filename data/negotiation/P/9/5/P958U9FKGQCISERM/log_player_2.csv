Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price or go with John for a guaranteed $8,000 price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay under $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than John's offer, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.  Choosing John ensures Bob gets the best possible price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
