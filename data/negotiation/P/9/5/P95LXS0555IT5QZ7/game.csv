"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $9000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal.",8100.0,Alice,5,
