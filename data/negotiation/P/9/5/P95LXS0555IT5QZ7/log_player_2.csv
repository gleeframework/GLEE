"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice since you can get the product for $12,000 from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your preferred range. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice is firm on her price of $8,100. It's a significant saving compared to John's $12,000, making it the most financially advantageous option."
