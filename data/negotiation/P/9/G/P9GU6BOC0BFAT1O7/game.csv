"I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you in the middle at $8,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let's finalize this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $8,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this unique product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
