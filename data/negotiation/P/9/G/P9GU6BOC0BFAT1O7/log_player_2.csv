# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell you an exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can meet you in the middle at $8,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Round 4

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you at $8,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiation and is getting close to his budget limit. While Alice is willing to come down to $8,100, it's still slightly more than Bob is willing to pay.  Given that he can buy the same product from John for $8,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John."
