Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your valuation and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product. I'll counter in the next round to try and negotiate a better price."

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob seems fixed on $1,200,000. I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'll hold firm in the next round to signal I'm serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and while it's not the $1,300,000 I hoped for,  $1,250,000 is a significant profit. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
