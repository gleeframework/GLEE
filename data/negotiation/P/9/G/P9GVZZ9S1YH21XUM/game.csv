"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your valuation and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
