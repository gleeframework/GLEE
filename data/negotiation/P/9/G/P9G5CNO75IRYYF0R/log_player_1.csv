Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows for potential profit above that.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes its value to him at $800,000. He saves $300,000, and I earn $100,000 more than my guaranteed sale. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This language is intended to make the offer more enticing and encourage Bob to act quickly."
