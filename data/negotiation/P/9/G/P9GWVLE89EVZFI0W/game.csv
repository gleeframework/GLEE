"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After careful consideration, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $1,150,000 is closer to what I can do, but I still need to stay under $1,100,000.  Would you consider $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
