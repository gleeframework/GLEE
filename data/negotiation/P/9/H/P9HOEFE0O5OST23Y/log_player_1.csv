Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,750,000. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company.

This reflects the significant value the product offers, and I'm confident it will be a strong asset for your company. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,625,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my ideal price, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer will secure a sale above my minimum and avoid risking further rounds that could lead to a lower offer or even a rejection."
