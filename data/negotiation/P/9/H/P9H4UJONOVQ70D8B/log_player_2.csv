"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both my maximum price and John's offer. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to try and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance she'll accept this low offer, and if not, it leaves room for me to increase my offer in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still higher than my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

I'm increasing my offer, but still aiming for a price below both my maximum and John's offer.  Offering a compromise close to the middle might be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but I'm still willing to push for a slightly better price.  It's worth risking another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could meet you at $12,000, which feels like a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

I'm holding at my target price. It's a fair offer, and Alice might accept it to avoid further negotiation. Even if she rejects it, I have room to go up slightly in the remaining rounds."
