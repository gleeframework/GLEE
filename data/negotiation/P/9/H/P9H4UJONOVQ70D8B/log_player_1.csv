Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  I still have rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my target price of $14,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $12,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I could meet you at $12,000, which feels like a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. It's a good outcome, and I've successfully negotiated a deal that benefits both of us."
