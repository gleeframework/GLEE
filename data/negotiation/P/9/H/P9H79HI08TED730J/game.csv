"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm really interested in the product, and this would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
