"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe you'd find quite valuable. I'm thinking of a price around $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $95 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation of $80.  A counteroffer of $95 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Message:** Bob is being polite but firm in his intent to lower the price.  He's also showing Alice that he's done some research and knows the product's value.
* **Strategic advantage:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have more leverage in subsequent rounds, knowing he's already negotiated closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's price point, but $102 is still above Bob's desired price. 
* **Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. Bob wants to keep the pressure on to get the price lower.
* **Risk:** While buying from John is always an option, it's still preferable to try to close the deal with Alice at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get it for closer to $98.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Close:** Bob is keeping his counteroffer close to Alice's previous offer ($102), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** Bob is emphasizing a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice, making her aware that Bob is serious about getting a better price."
