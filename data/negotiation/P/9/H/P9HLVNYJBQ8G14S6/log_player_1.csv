Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there at $9,800.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to feel like I might not get a better deal. I've been through five rounds, and I'm not sure how much longer I want to play this game.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer."
