# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if a lower price is achievable before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $800,000.

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm not desperate, so I'm not willing to give in yet. It's worth pushing for a bit more before considering buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I can still push for a lower price and see if Alice will budge further. If she doesn't, I'm still within my budget to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
