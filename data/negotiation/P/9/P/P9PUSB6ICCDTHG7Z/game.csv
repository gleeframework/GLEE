"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
