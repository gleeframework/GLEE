"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11500.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  and propose $12500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $12500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to find a price a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement this time.",12000.0,Bob,6,
