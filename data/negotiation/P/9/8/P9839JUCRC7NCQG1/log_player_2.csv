"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $12,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also reflects your willingness to buy the product while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price. You can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

This counteroffer is a compromise,  higher than your initial offer but still below Alice's last offer. It shows your willingness to meet halfway while still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price, or consider buying from John if it seems like further negotiations won't be fruitful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

This offer is a good middle ground. It's closer to Alice's latest offer but still below your ideal price. It shows a willingness to compromise while remaining firm on your commitment to saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to your maximum, but you can get it from John for $8,000. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice at this point. You're better off securing the product from John and saving the money."
