"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential of the product, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This price is still below the product's worth to me but allows for a reasonable margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
