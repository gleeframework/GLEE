Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is lower, starting with an offer closer to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price makes it seem less arbitrary. Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" implies it might be worth more elsewhere.
* **Leaving an Out:**  We don't want to scare Bob off completely. By framing it as a ""chance"" before a public listing, it suggests the price could go higher later. 

**Goal:** This offer aims to maximize profit if Bob accepts, but still guarantees a sale to John at your minimum price if he rejects."
