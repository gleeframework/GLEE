"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is too low for me.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $160?  That's a significant discount from my initial asking price.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
