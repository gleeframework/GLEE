"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with him. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth this investment. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I believe I can push for a higher price with Bob, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for us. I'm willing to go down to $875,000.  It's a compromise, but I believe this price reflects the value of the product. Let's settle on this price and close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $875,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can negotiate a slightly higher price, especially considering we're nearing the end of our allotted rounds. Selling to John is still a viable option, but I'm going to see if I can get a bit closer to my target with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $850,000. This is my absolute lowest price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value the product can bring to you. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, and I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a serious offer and close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's clear we're not going to agree on a price that satisfies both of us. John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's final offer, and it's important for me to maximize my earnings. I've done my best to negotiate with Bob, but it's time to move on."
