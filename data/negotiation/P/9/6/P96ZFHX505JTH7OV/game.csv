"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let's try to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
