"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
