"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $110. You are willing to pay up to $120, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
