"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still represents a great deal for you, given the value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I'm still aiming to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $1,025,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
