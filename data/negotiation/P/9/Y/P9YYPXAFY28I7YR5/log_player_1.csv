Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is technically impossible *unless* you can convince Bob the product is worth more to him.

**The Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you need to focus on framing the product's value to Bob. This could involve:

* **Highlighting Unique Benefits:**  Does the product offer Bob something no one else can provide? Emphasize these points.
* **Long-Term Value:**  Will the product save or earn Bob money in the long run? Quantify these potential gains. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Can you subtly imply that John's offer might not be available forever?

**The Offer**

Given the challenge, you need to aim high while leaving room for negotiation that might convince Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this unique product. It presents a significant opportunity for [mention Bob's business/situation].  I'm confident it's worth far more than its initial cost in the right hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further to find a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** Expresses confidence in the product's value.
* **Value-Focused:**  Ties the product directly to Bob's needs.
* **High but Negotiable Price:**  Starts above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation if your value proposition resonates.
* **Open to Discussion:** Shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage.

**Important Note:** Even with a strong strategy, securing a deal with Bob is not guaranteed. Your willingness to walk away and accept John's offer is your biggest leverage."
