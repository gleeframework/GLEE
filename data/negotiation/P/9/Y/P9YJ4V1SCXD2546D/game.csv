"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my budget is firm, and I can't go any higher than $7,800. This is my final offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you've made a final offer, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to make it worth my while. I'll offer the product to you for $9,200. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me in the middle.",9200.0,Alice,7,
