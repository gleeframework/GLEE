"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a good chance he can get closer to his target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to stay within his budget and still save as much as possible. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is a good starting point for further negotiation. This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price but leaves room for Alice to make a compromise without feeling pressured to accept a significantly lower offer right away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is only $80,000 more than Bob's ideal price from John. This is a relatively small difference, and Bob is likely to save more time and effort by accepting the offer now rather than risking a further rejection and potentially having to pay even more later.  It's also worth noting that there's no guarantee Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round, and there's always the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again."
