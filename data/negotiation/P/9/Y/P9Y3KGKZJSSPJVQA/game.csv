"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects some movement on my side while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial position. However,  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me to consider. I could potentially make this work for $1,200,000. This offer reflects the serious interest I have in the product while acknowledging my budgetary constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a final offer of $1,550,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
