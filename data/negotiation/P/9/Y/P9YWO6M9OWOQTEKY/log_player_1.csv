``` 

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,125,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away. He's shown willingness to move, but there's no guarantee he'll go much higher. Accepting now secures a strong profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner means you have the capital available for other opportunities.

While there's a chance you could squeeze out a bit more from Bob, the potential gain is likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
