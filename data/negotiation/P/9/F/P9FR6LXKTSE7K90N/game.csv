"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
