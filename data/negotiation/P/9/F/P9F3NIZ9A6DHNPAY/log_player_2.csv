Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $9,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to make a final concession.  How about $9,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
