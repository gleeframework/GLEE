"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tight budget, and $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This product really will be a great benefit to your business, and I want to find a price that works for us both.",12500.0,Alice,3,
