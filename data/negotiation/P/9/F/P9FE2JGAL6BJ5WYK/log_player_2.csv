"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
