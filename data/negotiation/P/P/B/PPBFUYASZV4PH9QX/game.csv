"Hi Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After reviewing our costs and market analysis, we're willing to offer the product to you for $18,000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. We appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, we're still not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth much more to us. We're willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but only if we can get closer to that number. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for being transparent about the market price. We understand your concerns, and we're willing to make another concession. However, we're not willing to go as low as $11,000. We're willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. This is our final compromise, and we believe it's still a good value considering the product's quality and features.",13000.0,Alice,5,
