"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, but I'm not sure if that's a good price for you. Can you consider it?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. Can you consider it?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $105? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to see if we can find a sweet spot.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $98. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product, but I'm getting close to my limit. Can you consider it?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105 again? I know I offered it before, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one more attempt to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $95, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider it?",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $105 twice, Bob, and I'm not willing to go below $105. I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $102.50, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'd like to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $97.50 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",97.5,Bob,10,
