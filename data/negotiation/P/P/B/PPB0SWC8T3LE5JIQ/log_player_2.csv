Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11,000 to be comfortable with the sale. Can you consider that?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500. You have the option to buy from John for $10,000, saving you $500. It's in your best interest to take the guaranteed savings and buy from John."
