You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price, but you have a backup option."

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a price closer to your limit."
