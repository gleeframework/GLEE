(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price, I'd rather sell it to him directly to avoid further negotiation.
