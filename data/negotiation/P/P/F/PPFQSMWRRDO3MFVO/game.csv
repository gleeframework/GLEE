"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $135 for it.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $160? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $145? That would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $152.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product!",152.5,Alice,5,
