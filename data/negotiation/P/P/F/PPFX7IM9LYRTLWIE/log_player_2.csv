"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product really does offer a lot of value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $13,000 is cutting it close to my minimum.  I could go down to $15,500, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $15,500. You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal and save the $500.
