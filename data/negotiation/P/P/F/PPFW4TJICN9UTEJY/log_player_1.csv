This offer starts at a high price, aiming to maximize potential profit.  It also opens the negotiation with a friendly tone and a justification for the price, potentially making Bob more receptive to discussing the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is still a good deal for you considering the product's value and potential. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1550000. This is my final offer, let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and gets me closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of him walking away outweighs the potential gain from another round of negotiations."
