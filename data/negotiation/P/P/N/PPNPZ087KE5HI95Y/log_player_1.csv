{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value while still ensuring I get more than my minimum.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
