"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than our target price and what John offers. We should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We are starting with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's lower bound and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still aiming to get a better deal. We'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We are moving closer to our target price while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. This keeps the conversation going while aiming for a more favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $11,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $11,500?  Let's split the difference and call it a day. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very close to John's price, but we're in a good negotiating position.  We'll push one more time to see if we can get closer to $11,000 before considering John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close! How about we settle at $11,200? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference from Alice's last offer to show flexibility and signal that we're nearing our limit. This keeps the pressure on Alice while aiming for a final agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting very close. $11,200 is tempting, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $11,300?  That's just a little more, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's try to get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm around this price, and it's a good deal at only $300 more than John's offer. Further haggling might not yield significantly better results and could risk losing the deal altogether."
