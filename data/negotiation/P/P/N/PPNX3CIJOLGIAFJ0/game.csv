"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $11,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $11,500?  Let's split the difference and call it a day.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! How about we settle at $11,200? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting very close. $11,200 is tempting, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $11,300?  That's just a little more, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's try to get this done!",11300.0,Alice,7,
