"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000, showing flexibility. It also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than John's offer.
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I want to keep Bob engaged and interested in buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and also less than what John is offering. 
* **I need to negotiate further:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal, so there's time to counter Bob's offer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $12,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my minimum:** I'm moving closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning and compromise:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Keep the negotiation positive:** I'm staying positive and hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept it.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $15,000.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $11,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to come up to $11,500?  Let's split the difference and call it a day."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and move closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting very close. $11,200 is tempting, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $11,300?  That's just a little more, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's try to get this done!"", ""product_price"": 11300}
