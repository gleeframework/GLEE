{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000, reflecting a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since John offers $1,000,000, Alice knows she has a strong fallback position. Starting at $950,000 anchors the negotiation high.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice earns significantly more than his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,"" Alice aims to subtly shift Bob's focus away from a purely numerical comparison to his own valuation.

**Important Note:** This initial offer aims to maximize profit. Depending on Bob's negotiation style and the specifics of the product, Alice might adjust her approach in subsequent exchanges."
