Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still too high. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go down to $100. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. I've already spent time negotiating and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower."
