"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? This is a fair compromise that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? That would make it much easier for me to commit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Would you consider $800,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects the significant value this product offers. If you're truly serious about this deal, I believe this is a price we can both live with.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,5,
