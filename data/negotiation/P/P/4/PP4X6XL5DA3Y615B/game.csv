"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $80. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100.  That's closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  How does that sound?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
