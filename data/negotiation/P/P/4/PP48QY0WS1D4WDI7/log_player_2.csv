"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. There's no need to rush into a deal, especially with John as a backup option. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price.  $4,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget. This counteroffer signals my seriousness in purchasing the product while also pushing Alice to consider a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still possible to get it lower. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I will continue the process to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,500.  Alice is showing willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet her halfway yet. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe a price closer to my initial offer is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to my desired price, but $5,500 is still too high. I'm committed to getting a better deal and believe there's more room for negotiation. It's worth exploring further before resorting to the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only by a small amount to $5,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product and am willing to meet her halfway.  At this point,  I'm getting closer to the price I'm willing to pay.  If Alice rejects this offer, it's a strong indicator that I may need to consider the alternative option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $5,800 is very close to my desired price range. With only three rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. While I could potentially try to get a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a significantly higher price outweighs the potential savings.  It's a good deal within my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."
