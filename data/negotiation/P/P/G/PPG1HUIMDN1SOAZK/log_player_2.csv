{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $14,000
* **Your maximum price:** $15,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, it's still a better deal than buying from John."
