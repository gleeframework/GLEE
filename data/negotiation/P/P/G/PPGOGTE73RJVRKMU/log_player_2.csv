"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation. He can likely secure a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is halfway between our last offers. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. Would you consider $10,900?  This would be a great way to close the deal and ensure you get this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price:** $10,900 is only $400 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $10,500. 
* **Further negotiation may not be worth the risk:**  Bob has already rejected Alice's previous offer and made a counteroffer. Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even make Alice less willing to sell.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Bob knows he can always buy from John for $12,000, so there's no immediate need to push for a lower price.

Accepting Alice's offer at $10,900 saves Bob $1,100 compared to John's price and secures the product without risking further rounds of negotiation."
