"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is halfway between our last offers. Let's finalize the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,750 is a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. Would you consider $10,900?  This would be a great way to close the deal and ensure you get this valuable product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
