"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. It's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I'll see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's a bit lower than my initial offer, which hopefully will make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I think I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and try to push for something closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter with $825,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will recognize this and come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation is getting frustrating. While Bob's offers are getting closer, I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John. At least I'll get my minimum price."
