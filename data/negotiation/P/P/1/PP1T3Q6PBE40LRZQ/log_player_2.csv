"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $1,250,000?  This offer stands as a firm offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $1,250,000. Since you have a standing offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $50,000."
