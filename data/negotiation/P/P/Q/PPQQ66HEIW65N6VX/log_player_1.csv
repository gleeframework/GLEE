"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  However, it's still a price that reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still slightly below my ideal price, I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $860,000 is a good outcome, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
