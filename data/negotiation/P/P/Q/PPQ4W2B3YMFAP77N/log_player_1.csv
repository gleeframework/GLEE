I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob will be interested in this offer, as it's still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,250. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,050

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer will secure a good profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
