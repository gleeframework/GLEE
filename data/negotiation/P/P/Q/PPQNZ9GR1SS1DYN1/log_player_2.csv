"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a great price, but there's always the possibility of getting it even lower. We have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a significant discount. $450,000 is a bold counteroffer, but it's still well within my budget and leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds. I want to see if Alice is willing to compromise, especially since she's the one who initiated the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my initial counteroffer.  While $500,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like, it's a good deal considering my budget and the fact that we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's a smart move to secure the product at a reasonable price rather than risking further rounds that might not yield better results."
