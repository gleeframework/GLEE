Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's still above his initial offer but closer to his stated value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates that I believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. It's time to move on and take the sure thing. John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I can secure a good outcome without risking further negotiation."
