Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and my original offer of $120. How about we try $100? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $100.  It's time to cut bait and secure the $80 price from John."
