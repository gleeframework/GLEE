Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $200 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we settle for $70?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $70 is too low for me to consider.  I could come down to $110, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you do $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob has shown he is unwilling to meet near your minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer than $80, which is far less than John is offering. Cutting your losses and selling to John makes the most financial sense."
