{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a fantastic product at a reasonable price, and I can move it quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** The message focuses on the benefits to both of us, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not going for a ""take it or leave it"" approach.  I want to keep the negotiation open to find a middle ground. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a backup, ensuring I won't settle for a price below my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  $900,000 is less than my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a better deal.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for a price I'm not happy with. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $900,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still offers you a significant discount and a valuable product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,100,000,  moving closer to his offer while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize that the price is justified.
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message highlights the need to compromise to reach a mutually acceptable deal.
* **Keeping the Door Open:** By proposing a price and suggesting finding a way to bridge the gap, I'm encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'm prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response, always keeping my minimum acceptable price and John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which would be $1000000. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $1,000,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my minimum, potentially even above Bob's current offer.
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for a price I'm not satisfied with.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one and go with $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,000,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the fairness of the price, highlighting that it benefits both parties.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on finding a solution that makes everyone happy.
* **Still above minimum:** While this offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for a price I'm not satisfied with.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with Bob's latest offer of $950,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiations are stalled:** We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and the gap between our desired prices is still too significant.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a price that meets my minimum.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** John's offer provides a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum and exceeds Bob's highest offer.  There's no reason to risk further negotiations.

**Conclusion:** 
Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It guarantees a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements, eliminating the uncertainty and potential for further negotiation with Bob."
