"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a fantastic product at a reasonable price, and I can move it quickly.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $900000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still offers you a significant discount and a valuable product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which would be $1000000. Can we discuss this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another compromise.  $1000000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one and go with $1050000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
