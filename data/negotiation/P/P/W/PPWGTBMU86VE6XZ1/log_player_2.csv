Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $900000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1100000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still offers you a significant discount and a valuable product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.

How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one and go with $1050000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.
