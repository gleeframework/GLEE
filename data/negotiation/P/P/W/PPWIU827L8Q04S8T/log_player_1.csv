Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  Remember, you have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John. This gives you leverage, as you don't *need* to accept an offer below that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still above what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate between $9,000 and $10,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're looking for a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price of $10,500, you're showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is halfway between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Above John's Offer:** Importantly, it keeps you above your guaranteed sale price to John, maintaining your leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to your guaranteed $10,000 from John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, especially since he's expressed budget limitations. 
* **Profitable Sale:**  While not your ideal price, $9,800 is still a significant profit over the product's worth to you ($10,000 - $9,800 = $200 profit). 

It's often better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing it by pushing for a slightly higher price."
