Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to him ($15,000). There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. It shows that you are willing to compromise but also that you value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price and is still a significant profit. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer, and it's better to secure the sale now."
