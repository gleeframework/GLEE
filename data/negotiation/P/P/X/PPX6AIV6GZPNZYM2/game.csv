"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $160. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the point where I'd rather buy it from John, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $145. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the higher price. I can do $152, which is a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can make a deal.",152.0,Alice,7,
