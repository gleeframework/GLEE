Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $14,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it for $12,000 from John. It's time to cut negotiations short and go with the sure thing."
