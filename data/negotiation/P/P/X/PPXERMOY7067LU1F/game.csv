"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I have a budget in mind. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
