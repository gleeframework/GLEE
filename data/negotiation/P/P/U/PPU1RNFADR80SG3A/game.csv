"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product!  I've priced it competitively at $18,000.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $10,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I can do $12,000, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a great deal for this product!",12000.0,Alice,5,
