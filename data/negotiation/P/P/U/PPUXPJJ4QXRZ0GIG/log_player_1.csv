Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum value and may be appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is friendly and open to negotiation, leaving the door open for a counteroffer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** There's a risk that Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk, as I can always fall back on John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer provides a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I want to see if I can close the gap between our positions.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll prepare a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try $925,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair price"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value, but I'm demonstrating flexibility to avoid losing the deal entirely. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:** I need to be prepared for the possibility that Bob might reject my counteroffer or propose a lower price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind, but I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob for a slightly higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my desired price of $1,000,000.  It's only a $100,000 difference.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  There's a high probability that we can reach a final agreement at this price.  Further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm running the risk of him changing his mind or finding another seller.  It's safer to secure the deal with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **Market Conditions:** The market might change, and John's offer might not remain valid. 
* **Relationship with Bob:**  Reaching an agreement with Bob now could build a positive relationship for future potential deals."
