"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try $925,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and your need to sell. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
