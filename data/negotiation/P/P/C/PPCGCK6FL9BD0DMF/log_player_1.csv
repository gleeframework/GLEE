Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $950,000. I'm confident it will bring you substantial value."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer that still leaves room for Bob to see value, given his perceived worth of $800,000.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A quicker sale to Bob might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit margin, as opposed to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John. 

This offer balances my desire for maximum profit with the understanding of Bob's potential valuation and my alternative option."
