"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

Bob should reject the offer.  $600,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it for less.  There are 9 more rounds to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000

Bob should continue to negotiate.  $550,000 is a good price, but there are 7 more rounds to get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $525,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 525000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to save even more, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $525,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $575,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should continue to negotiate. He's already gotten the price down significantly, and there are still 5 rounds left. It's worth seeing if he can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $575,000, but I'm still looking to get it a bit lower.  Would you consider $550,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 550000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to save a bit more, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back up to $575,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $570,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $570,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $570,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from the original $800,000, and with only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll get it any lower.  This is a good deal, and he's saved a significant amount of money."
