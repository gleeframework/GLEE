Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 950,000}

This is a bit above the minimum value I'd be willing to accept, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above the minimum value I'd be willing to accept. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still within a reasonable range:

{""product_price"": 920,000}

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 920,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or come close to my desired price. Let's see how he responds!"
