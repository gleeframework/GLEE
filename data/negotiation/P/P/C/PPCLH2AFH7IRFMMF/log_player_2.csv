"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential further negotiation. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in buying the product but also his desire for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is a reasonable price, especially considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $900,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
