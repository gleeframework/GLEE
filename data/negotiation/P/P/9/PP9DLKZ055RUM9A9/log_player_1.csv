"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $85, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $95? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still looking for a bit more discount. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and at this point, I'm comfortable with the offer."
