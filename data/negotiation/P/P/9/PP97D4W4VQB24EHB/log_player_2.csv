"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but $10,000 is still a significant amount above your desired price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's important to keep this option in mind, but you want to try and get a better deal from Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Reasonable compromise:** It suggests you're willing to negotiate but are serious about getting a lower price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, you still have room to lower your price in subsequent rounds.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer assumes that you believe Alice is motivated to sell and is willing to negotiate. The success of this strategy depends on Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You can continue to lower your counteroffer, and Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.** However, you want to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to John. 

**Next Steps:**  You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $9,500 or $9,000. This demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while still keeping your desired price in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** This counteroffer is a good compromise, showing that you're willing to budge but still seeking a price significantly lower than Alice's.
* **Towards Ideal Price:** $9,500 is a good starting point as it's closer to your target price of $9,000 while remaining within your budget.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can always lower it further in subsequent rounds. 

**Important Note:** Keep in mind that Alice might counter with an offer that is still higher than $9,500. It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unacceptable.**  It's your maximum budget, and you don't want to pay more than that.
* **Negotiation seems unlikely.**  Alice is showing a stubbornness in not lowering her price, and it's unlikely she will budge significantly.
* **John offers a fair price.** You've reached the limit of your budget, and buying from John at your maximum price point is a reasonable and sensible choice. 

**Conclusion:** It's better to secure the product at your maximum budget than to continue a potentially fruitless negotiation with Alice."
