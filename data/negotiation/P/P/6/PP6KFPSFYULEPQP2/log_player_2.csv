"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $13,000 is significantly better than John's $15,000 offer, and still within Bob's budget.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential savings. 
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer avoids further rounds of negotiation and secures the product at a good price."
