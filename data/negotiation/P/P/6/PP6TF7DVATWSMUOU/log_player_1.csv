Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  I know it's worth a significant amount to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic premium:**  The $1,250,000 price tag represents a 25% premium over your minimum acceptable price. This accounts for Bob's potential willingness to pay more than its base value to him. 
* **Exclusivity and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an exclusive opportunity, potentially increasing its desirability to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might choose a different starting point."
