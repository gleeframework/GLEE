"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $180 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $140 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be acceptable for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $130. This price is fair considering my budget and your offer. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to accept $130 for the product, as it is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I look forward to proceeding with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally agreed to a price that is within my budget and is a fair compromise given the previous rounds of negotiation.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to try to negotiate further.  Even though John is selling the product for $120, I've invested time and energy in this negotiation with Alice, and it's a good outcome."
