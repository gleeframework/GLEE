# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further. I don't want to risk running out of rounds and getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value."
