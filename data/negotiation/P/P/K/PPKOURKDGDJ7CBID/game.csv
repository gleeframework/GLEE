"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we land at $1,850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $1,850,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
