"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at this price?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet at $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,200.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,200. How about we meet at $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $10,900 is still too low for me. How about we compromise at $11,100? That's a small step up for you and a fair price for me. Let's close this deal.",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,900 and $11,100, which is $11,000. Can we do that?",11000.0,Bob,8,
