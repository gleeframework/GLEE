"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of value. I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. My initial offer is $1400000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1300000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1250000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $1250000 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to compromise one more time. How about $1275000? This feels like a fair price that respects both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
