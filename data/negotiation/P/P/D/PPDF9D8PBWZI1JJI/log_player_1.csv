I'll reject Bob's offer.  $750,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $875,000? "", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $825,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, $825,000 is a decent offer, especially considering John is only willing to pay $800,000.  I'll accept it."
