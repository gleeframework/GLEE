Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Leave Room for Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $175 still yields a profit over both your minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($100).
* **Consider John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $150, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob negotiates. However, remember your bottom line is $150."
