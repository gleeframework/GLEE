"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would work well for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference again â€“ how about $85?  This is a good compromise and I'm willing to make it to finalize the deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
