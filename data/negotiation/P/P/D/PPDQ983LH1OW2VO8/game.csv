"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get a good price while giving you a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price would allow you to make a profit while staying within my financial constraints. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows you to acquire a valuable product at a price significantly below its worth to you, while providing me with a more reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it offers you a fair profit considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
