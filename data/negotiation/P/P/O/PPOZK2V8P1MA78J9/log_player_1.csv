Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a reasonable price that leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to the product's value to Bob, but I also want to be fair and avoid losing the deal.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy with $100, I know it's worth more to him, and I want to see if I can get closer to that value. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $115?  That's still a great deal for you, considering how much this product is worth to you.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. How about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$108 is a good compromise. It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and it shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can't do much better than this, so I'll accept his offer."
