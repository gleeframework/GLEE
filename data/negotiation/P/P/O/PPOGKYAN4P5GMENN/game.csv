"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget.  While I value your interest, the product's inherent worth makes $800,000 too low. Could you consider a counteroffer closer to my initial asking price? I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable figure.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I still believe we can find a solution that works for both of us. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $875,000? This would allow us to close the gap between our offers and move forward with the transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
