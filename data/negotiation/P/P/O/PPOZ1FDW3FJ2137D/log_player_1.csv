Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm aiming high to see where he stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already established a pattern of being willing to negotiate.  If I reject his offer and counter again, I risk him walking away. Since John is offering the same price, it's more efficient to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
