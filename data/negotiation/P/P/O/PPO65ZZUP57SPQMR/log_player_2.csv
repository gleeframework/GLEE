"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000) and leaves room for negotiation. There's a potential to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be open to negotiating a little lower?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($10,000).  It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since Alice stated this is the lowest she can go, which could be a negotiation tactic."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Floor:**  Alice has stated this is her lowest possible price. Pushing further risks a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Price Gap:** The difference between $11,250 (Alice's offer) and $15,000 (John's price) is significant. It's beneficial to secure the product at a lower price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible. 
* **Potential Savings:**  You're still saving a considerable amount compared to buying from John. 

While it's tempting to try for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
