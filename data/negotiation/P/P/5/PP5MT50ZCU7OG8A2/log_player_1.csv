Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" to build a positive rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Flexibility:** By leaving the door open for negotiation (""Let me know what you think.""), I signal that I'm open to finding common ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will evaluate his counteroffer and determine if it's worth further negotiation.  If not, I'll move on to John and secure the $1,500,000 deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. I'm not desperate to sell at a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a more acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will craft a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still acknowledging Bob's interest in the product. 
* **Closely monitor the negotiations:** I'll be prepared to accept an offer if it's sufficiently high, but I'll be ready to move on to John if negotiations with Bob stall or fall below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). 
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message conveys that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains my position that the product is valuable.
* **Building Pressure:**  The phrase ""significant concession"" implies that I'm nearing my limit, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll have a successful negotiation.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John. However, I'll be more cautious about making concessions as I approach my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've made a concession, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** While there is a small gap between Bob's offer and my desired price, it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better result. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting John's offer:** I'll promptly contact John and finalize the deal to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
