"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $125 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that price point be workable for you?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we try $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and I can finalize the purchase right away at that price.",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. How about we try $113? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for my product.",113.0,Alice,7,
