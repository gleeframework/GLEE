Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think this is a fair price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $112.50. How about we try $113? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for my product.

You have three options:
