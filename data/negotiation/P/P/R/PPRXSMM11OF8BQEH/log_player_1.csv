I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 while leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering I don't know Bob's valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is still offering a price significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that Bob will continue to lowball me, and the negotiation could drag on.  John is offering a price that meets my minimum, so it's more efficient to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
