"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $920,000.
