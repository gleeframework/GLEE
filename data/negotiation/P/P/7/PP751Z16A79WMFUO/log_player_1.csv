{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By highlighting the value to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than your initial offer and leaves some room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is too low. While we could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the price we could sell to John. At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob. We're better off securing the sale to John and guaranteeing a profit."
