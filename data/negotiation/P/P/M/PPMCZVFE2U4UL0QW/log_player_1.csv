Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob is not budging from his price, and I've already rejected his offer twice.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. John's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
