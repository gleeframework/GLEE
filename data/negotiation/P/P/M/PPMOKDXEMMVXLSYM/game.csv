"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal considering the market value of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal considering the market value of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $10,500 is my final offer.  If you can't do that, I'll need to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer it to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal considering the market value of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500.  Take it or leave it.",10500.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a good deal considering the market value of $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,9,
