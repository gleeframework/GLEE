"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to you. While I can't divulge all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire this valuable asset for a price significantly below its potential worth.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
