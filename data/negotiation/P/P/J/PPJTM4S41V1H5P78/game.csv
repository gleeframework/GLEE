"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,500. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I think that's fair for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
