I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is clearly holding firm on getting a price above $1.1M.  Continuing to negotiate might save a few thousand dollars, but the risk of the deal falling apart increases.  At $1,125,000, Bob is still getting a significant discount compared to John's offer."
