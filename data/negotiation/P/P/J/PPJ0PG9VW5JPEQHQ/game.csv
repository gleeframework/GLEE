"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree the product has value, I believe  $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
