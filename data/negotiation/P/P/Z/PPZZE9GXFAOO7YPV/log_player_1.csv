{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it is still significantly lower than what you value the product at. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to sell.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum value. You can likely get a better offer from Bob or by selling to John.  Let's see if we can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  However, $10,500 still falls short of my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, it's unlikely he will go higher.  You've already countered several times and it's clear he's not willing to pay your minimum.  Selling to John guarantees you your desired price of $15,000.  It's the most sensible choice at this point."
