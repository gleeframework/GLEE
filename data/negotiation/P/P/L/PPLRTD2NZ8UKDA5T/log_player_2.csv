"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than Bob's budget of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a better offer than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible. It makes sense to reject the offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,250 is still above Bob's ideal price point. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still a chance to negotiate a lower price. The risk of going to John at $10,000 is still lower than accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate the continued effort to compromise, $12,250 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,625. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget. It would be great to finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11625. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm getting close to walking away, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now getting closer to her walk-away price and is no longer budging from her offer. With only 3 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a price point below $12,000 is slim. At this point, Bob should cut his losses and buy from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
