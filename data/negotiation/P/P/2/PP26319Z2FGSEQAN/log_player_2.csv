"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $14,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000, and Alice's offer is $14,000. This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,800. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $13,800, which is very close to your counteroffer of $13,500. 
* Accepting this offer will save you $1,200 compared to buying from John.
* While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially going back to her original price exists."
