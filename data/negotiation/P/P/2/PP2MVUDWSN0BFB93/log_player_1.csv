"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation but aiming for a significant gain. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, especially considering I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still a good profit margin for me and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to consider. I'm also trying to get a deal done quickly, as the longer it takes, the more likely I am to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still with a decent profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $12,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. Hopefully, this is a sweet spot where we can finally reach an agreement."
