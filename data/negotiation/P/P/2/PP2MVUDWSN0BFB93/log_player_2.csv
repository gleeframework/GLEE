"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept this offer right away. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is going to start with his maximum offer, $10,000. This is his ""walk-away"" price, as he can buy from John for that amount. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes Bob's serious intent to negotiate and sets a clear boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He can still try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate but is still firm on his desire to keep the price below his maximum. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $12,000.  This is still a bit more than Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget. He can still try to negotiate further, but there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, potentially leading to a longer negotiation process. At this point, it's a good trade-off: he's saving $2,000 compared to buying from John, and he can try to get an even lower price in future rounds."
