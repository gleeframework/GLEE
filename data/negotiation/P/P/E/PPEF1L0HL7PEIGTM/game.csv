"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $7,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",7750.0,Alice,5,
