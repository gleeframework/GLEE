Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I make a profit. I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still not enough to fully compensate for the value I place on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can achieve a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm dropping the price to $130, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profit margin. This should encourage him to accept the offer, as it's closer to his valuation and still benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price point that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might yield a higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or me wasting time is greater than the potential gains."
