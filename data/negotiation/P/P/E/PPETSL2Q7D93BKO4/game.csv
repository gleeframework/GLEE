"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer $100 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which still leaves some room for negotiation. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase.",110.0,Bob,4,
