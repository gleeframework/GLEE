Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so how about $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $100,  $82.50 is a reasonable price and still above my minimum.  It's better than selling to John for $80, and we're close to the end of our negotiation rounds."
