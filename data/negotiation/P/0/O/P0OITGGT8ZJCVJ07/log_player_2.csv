You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unwilling to budge to your price point, and it's clear that you're unlikely to get the product for less than $90.  At that price, it's more worthwhile to buy from John, who's already selling the product at your acceptable price point."
