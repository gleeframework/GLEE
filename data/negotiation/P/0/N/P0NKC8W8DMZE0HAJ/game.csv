"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer. ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm very close to my limit, but I can stretch to $14,000.  This is the absolute most I can do, and I hope it's enough to reach a deal. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
