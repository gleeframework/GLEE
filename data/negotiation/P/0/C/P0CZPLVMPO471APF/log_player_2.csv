"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price, considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value I see in it, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000**, which is still lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**, and accepting this offer means saving $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation is risky**, as Alice might not budge further. There's a chance she might counter with a price closer to her original offer, which would be worse for Bob. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's current offer and secure the product at a lower price than John's."
