Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that he'll automatically reject it.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exclusive nature and the value it brings, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but not exorbitantly so.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value, justifying the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more in control. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and your assessment of Bob, you could start with a different price point. However, remember your strong position with a guaranteed buyer."
