Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:**  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It might pique Bob's interest:**  A high initial price could make him think the product is truly valuable and incentivize him to counteroffer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000.  This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'd rather continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my initial goal.  I'm not ready to settle for $1,600,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000.  This is a compromise that is a little higher than Bob's last offer and closer to what I want.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to finally accept and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale completely.  I'm going to sell to John."
