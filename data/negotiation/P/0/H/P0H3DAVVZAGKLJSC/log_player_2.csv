(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation ($8,000), which is the maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no room for negotiation to save money with Alice. You can achieve the same price with John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better price from John or use the knowledge of John's price to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
