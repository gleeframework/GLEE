"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial returns you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of potential value for the buyer.
* **Anchoring:** The initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. A high starting point sets a high anchor.
* **Information Gathering:** Bob's response to this initial offer will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay. 

**Important Note:** While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob is strategically sound in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his perceived value ($800,000). It's clear there's room for negotiation. Accepting this offer would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. We'll proceed to the next round and propose a counteroffer that bridges the gap while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is quite low considering the product's potential value, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  We've significantly reduced our price from the initial offer, signaling flexibility. This new price is closer to the midpoint between our initial ask and Bob's first offer. 
* **Still Above Value:**  Even though we're moving closer to Bob's range, this counteroffer remains substantially above his stated value of $800,000, preserving room for further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:**  We have seven rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate, but we've made a substantial move to encourage Bob's engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me but $1,800,000 is still far beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I can't justify going over $700,000.  Would that be workable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. Importantly, his message suggests a possible budget constraint at $700,000. We'll continue negotiating, but we need to carefully consider our next move to maximize our potential profit while being aware of Bob's potential limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to reaching a deal that works for both of us.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns you can expect. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at our absolute minimum price ($1,500,000). By presenting it as our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Transparency and Urgency:**  We've been transparent about having another buyer at this price, creating a sense of urgency and limited opportunity for Bob.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating that his offer undervalues the product, reinforcing the value proposition.

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob Accepts:** We secure our minimum acceptable price.
2. **Bob Rejects/Lowballs:** We proceed with selling to John, knowing we maximized our potential profit in the negotiation with Bob."
