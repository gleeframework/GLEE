"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, however,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify a price that high within my budget. I am willing to offer $1,600,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
