Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still yields a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Confident Language:** The message highlights the product's value and exclusivity, subtly creating a sense of urgency and opportunity for Bob. 

By setting the initial price at $1,100,000, I leave room to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still very favorable for me while exceeding Bob's perceived value."
