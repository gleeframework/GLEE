Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a good deal. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and secures the sale without risking losing Bob and having to sell to John for less."
