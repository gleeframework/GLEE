"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
