"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value to me and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which would be $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",11000.0,Alice,7,
