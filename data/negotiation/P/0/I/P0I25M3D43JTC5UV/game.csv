"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go down to $15000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14500.
