"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,500. This represents a significant step toward your asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could come down slightly to $14,250.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a lower price.",14250.0,Alice,5,
