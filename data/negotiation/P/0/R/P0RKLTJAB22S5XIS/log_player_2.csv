"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  There's room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $13,500. This represents a significant step toward your asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I could come down slightly to $14,250.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's final offer of $14,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and with John offering a price that aligns with Bob's maximum, it's the most financially sound decision."
