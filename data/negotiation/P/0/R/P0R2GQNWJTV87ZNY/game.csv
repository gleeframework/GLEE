"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive price considering its potential return on investment. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
