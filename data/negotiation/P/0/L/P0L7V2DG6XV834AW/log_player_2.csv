"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and sets the stage for negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it will hopefully prompt her to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still too high.  While it's closer to my budget, I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. This is still below her last offer and allows for further negotiation. It's a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, she'll be more willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my target, but it's still $100,000 over my budget. I'm not willing to settle just yet, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,400,000, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to her price but still holding firm to my budget. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while staying within my price range. I hope this will push Alice closer to my desired price point."
