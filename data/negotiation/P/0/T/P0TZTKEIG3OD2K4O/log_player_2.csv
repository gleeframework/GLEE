"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows Bob to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's value to me, and it's the best I can do at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,420,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,420,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though they are getting closer, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price within the remaining rounds.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
