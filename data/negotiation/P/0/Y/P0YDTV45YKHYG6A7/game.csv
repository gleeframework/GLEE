"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $1,250,000 on this deal. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your position. However, given the current market conditions and my financial situation, I believe $1,250,000 might not be feasible. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your needs.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
