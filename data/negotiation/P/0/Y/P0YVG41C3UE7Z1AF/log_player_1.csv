Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $14,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **High Anchor:**  This initial high price sets a reference point for the negotiation. Even if Bob counter-offers, it's likely to be closer to my desired price than if I started lower.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob."
