Round 2

# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

This is a tough decision, but I'm holding out for a better price.  I'm not willing to sell for Bob's initial offer, and I think I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
