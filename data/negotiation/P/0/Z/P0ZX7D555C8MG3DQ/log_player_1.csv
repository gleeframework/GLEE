Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some negotiation space while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'd like to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of getting a lower offer or dragging the negotiation on. John is offering my minimum acceptable value, so it's best to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation."
