"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13500. Is that something you'd be interested in?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $14000? I think that's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your offer, but I still think $14000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about we meet exactly in the middle at $13500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can call it a deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
