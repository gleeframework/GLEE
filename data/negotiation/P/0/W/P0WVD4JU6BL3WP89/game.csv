"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I've already factored in a discount for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $100. It's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $90. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really committed to this deal, Bob. However, I've already gone below my minimum price for you in the previous rounds. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $95. It's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,7,
