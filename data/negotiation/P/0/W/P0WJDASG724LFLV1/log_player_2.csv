"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You can get the product for cheaper from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
