Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:** $10,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, which might make Bob more likely to accept. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still increase the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Is above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is more than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, giving him some incentive to negotiate.

**Remember:**  You can always choose to accept John's offer of $12,000 at any point if you're not satisfied with the progress of the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for you.  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and attempt to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you being upfront. I can come down a bit further to $9,500, but that's my absolute lowest.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:**  By dropping to $9,500, you're showing flexibility while still protecting your profits. 
* **Be firm but polite:** You've stated your absolute lowest price, which might encourage Bob to accept, but also leave room for him to make a final counteroffer if needed.
* **Express a desire to finalize:** This creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle on $9,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, accepting his offer at this point secures a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John at $12,000, which would be less profitable."
