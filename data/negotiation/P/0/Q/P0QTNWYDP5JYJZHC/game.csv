,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, while also ensuring I get a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still not quite there at $1,050,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to $1,020,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can make it work.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about we settle on $1,010,000?  This would be a reasonable compromise and allow us to conclude this deal amicably. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to be satisfied with the outcome.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $1,030,000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm ready to close the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm going to make my final offer of $1,005,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while allowing me to make the purchase.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your determination, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,005,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,015,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
