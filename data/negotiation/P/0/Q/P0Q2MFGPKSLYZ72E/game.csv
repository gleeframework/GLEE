"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I need to make a bit more. How about we compromise at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,000.  Would you consider $9,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my minimum price. How about we try $9,900?",9900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. $9,900 is still a bit higher than my comfort zone. How about $9,800? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000, Bob. I think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. How about we meet at $9,900 and call it a day?",9900.0,Alice,9,
