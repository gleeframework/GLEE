Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $102 is still below my minimum.  It's better to sell to John for $120 and ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price."
