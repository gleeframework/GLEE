"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering your potential profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows you to make a significant profit.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
