# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows you to make a significant profit.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us.
