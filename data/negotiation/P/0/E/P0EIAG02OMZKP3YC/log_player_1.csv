Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal's benefit for Bob to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in conversation.

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation and ensuring Bob feels he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering your potential profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum acceptable value.  I need to hold out for a better price.  There's still room for negotiation and I can use the counteroffer to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows you to make a significant profit.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the potential profit for Bob, appealing to his self-interest.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing a ""fair"" price for both parties, making the offer more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position. It creates room for further discussion and potentially leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit.  If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached my minimum acceptable value with his offer of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
