Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The high initial price helps you gauge Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, it indicates he's interested but wants a lower price, opening up the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, you have space to come down in price if Bob counters. This makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal through negotiation, increasing the chance of a successful sale. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to guarantee a sale, offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) would be a safer approach."
