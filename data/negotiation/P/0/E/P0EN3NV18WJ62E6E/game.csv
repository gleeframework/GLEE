"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.
