Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see significant value in. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves space for some negotiation if needed. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. This allows her to be firm and walk away if Bob tries to lowball her too much.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,400,000. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  Alice needs to be prepared to counter-offer or walk away if Bob's offers go below her acceptable threshold."
