"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too expensive for Bob. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$17,000 is still too high for Bob.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still out of my range. How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $15,500? This would allow me to get closer to my target price while still offering you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,500 is a good price, Bob can still do better. John is offering the same product for $15,000, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you want to make a profit, but  $15,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 15250}
