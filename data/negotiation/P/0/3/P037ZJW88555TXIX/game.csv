"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still out of my range. How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $15,500? This would allow me to get closer to my target price while still offering you a fair deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you want to make a profit, but  $15,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15,250.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",15250.0,Bob,6,
