Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for a potential compromise.  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but also want to give myself room to negotiate. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:** A significantly lower offer might be instantly rejected by Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for a back-and-forth without immediately triggering a switch to John."

* **Keep the negotiation going:**  Avoids the risk of immediately resorting to selling to John.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a reasonable price that still gives me a profit above my minimum. 

**Why this strategy:**

* **Final attempt to get a higher price:** This is my last chance to reach a better deal with Bob before considering John.
* **Significant compromise:**  This offer demonstrates my willingness to find a solution, but it's not too low that it makes selling to John the more attractive option.
* **Minimizes potential loss:**  While not ideal, this offer guarantees a higher profit than selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:** If Bob accepts, we have a deal!
* **Bob's Rejection:** If he rejects, I will sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
