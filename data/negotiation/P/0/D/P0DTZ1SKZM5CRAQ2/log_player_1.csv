Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $155. This is still above my minimum, but I'm hoping to find a compromise that will make the deal work for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150, so I'll accept this offer."
