"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
