"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product given its value to him."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $82 is only slightly above John's offer of $80, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. With only two rounds left, there's a good chance I won't be able to get a better price from Bob. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
