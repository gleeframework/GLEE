"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $9,500. 
* There's room for negotiation, as you can likely get a better price.  
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price of $8,500, which is still above Alice's minimum of $8,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to get a good deal.
* This price is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $9,500, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting. 
* I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground, hoping for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counter-offer of $9,700 is higher than my previous offer of $8,500 and is only slightly lower than her initial offer of $9,500. 
* This suggests she might be unwilling to negotiate much further.
* However, I still believe there's room for negotiation, as I'm willing to pay up to $12,000. 
* I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is showing a willingness to budge slightly by lowering her offer from $9,500 to $9,700.
* My counter-offer of $9,000 is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer of $8,500. 
* This shows a good faith effort to reach an agreement, while still trying to get a price lower than her initial offer.
* This price point is within my budget, and I believe it's a reasonable offer that Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is increasingly unwilling to compromise, raising her offer to $9,800 after rejecting my counter-offer. 
* This suggests further negotiation might be futile, and she's likely aiming for a price close to her initial offer.
* Buying from John for $12,000 is a more certain outcome and avoids the risk of further back-and-forth with Alice that might lead to a higher price.
* Although it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget and avoids potential frustration with a prolonged negotiation."
