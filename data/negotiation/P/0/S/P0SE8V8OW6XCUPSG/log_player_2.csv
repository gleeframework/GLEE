"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  You want to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my limit of $10,000 but still leaves some room for potential compromise. This is a moderate starting point that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still better than buying from John for $10,000, and it's closer to my desired price of $10,000. It's a fair compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance she'll be less willing to budge, and I might end up paying more or having to buy from John.  I'm going to accept the offer and get the product."
