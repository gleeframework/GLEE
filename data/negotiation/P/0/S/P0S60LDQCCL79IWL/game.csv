,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $780000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $820000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's compromise at $805000. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our goals.  What do you say?",805000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $805000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $815000, which is a compromise that I think we can both live with. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,5,
