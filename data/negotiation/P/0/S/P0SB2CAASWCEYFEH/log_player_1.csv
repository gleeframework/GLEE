Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $10,000, so $14,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It signals you're serious about selling but are open to a compromise. 

This is just the first step, though.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
