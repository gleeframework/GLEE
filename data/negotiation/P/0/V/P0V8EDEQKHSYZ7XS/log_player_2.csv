"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. It's still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $12,000.** This is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price.
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob might end up paying John's price of $15,000.

It's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a good price."
