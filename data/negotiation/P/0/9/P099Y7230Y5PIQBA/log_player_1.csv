Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting us closer to our ideal price.
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable and worth a slightly lower price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes we don't know if Bob is aware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he'd have no incentive to offer more than $12,000.
* This is a single-shot negotiation.  There's no opportunity for counter-offers or building a relationship for future deals."
