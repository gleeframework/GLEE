"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, I'm not sure $1500000 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to offer $1000000.  This reflects the value I see in the product based on the information I have.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I believe the true value of this product lies closer to my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the unique benefits of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1100000?  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while still giving me room to work with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
