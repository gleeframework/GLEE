"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets us close to my goal of maximizing profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer but still aiming for a price closer to my desired goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price. $900,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. We have time and I'm not desperate to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to cave in easily. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. If Bob rejects this next offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my goal. I'm offering a compromise, but it's the lowest I'm willing to go. If Bob rejects, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's significantly less than what I was aiming for, but it's more than John's offer and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  There's a risk that if I reject and counteroffer again, Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer."
