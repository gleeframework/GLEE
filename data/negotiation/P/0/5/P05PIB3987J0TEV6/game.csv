"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1900000?  This would allow me to still make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we perhaps meet closer to my budget at $1750000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1750000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1700000? This would be a fair compromise that respects both of our needs.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
