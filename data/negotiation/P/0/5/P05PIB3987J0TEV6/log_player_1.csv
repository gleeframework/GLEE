"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's uniqueness and potential for investment, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open Communication:** I encourage Bob to respond, leaving the door open for a dialogue. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll be carefully analyzing Bob's response and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds based on his behavior. If he seems hesitant, I'll likely lower the price gradually. However, if he's showing serious interest, I may try to maintain a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a bit too low.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Round:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $1,800,000 and my initial offer of $2,000,000. I will adjust my next offer based on how strongly Bob is interested and how willing he is to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This would allow me to still make a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality. "", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the product's quality, reminding Bob that a slightly higher price is justified.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I frame the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially reducing any resistance.

**Next Steps:** I will closely observe Bob's response in this round. If he's receptive, I may consider a slight adjustment to my price in future rounds. If he's still unwilling to budge significantly, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or explore the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Could we perhaps meet closer to my budget at $1750000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistence:**  While Bob is coming closer to my minimum acceptable price, he's still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows Bob that I'm not desperate to sell. It keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate further. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, likely around $1,700,000.  I'll be looking for signs of Bob's commitment and adjust my offers accordingly to either close the deal or prepare to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,700,000? This would be a fair compromise that respects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Reason:** I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations and propose a middle ground, aiming for a reasonable and fair compromise. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I'm not accepting his offer yet, but I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price closer to his offer.
* **Time Factor:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between being persistent and closing the deal before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully assess Bob's response in this round.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
