"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. This is my highest offer for now.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your honesty about its limit. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This recognizes the value while still giving you a significant return.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from $2,050,000. Would you consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. While $1,900,000 is still a bit under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept it on the condition that we can finalize the deal today.  Does that work for you?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
