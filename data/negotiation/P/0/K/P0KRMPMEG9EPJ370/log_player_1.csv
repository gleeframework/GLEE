"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $10500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I have 9 rounds left, and there's still potential to increase the price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about $11,000?  I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,000, which is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by suggesting a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation constructive.

**Next Step:** I'll closely watch Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10750.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  We're only in Round 4, and there's still ample opportunity for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John is tempting, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $11,250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,250, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,750). This shows a willingness to meet in the middle while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""fair price for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Staying Positive:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Step:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll be more inclined to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to find a price that's closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $11000, which is halfway between our last offers. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $1,000 below my ideal outcome.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I have 4 rounds left, and there's still potential for Bob to increase his offer. He's demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and is already closer to my target price.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a fair deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $11,200. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm using a direct call to action (""Let's see if we can close this deal."") to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Step:** I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the remaining rounds accordingly. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll be more likely to sell to John in the following round."
