Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price. Accepting his offer is the best option because:

* **It secures a sale:** It avoids the risk of Bob further lowering his offer or me potentially having to accept John's lower offer.
* **It's close to my minimum:**  $9,000 is only $1,000 below my initial offer and  $1,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, it's a good compromise to secure the sale quickly."
