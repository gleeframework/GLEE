"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing a price of $10,750 for the product. This still reflects its value to you while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,750 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,250 for the product. I believe this is fair, considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
