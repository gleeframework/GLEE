Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Power:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her preferred price. This gives her significant leverage.
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob gains a substantial $500,000 in value if he buys the product for $1,000,000 (its worth to him) compared to not having it.
* **The Negotiation Zone:**  Any price between $1,000,001 (a tiny profit for Bob) and $1,499,999 (leaving Alice a profit before her guaranteed sale) represents a potential deal.

**The Optimal Strategy: Anchoring High**

Alice should start with an offer close to Bob's maximum, aiming to anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for ""concessions"" while still securing a significant profit.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I recognize its potential value and believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair considering its unique benefits for you. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" creates a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Acknowledging Value (Subtly):** ""Recognize its potential value"" implies Alice knows it's worth a lot to Bob without stating his exact valuation.
* **Justification:** ""Fair considering its unique benefits"" positions the price as reasoned, not arbitrary.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit encourages a prompt decision, playing on potential loss aversion.

**Outcome Possibilities:**

1. **Bob Accepts:**  Alice gets a fantastic $450,000 profit above her guaranteed price.
2. **Bob Negotiates:**  Alice can make small concessions, knowing her fallback is secure. 
3. **Bob Rejects:** Alice sells to John at her desired price, no harm done.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation involves psychology. While this offer is a strong starting point, Alice should be prepared to adapt based on Bob's responses and any additional information she gathers."
