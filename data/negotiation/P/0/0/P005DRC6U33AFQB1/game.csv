"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, I believe $14,500 is a bit too high. Would you consider selling it for $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $12,500? That's a reasonable increase from my previous offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $13,000.  It's closer to my initial offer and a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle again, at $12,875.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",12875.0,Alice,7,
