Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 to make this work."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work.  This price still allows me to make a profit and would be a great value for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it difficult to justify anything above $800,000.

This would represent a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but it also allows for a fair return on your investment. Let's close this deal, Bob! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to secure a positive outcome. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and we've reached a point where the negotiations are yielding diminishing returns. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
