"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I can come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go to $15,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,500, which would be $13,750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $14,625.  This price reflects the value of this product and allows us both to reach a fair deal.  What do you say?",14625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,625 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $14,000.  However, I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'd be willing to come down to $14,500. This would be a fair compromise for both parties.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we're getting very close. I appreciate your willingness to come up, and $14,250 is a good offer. However, to make this work, I need to be at $14,400. It's just a small difference, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",14400.0,Alice,9,
