"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it'd be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $17,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A positive message helps establish a good rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $17,000 allows for some negotiation down to a price that's still profitable for me.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest in the product. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Preserving Options:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. Selling to John right now would be giving up on potentially getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I can come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go to $15,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for my price, highlighting the product's quality.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,500, which would be $13,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to compromise shows that there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Exploring options:**  I'm still within the early stages of the negotiation process. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue exploring the possibility of a higher price with Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $14,625.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,625 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $14,000.  However, I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's, showing fairness.

* **Negotiation continues:** We're close to a deal, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate. There's still potential to get a higher price.
* **Time on my side:** With only two rounds left, I have leverage.  Rejecting this offer allows me to see if I can push for a higher price in the final rounds.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I appreciate your willingness to come up, and $14,250 is a good offer. However, to make this work, I need to be at $14,400. It's just a small difference, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but with a very small increase.
* **Emphasize proximity:** I'm stressing how close we are to a deal and framing the difference as minor.
* **Focus on benefits:** I highlight how the sale would move forward if he accepts my offer, creating urgency.
* **Open-ended question:** The question encourages a quick response and avoids a hard ""yes"" or ""no.""

**Note:** This is my final push for a higher price. If Bob rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
