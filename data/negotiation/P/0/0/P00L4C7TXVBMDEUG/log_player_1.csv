Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and even if I go through the negotiation, it's unclear if we'll find a middle ground.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a better price, or move on to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to recognize your interest, but this is a significant product that brings substantial value.  Let's find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good deal and I'm confident that I can't get a better price from Bob, especially given the limited rounds."
