Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always best to try and get a higher price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it for less than this ensures he sees immediate value.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $1,150,000 price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price than waiting for John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have unlimited time. If you're not in a rush and John's offer is guaranteed, you could hold out for a price closer to $1,200,000 from Bob."
