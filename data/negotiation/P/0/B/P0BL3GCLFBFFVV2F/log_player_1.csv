"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product is worth $8,000 to you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
