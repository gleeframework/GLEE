Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also suggests a willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and while I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
