Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""its worth and potential,"" Alice is framing the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is open for discussion (""Let me know your thoughts""), showing Bob that Alice is willing to negotiate.

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and Alice has a guaranteed offer for that amount from John, she's in a strong position to aim for a higher sale price."
