"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its potential value, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's try this â€“ $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  It reflects a substantial discount from my initial asking price and provides a significant win for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $985,000. I think this is a very fair price, considering it's closer to my initial offer, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",985000.0,Bob,6,
