"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm initially setting the price at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you do $1,800,000? This product truly is exceptional and will bring you a lot of value.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
