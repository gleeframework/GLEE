{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's still attractive to Bob (since it's below his estimated value) but allows for negotiation.  It's also above my minimum, leaving room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is tempting, it's below my minimum of $8,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price point, or at least secure my minimum.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7,500, so I'll offer $8,250. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is higher than my minimum of $8,000 and is close to my ideal price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
