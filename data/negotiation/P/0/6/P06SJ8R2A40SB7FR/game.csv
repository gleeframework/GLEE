"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7,500, so I'll offer $8,250. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",8250.0,Bob,4,
