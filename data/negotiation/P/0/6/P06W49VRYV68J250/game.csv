"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $13,500? That's a significant step closer to your offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you consider $12,800?  I feel that's a fair offer and we can close the deal.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,800 is getting close, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to come up to $13,200?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can do $13,000.  That's pushing my budget, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,8,
