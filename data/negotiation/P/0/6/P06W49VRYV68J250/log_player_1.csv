"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which still reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about $13,500? That's a significant step closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Would you consider $12,800?  I feel that's a fair offer and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers and end up selling to John, I'll miss out on the opportunity to potentially get a higher price from Bob in a future round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,800 is getting close, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to come up to $13,200?  That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I can do $13,000.  That's pushing my budget, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of rounds. I'm afraid that if I reject Bob's offer, I might not get a better price in the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to secure a safe and acceptable deal."
