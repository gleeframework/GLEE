"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  You can always buy from John later if the negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, you anchor the negotiation lower.  This gives you more room to negotiate upwards.
* **Knowing Your Limit:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice values it at $10,000.  Starting at $10,000 immediately tests if Alice is willing to sell at her perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves space to potentially meet in the middle during future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice moved down from her initial offer, which is a good sign.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a gap between her offer ($10,500) and your ideal price ($10,000).  
* **Limited Risk:**  You have several rounds left, and you can always buy from John for $12,000 if needed. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a classic negotiation tactic: meeting directly in the middle of the current price gap. 
* **Showing Willingness:** It demonstrates to Alice that you're willing to move closer to her price, encouraging her to do the same.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still below your maximum budget and a good deal compared to John's offer."
