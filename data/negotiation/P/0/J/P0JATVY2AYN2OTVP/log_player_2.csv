"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is better than buying from John, but it's still above Bob's desired price point.  There's still room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject this offer and counter again."
