"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,000? It's still a great price for you, and a fair compromise for me.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $12,800. Can you consider that?",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,800 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
