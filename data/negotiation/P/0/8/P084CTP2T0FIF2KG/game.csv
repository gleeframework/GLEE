"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $750,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential. However, $750,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider  $550,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $675,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I see you're willing to meet me closer to the middle ground, which is appreciated. How about $610,000? I'm trying to balance getting a good deal with investing in a product that will help my business grow.",610000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still not willing to go as high as $610,000, but I'm willing to consider a slightly higher price. I'm going to counteroffer at $640,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",640000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I understand this is your highest price, and I respect that.  To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to come up a bit.  Would you consider $625,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in this product.",625000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm still not willing to sell at $625,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm going to counteroffer at $650,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Alice,7,
