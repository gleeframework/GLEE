"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm being optimistic and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to potentially sway him. 

This is just the first round, and I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. I'm also keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal with Bob. 
* **Sell to John is a safe option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and a good backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground by coming down from my initial price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and how this price still represents a good deal for him. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting to ""close the deal"" to incentivize Bob to act.

This is a strategic counteroffer that balances the need to make a profit while keeping negotiations open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation window shrinking:** We're already in round 4, and selling to John is becoming a more attractive option. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I still have 6 rounds left, and there's a chance Bob might come up further.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. However, I'm also carefully considering the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I value this product highly, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it offers.  How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm maintaining a flexible approach while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Slight concession:** I'm offering a smaller concession than Bob's previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value and the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the need to ""make this happen"" to encourage a swift decision.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving while putting pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my minimum.  I'm also closely monitoring the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to offer $980,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum but not enough:**  Bob's offer is only $20,000 away from my minimum, but it's still not reaching my desired profit margin.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is the safe option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum and removes the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'm close to reaching my desired price, the time constraint and the potential for Bob to counteroffer further make selling to John the most logical and secure decision."
