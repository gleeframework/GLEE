"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,500,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $1,650,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While your offer is tempting, I'm holding firm on the value this product brings. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,600,000? This represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
