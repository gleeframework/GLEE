"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value for me, and still a significant profit for you. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
