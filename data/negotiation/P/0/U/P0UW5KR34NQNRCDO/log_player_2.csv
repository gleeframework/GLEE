"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price point that makes this a mutually beneficial deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Alice. 
* **Your Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $950,000 
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to her. You can likely negotiate a better price with Alice. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of counter-offers or negotiation."
