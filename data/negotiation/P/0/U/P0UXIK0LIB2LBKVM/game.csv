"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $900,000? I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I'm willing to drop my price a little more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,000,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still leaves you with a valuable product at a price you can afford.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
