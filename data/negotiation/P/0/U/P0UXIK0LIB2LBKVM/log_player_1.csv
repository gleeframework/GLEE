Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try to get closer to my original offer of $900,000? I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $950,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, $950,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for anything drastically below my minimum. I'm still hoping to get a better price and close this deal without having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us. I'm willing to drop my price a little more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,000,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still leaves you with a valuable product at a price you can afford."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
