"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15000, and it's getting close to the $8000 I'm willing to pay.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. Considering its value to me is $15000, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
