Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's a valuable item and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. It also acknowledges the value of the product while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to accept it. The product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I need to negotiate further. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,500 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum than my previous counteroffer.  It's also within a reasonable range for the perceived value of the product.  Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale and secure a profit."
