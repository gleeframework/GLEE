"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob, even though the price is above his perceived value. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible while still securing a deal within the 10 rounds. I'm willing to negotiate but will also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price in future rounds.
* **Staying strategic:** Selling to John now would secure a higher price, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining my value:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, but significantly closer to his perceived value, making it a more appealing proposition.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise that will lead to a deal within the remaining rounds. By showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my minimum, I hope to reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I've already shown flexibility, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but I'm not convinced that I can't get closer to that price with Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10,000 is getting closer, I still need to cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, suggesting that it benefits both parties.
* **Focusing on satisfaction:** I'm appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal while also implying that I'm seeking a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while also making a clear and concise offer that might entice Bob to accept. If he rejects it again, I'll need to consider if I'm willing to keep negotiating or if selling to John is the better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $10,200 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $10,200 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Limited rounds:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation period, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm not convinced that I can't get closer to my desired price with Bob in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to bridge the gap and keep the negotiation moving forward. I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $10,200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,350? This price allows us to both make a good deal and move forward.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10350} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference again:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($10,200).
* **Emphasizing a good deal:** I'm framing the offer as an opportunity for both of us to ""make a good deal"" and ""move forward."" This appeals to Bob's desire for a win-win outcome.
* **Remaining firm:** I'm still not willing to accept a price significantly below my minimum. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. With only a few rounds left, I need to be decisive and move towards a final agreement.  If Bob rejects this offer again, I will have to seriously consider selling to John, but I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,100. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the last two rounds, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** With each rejection, Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller, and I'm doubtful that he'll budge much further.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $15,000 will ensure I get the maximum value for the product, which is my primary goal.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement with him is too high.  Selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation that may not lead to a favorable outcome."
