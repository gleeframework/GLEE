"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with our goals.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10,000 is getting closer, I still need to cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $10,200 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while still being within my budget.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,350? This price allows us to both make a good deal and move forward.  What do you think?",10350.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,100. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests.",10100.0,Bob,8,
