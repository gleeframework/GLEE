Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  Mentioning other interested buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable.
* **Justification of value:**  A brief mention of the product's value and potential subtly reinforces the price justification.

**The goal is to find a balance:**  You want a price Bob might accept, knowing he's getting a good deal compared to its true worth to him. However, you also want to maximize your profit, considering you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 if Bob declines."
