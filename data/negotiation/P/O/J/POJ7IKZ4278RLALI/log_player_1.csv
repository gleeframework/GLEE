Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $110, which I believe is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($120 - $80 = $40) while still ensuring Bob sees a benefit ($120 - $110 = $10 savings).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
