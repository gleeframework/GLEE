"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering the product for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $900000 is still a bit too low for me,  but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $925000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  It's a win-win situation.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close.  $910000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $915000 to make this work for me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",915000.0,Alice,7,
