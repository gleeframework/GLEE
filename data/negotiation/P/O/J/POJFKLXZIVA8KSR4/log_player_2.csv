Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering the product for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $900000 is still a bit too low for me,  but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $925000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  It's a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close.  $910000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $915000 to make this work for me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is only $15,000 more than what you'd pay John. While you could keep negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and the time remaining in the negotiation suggests it's a good idea to accept her offer."
