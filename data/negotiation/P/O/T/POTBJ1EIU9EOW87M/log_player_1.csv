"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's room to come down in price if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Expressing confidence:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** Selling to John for $8,000 would guarantee my minimum, but there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within negotiation range:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Positive messaging:** The message reiterates my appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasizes the product's value to justify my counter-offer.
* **Open to further discussion:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation needed:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price, and risks delaying the sale.
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting the offer guarantees a successful sale without any further risk.

While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are minimal and the risk of a failed deal is high. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure my minimum profit quickly and efficiently."
