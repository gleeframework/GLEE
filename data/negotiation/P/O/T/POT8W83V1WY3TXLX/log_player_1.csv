Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $100.  I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($80) but still reasonable, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm expressing a willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob more likely to engage.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and maintaining an open dialogue for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($80). While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price right now. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and focusing on finding a fair price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""a fair price for both of us"") to make it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  What do you think?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking a deal with John for a potentially higher offer from Bob. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation."
