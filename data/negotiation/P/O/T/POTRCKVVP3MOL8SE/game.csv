"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is already a very competitive price considering the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I'm confident this would be a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
