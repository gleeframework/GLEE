Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good profit for me. If Bob rejects, I can always counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in the value of my product. This counteroffer is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable, and I'm starting to lose confidence in our ability to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's time to move on and secure a guaranteed sale to John."
