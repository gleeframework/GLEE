Round 3
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, $75 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we make it $110 and call it a deal?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $92.50. My final offer is $100.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $100. It's better to buy from John for $80 and save the $20 than risk Alice not budging and missing out on the deal entirely."
