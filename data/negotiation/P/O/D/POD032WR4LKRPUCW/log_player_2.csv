"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's worth seeing if you can get it lower. There are still 9 rounds left, and you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $15 reduction from the initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise.
* **Sets the tone:** This counteroffer positions you as a serious buyer while also signaling you're not afraid to push for a better deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but it puts the pressure on her to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice has moved closer to your price, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than you'd like. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting the offer, you keep the negotiation going and can potentially get a lower price.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 7 rounds left, and John's offer is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $82.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $80? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, but it's still a step closer to your goal. 
* **Positive tone:** The message reinforces your interest in the product and your desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** You haven't given up your desired price point, keeping the pressure on Alice to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $81? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $81 is very close to your desired price of $80. 
* **Time is running out:** You only have 5 rounds left, and while you could try to push for a lower price, it's risky to keep negotiating.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always buy from John for $120. 

At this point, it's a good gamble to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's still within your budget."
