I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as I'm aware I could always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

$120 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for that price.  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $140.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to lower my price that much.  It's more profitable to sell to John for $150."
