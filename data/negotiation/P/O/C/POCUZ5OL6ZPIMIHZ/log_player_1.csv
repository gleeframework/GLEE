Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to his maximum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  We don't want to start at Bob's absolute maximum ($1,500,000) because that leaves no space to negotiate if he's inclined to haggle. 
* **John as a Backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, it's in our best interest to try and secure a deal with Bob first since he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant amount, it's still $100,000 less than our initial asking price and $200,000 below his perceived value. We have room to negotiate further.  

By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about obtaining a price closer to our target. It opens the door for a counteroffer where we can aim for a price between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, and to find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By countering at $1,375,000, we're splitting the difference between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Subtly reminding Bob of the ""value"" keeps the product's worth at the forefront of the negotiation.
* **""Fair Compromise"" Language:**  Framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise""  encourages Bob to view it positively and potentially accept the offer."
