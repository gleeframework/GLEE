"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets a strong initial benchmark and allows room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's true value to subtly nudge Bob towards seeing its worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message conveys willingness to negotiate, making the offer seem more flexible and approachable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates interest and a willingness to negotiate. This gives me hope for a better deal in future rounds.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, which is still my minimum. However, I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique value while also acknowledging your financial limitations. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's financial limitations, which helps build rapport and shows I'm trying to find a solution.
* **Compromise and Middle Ground:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, but still maintaining a significant profit margin. The term ""middle ground"" suggests a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price. This keeps the focus on the product's worth, even while making a concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss.
* **""Final Offer"" is a Bluff:**  While Bob claims this is his final offer, it's likely a negotiation tactic to pressure me into accepting. 
* **Better Options:** I can still counteroffer or sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a much better outcome. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:**  I'm making another compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a substantial profit.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to see the value in a deal.
* **Finality with a Twist:**  I'm not explicitly stating this is my final offer but adding a sense of urgency with ""Let's work together to close this deal."" This implies a willingness to negotiate but also suggests a deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. My final offer remains at $800000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.  Please let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on his offer of $800,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not optimistic about Bob increasing his offer.
* **Securing the Minimum:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum profit and avoids the risk of a further price drop from Bob. While I would prefer to get more, this is the most sensible option given the circumstances."
