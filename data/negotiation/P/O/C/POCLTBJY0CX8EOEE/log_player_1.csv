Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale."
