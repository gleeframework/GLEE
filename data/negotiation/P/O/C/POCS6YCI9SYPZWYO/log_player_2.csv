I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  It's my maximum price, but I want to see if I can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm going to offer Alice $100.  This is a significant discount from her initial price, and I think it's a fair starting point for negotiations."
