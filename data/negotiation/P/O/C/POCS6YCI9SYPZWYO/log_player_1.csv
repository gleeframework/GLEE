"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm setting the initial price at $120, which is higher than the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($100) to give myself some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($100), I'll choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $100.
