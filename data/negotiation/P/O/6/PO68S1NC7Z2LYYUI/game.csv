,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I understand you also see the value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Perhaps we could agree on $12,500?  This feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is important to you, but I have a budget in mind. Could we make it $10,500? That's a significant jump on my end.",10500.0,Bob,6,
