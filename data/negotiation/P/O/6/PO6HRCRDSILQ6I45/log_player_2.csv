Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep negotiating, $128 is a good deal considering my limit is $150 and John's price is $150."
