"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this initial offer, you might be able to get a better price from her, closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
