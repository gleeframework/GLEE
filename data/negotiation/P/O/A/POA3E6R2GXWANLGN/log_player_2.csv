"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's in your best interest to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,000,000), I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer leaves ample room for negotiation, allowing me to gradually increase my bid while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Communication:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her offer of $1,400,000 is still above both my maximum price and John's offer. While it might seem tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? I'd be willing to go up to $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by increasing my offer, but I'm still staying below my maximum budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts me closer to my target range while leaving space for a potential final counteroffer from Alice that might be within my budget.
* **Maintaining Respectful Negotiation:** I'm continuing the negotiation with a positive and respectful approach, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which matches John's offer and is my maximum budget. There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as it's unlikely Alice will go lower and I'd be risking losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
