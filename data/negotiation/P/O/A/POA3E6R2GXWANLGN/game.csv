"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $1,400,000 for the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle somewhere in the middle? I'd be willing to go up to $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you're comfortable with.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
