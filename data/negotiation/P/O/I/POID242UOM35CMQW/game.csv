"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity cost of going elsewhere. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant profit for you.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I can buy it elsewhere for $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
