"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,400,000 is far more than his target price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant profit for you.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you say?

Bob should still reject the offer. While $1,200,000 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. There's still room to negotiate further."
