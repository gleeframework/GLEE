Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value ($1,500,000), hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the value difference ($800,000 for Bob vs. my minimum) makes the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not my absolute final price, allowing for negotiation.  
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity cost of going elsewhere. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. This presents an opportunity to counter with a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a significant profit for you.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential profit he'll make by purchasing at this price. 
* **Set a Deadline:**  I'm stating this is my final offer, adding pressure to reach an agreement.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I can buy it elsewhere for $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiations are unlikely to succeed:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his offers are consistently far below my minimum.  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  It's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might result in a lower price."
