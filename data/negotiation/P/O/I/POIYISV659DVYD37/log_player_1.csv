Round 2
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm hoping for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I can come down to $175, as it's a really good product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I want and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a profit now than risk ending up with nothing."
