"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This sets a high bar and allows for potential negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be intrigued enough to counteroffer, giving us room to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $17,000. This is still a good profit for me and is closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $15,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering John is willing to pay this amount. I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to a deal while also leaving little room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't going anywhere quickly.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I get a fair price for my product and don't risk wasting more time with Bob."
