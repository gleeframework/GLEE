Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Slight Discount:** Offering a small discount from my guaranteed sale price to John ($150) might entice Bob while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he negotiates, I know he's interested but wants a better deal. If he outright rejects it, I can always fall back on selling to John."
