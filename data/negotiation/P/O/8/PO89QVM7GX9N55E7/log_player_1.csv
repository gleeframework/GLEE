"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to maximize my earnings while still giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's latest offer. I'm showing flexibility while aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000, which is getting closer to my ideal price. While I would prefer more, I'm concerned that further negotiations might lead to a lower offer or even a rejection from Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing a potential buyer."
