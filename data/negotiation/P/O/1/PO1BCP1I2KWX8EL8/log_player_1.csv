Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a much higher price.  I'm not going to sell to John for $1,000,000 unless I have to, so I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer. This will allow me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I know the product is worth more to me.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial assessment.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I am not willing to sell for that low of a price. I know the product is worth more than that, and I'm going to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it still keeps the price above Bob's latest offer.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting too low for me to feel comfortable with.  While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most sensible option.  It ensures I get a decent return on the product without risking further negotiation that might lead to an even lower offer from Bob."
