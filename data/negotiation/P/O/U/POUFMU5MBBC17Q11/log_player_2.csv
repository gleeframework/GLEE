# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm trying to make a deal here! I can do $10,500, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. If you're not serious about $10,500, I'll have to consider other options. What's your real bottom line? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is clearly very firm on $10,500, and with only one round left, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high. Accepting now secures a reasonable price and avoids the risk of overpaying with John."
