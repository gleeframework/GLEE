"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I have to make a living, you know! I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $9,750 is still a bit shy of what I was thinking. I can do $10,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let me know if it's a deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'll meet you at $10,500, but that's it. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm not going any higher.",10500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting a little frustrating.  You're not moving much. I'll offer you $10,200, but that's absolutely my final offer.",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm trying to make a deal here! I can do $10,500, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. If you're not serious about $10,500, I'll have to consider other options. What's your real bottom line?",10500.0,Alice,9,
