Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a strong opening:** It leaves room for negotiation but still offers a good profit margin for you.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not afraid to ask for a price close to what you know it's worth to Bob.
* **It's inviting:** The message encourages Bob to respond and engage in a dialogue.

**Important:**  Remember, you can always make adjustments to the price and message depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I am unable to agree to $9500. Would you consider lowering the price to $8200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $8,200 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your ideal price. It's worth attempting to negotiate further.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,850? I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8850}
