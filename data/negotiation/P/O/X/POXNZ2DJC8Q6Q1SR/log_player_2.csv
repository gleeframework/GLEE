Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is significantly below the value this product holds for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,350,000. This price allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too far below what this product is worth to me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product while still allowing me to benefit from the deal. Let's reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already very close to his maximum price point, and this offer is still above it.  He should see if he can get Alice to come down a bit further. If Alice doesn't budge, he can always go with John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,310,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,310,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,317,500.  This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll receive from this product. Let's seal this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,317,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,317,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  He's already very close to his maximum price point, and Alice is not budging much further.  While there's a chance he could get Alice to come down a little more, it's not guaranteed.  By going with John, Bob can secure the product at his desired price and avoid further negotiations."
