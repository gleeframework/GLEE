"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm framing it as justified by the ""value and potential"" of the product.  This emphasizes its worth without revealing my own minimum.
* **Open to Discussion:** I want to appear flexible and willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup offer. This gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, I was hoping to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter was expected, accepting $1,000,000 would be a substantial loss. I'll use the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to a price point that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a fair and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting a price exactly between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming high. 
* **Firm but Fair:** Calling it a ""fair and final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and implies that I'm unwilling to go much lower. However, using the word ""fair"" softens the tone and avoids seeming overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Position:** Offering my minimum acceptable price might seem risky, but it establishes a strong anchor point for further negotiation. It also allows me to gauge Bob's true interest â€“ if he's not willing to budge closer to this number, it might be time to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we are getting closer. While $1,500,000 is still a bit high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000 to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's still significantly below my minimum.  While he states $1,500,000 is ""a bit high,"" his counteroffer suggests he has room to move. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push him closer to $1,300,000 - $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be frank,  $1,100,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for this. I believe that reflects the true value while still making it a beneficial deal for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Respectful:**  I'm being transparent that Bob's offer is too low without being dismissive of his efforts.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my higher price and nudge him towards a more substantial increase.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 shows flexibility and encourages a counteroffer, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum.
* **Time Consideration:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, so I'm aiming for a price that avoids prolonged back-and-forth while leaving some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're firm on the value, how about we settle at $1,250,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it work if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and is now a reasonable profit above his perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiation Progress:** We've made good progress in the negotiation, with both sides making concessions. Accepting now capitalizes on the positive momentum.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further for a potentially small gain ($50,000 - $150,000) carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or stalling the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, accepting Bob's offer provides a good return and avoids potentially starting the negotiation process over with another buyer."
