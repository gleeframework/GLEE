"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,000 at this time.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $7,750 is still a bit low. How about we settle at $8,250?  This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,5,
