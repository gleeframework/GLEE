Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a good profit while also being open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that leaves me at a loss. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a fair price for the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum value of $120 and  is a reasonable compromise. It's better to sell to Bob for $100 than to John for $120, as I would get to keep the product and potentially sell it for more in the future."
