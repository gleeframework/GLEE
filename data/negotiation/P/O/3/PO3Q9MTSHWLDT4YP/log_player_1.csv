Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe we can get closer to $1,400,000 with careful negotiation."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is still moving upwards, even if slowly. We're getting into the later rounds, so it's time to apply a bit more pressure and see if we can get him closer to at least $1,350,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a number that truly reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your urgency, but I'm not willing to pay $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm starting to consider other options, including buying from John for $1,200,000. Can you think of a better price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting tricky. Bob is playing hardball and using John as leverage.  Let's analyze:

* **We're past the halfway point:** With only a few rounds left, the pressure is on.
* **Bob's increases are small:** He's moving, but slowly.  He might be at his limit.
* **The gap is closing:** The difference between our offer and his is getting small. 

While it's tempting to push for more, the risk of losing him to John is real.  

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's better to secure a good deal now ($1,325,000) than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer."
