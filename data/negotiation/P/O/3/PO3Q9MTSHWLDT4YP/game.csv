"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,600,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm open to negotiation. How about we settle at $1,450,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we discuss further?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This represents a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we meet somewhere in between?",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a number that truly reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.  I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your urgency, but I'm not willing to pay $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm starting to consider other options, including buying from John for $1,200,000. Can you think of a better price?",1325000.0,Bob,8,
