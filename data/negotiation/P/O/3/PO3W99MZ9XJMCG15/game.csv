"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,125,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,250,000.  This product has immense potential, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
