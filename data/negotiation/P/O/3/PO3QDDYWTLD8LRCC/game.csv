"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a good deal for both of us - I get a great product and you get a good price.  Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,000? This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!",11000.0,Alice,3,
