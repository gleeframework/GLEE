Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value, but still lower than my minimum. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation in case Bob counteroffers. I can lower the price slightly if necessary, but I'll always be mindful of my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Backup:** John's offer of $12,000 serves as a safety net, ensuring that I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a good deal for both of us - I get a great product and you get a good price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer below my minimum. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a lower price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,000? This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob offered $10,500, which is below my minimum.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise at $11,000, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still ensuring I'm not giving away too much. 

I believe this is a fair compromise that increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob."
