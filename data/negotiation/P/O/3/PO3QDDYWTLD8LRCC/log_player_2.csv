Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,000? This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!
