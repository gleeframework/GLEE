"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  This is the absolute most I can afford at this time.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product and the substantial returns you'll see. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too far below its worth.  Could you consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
