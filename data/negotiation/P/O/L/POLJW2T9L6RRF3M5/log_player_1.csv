Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but I can't go higher than $1,400,000.  This is the absolute most I can afford at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and closer to my reserve than my initial ask.  I need to push him considerably higher to make this worthwhile.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.
