"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see some movement from your side. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,500,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
