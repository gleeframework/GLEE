It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can save money by doing this."

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You can likely get a better price than $1,250,000."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still higher than what John is offering. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if you can reach an agreement."
