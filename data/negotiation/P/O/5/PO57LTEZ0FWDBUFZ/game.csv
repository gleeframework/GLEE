"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
