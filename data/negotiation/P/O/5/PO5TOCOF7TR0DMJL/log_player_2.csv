Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $106.25 and $109, which would be $107.625. However, I can round that down to $107.50. Would you be willing to go that high? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5

Alice has come down significantly, and I'm comfortable with the price. It's a good deal considering my limit and the fact I could always buy from John."
