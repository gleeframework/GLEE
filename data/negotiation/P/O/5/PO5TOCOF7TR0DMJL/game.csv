"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I can do $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $112.50 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $106.25? I think that would be fair to both of us.",106.25,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,109.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $106.25 and $109, which would be $107.625. However, I can round that down to $107.50. Would you be willing to go that high?",107.5,Alice,5,,
