,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart in price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $137.50?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $137.50 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we try $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $120. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",120.0,Alice,7,
