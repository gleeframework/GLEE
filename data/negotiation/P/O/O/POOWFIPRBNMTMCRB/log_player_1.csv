Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, but you've also given yourself some wiggle room. 
* **It's a reasonable price for Bob:** The price is lower than the product's value to him, making it likely he will consider the offer. 

Let me know if you want to adjust the offer or if Bob makes a counteroffer, and we'll continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $100 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

Let's see if we can bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is above your minimum:** $110 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Shows flexibility:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Provides a strong reason:** You've emphasized the value of the product to justify the price. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or if we need to continue negotiating!"
