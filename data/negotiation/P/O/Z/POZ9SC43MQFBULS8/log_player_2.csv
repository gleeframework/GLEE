"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice's offer is way too high. It makes sense to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer of $50.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial price and shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's likely she'll reject this offer, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $175 is closer to my limit, it's still too high. I'll reject the offer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $75. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's still significantly lower than her last offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is a bit closer to my limit, I'm not comfortable with that price yet.  I'll reject and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $90. This is a significant move, and I'm hoping it will be close enough to her desired price to reach a deal. If she rejects, I'm getting close to my limit and might have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to pay over $100. I'll reject and see if I can get her down to my desired price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $95, which is just a little above my initial limit.  If she rejects, I'll go to John and get the product for $100."
