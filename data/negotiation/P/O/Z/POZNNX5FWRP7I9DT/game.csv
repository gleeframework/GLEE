"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity. I think you'll love this product, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $800000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to be honest with you, I was hoping to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to consider $1100000 as a compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I can't go any higher. I'm confident this product will be a good investment for me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not convinced we're at a good meeting point. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1050000 is a better offer, it's still a bit outside my range. To make this work, I need to stay at $950000.  I truly believe this product will be a great investment for me, and I hope we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in talks. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I'd rather sell to John. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
