Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe it offers great value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $120 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your earnings.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $119, offering a slightly lower price of $110 leaves room for potential counter-offers or adjustments. This strategy increases the likelihood of closing the deal at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80). 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable sale with Bob and ensuring you don't undervalue the product if you need to sell it to John."
