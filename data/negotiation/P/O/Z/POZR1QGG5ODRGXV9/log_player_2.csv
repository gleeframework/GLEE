{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible while still buying the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000, which is still above Bob's maximum price point.
* **Better Option:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially reaching a more favorable agreement with Alice. 
* **John:**  While John offers a guaranteed purchase, it's not the most cost-effective option. 

**Next Step:** Bob should counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still buying the product. 
* **Starting Point:**  Bob knows Alice values the product at $10,000, so a price closer to that would be more beneficial. 
* **Counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate.

**Next Step:**  Wait for Alice's response to this counteroffer."
