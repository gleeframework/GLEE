Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a good starting point because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him an incentive to negotiate, but also leaves room for me to make some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and doesn't leave much room for profit. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is still a lower price than my initial offer of $130, but it's a higher price than his offer of $90. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept a price that is too low for me. I believe that this price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Although I would like to make a sale, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. It's more profitable for me to sell the product to John for $150."
