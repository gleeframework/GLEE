Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit significantly above my minimum.  I'm aiming to understand Bob's interest level and gauge his potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get closer to my target. There are still rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my target.  Considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of ending up with John's offer, I'm going to accept this offer."
