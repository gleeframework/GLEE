Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000, meaning she won't sell for less. John guarantees this minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice needs to offer a price attractive to Bob (below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing her profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Profit for Alice:**  Alice secures a $400,000 profit, significantly more than her $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob saves $100,000 from his perceived value, making it a good deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, there's potential for negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation. If she did, she could push closer to $1,500,000."
