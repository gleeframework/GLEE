Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. There's no risk of losing the sale entirely.

By starting at $1,350,000, we create the possibility of:

* **Bob accepting immediately:**  We get a good price and close the deal quickly.
* **Bob negotiating down:** We have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit above our minimum."
