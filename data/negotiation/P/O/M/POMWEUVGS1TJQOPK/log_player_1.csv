Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price or potentially secure a deal with John for a slightly better price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to secure a deal with Bob that meets my minimum threshold. Even though I've been able to negotiate a higher price, it's not quite enough to make me comfortable.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
