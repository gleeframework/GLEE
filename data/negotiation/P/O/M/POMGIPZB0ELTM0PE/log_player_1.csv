Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I can't afford $17,000. Would you consider selling it for $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
