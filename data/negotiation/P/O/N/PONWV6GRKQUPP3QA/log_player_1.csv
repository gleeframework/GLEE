Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is not what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $80, so I'll counter with $110. Can you consider that?
