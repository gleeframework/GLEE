"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However,  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price for this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,125,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
