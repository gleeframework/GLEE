```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is obviously trying to wear me down and get the lowest possible price. He's moving in far too small increments. At this point, the potential gains from continuing to haggle with him are outweighed by the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
