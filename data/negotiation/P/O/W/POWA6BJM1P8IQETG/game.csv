"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $1200000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering it to you for $1350000. This is my final counteroffer for now, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another slight adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is my next best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000 is too low, so I'll meet you halfway from there, at $1275000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
