Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate but not that far down. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is simply too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4

I'm still not comfortable with $95.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $100."
