"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. My asking price is $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $65. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down to $90 for you, but that's really my lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $90, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that's your lowest, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price, and I still have some negotiation rounds left.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, let me know, otherwise, I may have to move on to other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $85, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also adding a sense of urgency by mentioning other buyers to see if it motivates Bob to accept.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
