"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above your target of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $10,500. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer and puts us closer to my target price of $10,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hopeful she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is only willing to come down $500 from her initial offer. While $11,000 is better than her first offer, it's still above my target price. John is offering the product for $10,000, which is my maximum budget. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as I'm not likely to get a better price from her. I'll take the guaranteed deal with John."
