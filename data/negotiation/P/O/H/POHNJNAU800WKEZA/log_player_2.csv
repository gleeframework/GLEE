"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting it. You know John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, so Alice may be willing to lower her price further to secure the sale."
