Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. How about 1092500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,092,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's getting risky to continue negotiating. You've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not closing the deal.  John is offering the product at your target price, so it's best to buy from him and secure the purchase."
