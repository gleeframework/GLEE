Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  $700,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's say $850,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward!

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go that high.  My final offer is $750,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering market value and the benefit it brings to my business. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs and the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's benefits and its potential for your business.  It's a win-win situation, and we can move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
