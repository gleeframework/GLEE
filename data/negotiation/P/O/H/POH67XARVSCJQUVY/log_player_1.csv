"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the potential benefits for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is my starting point, I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room to negotiate, I can maximize my chances of getting a price closer to my minimum while still allowing Bob the opportunity to feel like he's getting a good deal. I'll also be keeping a close eye on how many rounds are left and the potential for selling to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. It's a fair offer considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Although Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for negotiation. We've had one round, and there are more rounds available.
* **Selling to John is an option:** While I want to make the most money possible,  $1,000,000 from John is a secure option. I'll keep this in mind as we proceed through the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll be cautious and consider the remaining rounds and John's offer as I make my decisions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product truly is a valuable asset.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits for your business. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and its potential benefits to his business. 
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  I'll continue to assess the situation based on the number of remaining rounds and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This offer reflects a serious commitment on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While it's an increase from his previous offer, $700,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** We have six rounds left, and Bob has shown willingness to negotiate.  There's still time to try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a safe fallback:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, which is still a good outcome.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll keep in mind the remaining rounds and the potential to sell to John as a safety net.  My goal is to find a balance between maximizing my profit and reaching a deal before time runs out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  $700,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's say $850,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's latest offer ($700,000). This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value and urgency:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the importance of closing the deal. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm presenting the offer as a win-win for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal while still staying above my minimum. I'm aiming for a swift resolution, as time is a factor in this negotiation.  I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go that high.  My final offer is $750,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering market value and the benefit it brings to my business. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $750,000 is still lower than my $1,000,000 minimum.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss at this point.
* **Four rounds left:** We have four rounds remaining, which gives me some time to try to push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:** If I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob, John's offer of $1,000,000 is a very secure option.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and the security of John's offer. My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping in mind the risk of not reaching a deal with either buyer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs and the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's benefits and its potential for your business.  It's a win-win situation, and we can move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm making a final offer that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. 
* **Emphasizing the win-win:**  I'm reiterating the benefits of the product for Bob and framing the offer as a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Urgency and closing:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by emphasizing the need to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

By offering $800,000, I'm taking a risk, but it's a calculated one. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer.  I'm also considering the remaining rounds and the potential to sell to John.  This is a crucial round, and I'm aiming for a decisive outcome."
