"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This sets the negotiation in my favor.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $13,000 is still significantly above Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** This price forces Bob to make the first counteroffer, giving me control over the initial negotiation steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is still below my minimum valuation of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Maintaining control:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the next counteroffer and potentially gain a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  $11,000 is a significant jump from Bob's last offer, but still lower than my initial proposal. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a higher price point.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Moving:** This counteroffer keeps the dialogue open and encourages further negotiation."

* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum valuation of $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:** While it's higher than his last offer, $9,500 is still significantly below my desired price and even my minimum valuation.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only four rounds remaining, there's a risk of running out of time without reaching a satisfactory price. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.
* **Potential for a higher price:** By rejecting his offer, I can control the next counteroffer and potentially push for a price closer to my desired value.  
* **Weighing the risks:**  While selling to John would guarantee a certain profit, I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."

{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer,  showing a significant willingness to compromise. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  While $10,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's close to my minimum valuation of $15,000. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds remaining, this is my last chance to secure a deal with Bob. 
* **Weighing the Options:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell the product to John to avoid potentially running out of time."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high.
* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While his offer is higher than previous ones, it's still below my minimum valuation and unlikely to increase further. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a substantial profit of $15,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While continuing with Bob might potentially yield a slightly higher price, it carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
