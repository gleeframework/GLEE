I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering the high demand and limited availability of this product. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice's message hints at some negotiation tactics (""special introductory price,"" ""high demand,"" etc.).  You know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's room to try and get a better price from Alice."
