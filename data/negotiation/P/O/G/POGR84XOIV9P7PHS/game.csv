"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you, and it allows for a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant saving, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
