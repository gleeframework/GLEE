"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $10,500. I believe that's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
