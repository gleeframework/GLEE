"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $825,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $900,000. This still leaves you with a good profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
