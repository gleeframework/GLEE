"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my bottom line.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $10,800 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference at $10,900? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10750.0,Bob,6,
