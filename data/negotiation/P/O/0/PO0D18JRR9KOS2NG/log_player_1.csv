Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my bottom line."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $10,800 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference at $10,900? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting very close to my bottom line. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to remember that I'm limited to 10 rounds and John is willing to buy the product for $10,000.  Accepting Bob's offer will secure me a better price than selling to John."
