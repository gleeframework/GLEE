# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $9,500. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.

You can still try to get a lower price.  $9,000 is better than $9,500, but it's still above your ideal price point.  Let's see if you can negotiate further."
