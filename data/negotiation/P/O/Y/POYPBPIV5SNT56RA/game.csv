"Hi Alice,  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to the price I'm aiming for. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
