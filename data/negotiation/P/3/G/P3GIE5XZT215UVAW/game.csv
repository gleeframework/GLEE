"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, but I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000 so I can't hold onto this offer for too long.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
