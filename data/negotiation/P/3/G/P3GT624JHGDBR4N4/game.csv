"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're willing to consider your request, but we still believe the product's value to you is higher than $975,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer the product at $1,025,000. We think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
