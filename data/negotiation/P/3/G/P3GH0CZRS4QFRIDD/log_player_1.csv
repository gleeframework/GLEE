Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By starting at $9,500, you allow for potential counteroffers from Bob without jeopardizing your minimum.
* **It's a good starting point for a potential win-win scenario:**  Bob is still getting a good deal at $9,500, as the product is worth $10,000 to him. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly below the $9,500 you initially offered.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, there's still room for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to make a counteroffer to Bob that is more appealing than the $8,000 John is willing to pay. This will ensure you're maximizing your profit potential."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your interests. 
* **Fairness:**  $9,000 is a fair middle ground between your initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  The product is still worth $10,000 to him, so $9,000 is a good deal for him as well.

Let's see if Bob is ready to finalize the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to lead to a higher price.  There is no benefit to continuing the negotiation, as you can get the same price from John immediately. 

**Why this is the best choice:**

* **Time is money:**  You're saving time and effort by selling to John right away.
* **No risk:**  You're guaranteed to receive $8,000, your minimum threshold.
* **No further negotiation:**  You're avoiding the possibility of further back-and-forth with Bob, which could lead to a stalemate or a lower offer."
