"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We believe it's a game-changer and would like to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my price range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. We believe this price still reflects the value of the product, while also being more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget:** $875,000 is only $75,000 more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and the risk of getting stuck in a long negotiation increases.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By continuing to negotiate, Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at the lower price of $800,000. 

While it's not the absolute lowest price, accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer."
