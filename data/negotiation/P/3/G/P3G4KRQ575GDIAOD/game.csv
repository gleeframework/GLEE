"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my price range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. We believe this price still reflects the value of the product, while also being more in line with your budget.",875000.0,Alice,3,
