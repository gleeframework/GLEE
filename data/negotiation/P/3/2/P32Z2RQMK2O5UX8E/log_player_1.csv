Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $2,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential negotiation. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** Showing you're willing to negotiate but not giving away the entire value. 
 
If Bob rejects this offer, you can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your initial offer and leaves a significant gap between your desired price and Bob's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $11,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's time to accept the offer.  Bob's counter-offer of $11,500 is only $500 less than your previous offer of $12,000. It's getting closer to your ideal price, and you're risking losing the sale entirely if you keep pushing.  While a higher price would be nice, it's important to balance that with the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's lower offer."
