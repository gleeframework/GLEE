"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $90}

This is a reasonable price that should be attractive to Bob, and it's still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price. I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob. Since Bob was willing to pay $85, I'll increase my price slightly to $87.50. This should be a reasonable compromise, and it's still lower than the maximum price Bob is willing to pay.

{""product_price"": $87.50}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'll try to get closer to his original offer of $85. I'll make a new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $86}

This price is slightly higher than my previous offer, but still lower than Bob's original offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and accept this price."
