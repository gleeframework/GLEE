"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95, slightly above Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but still gives me a good margin. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a deal closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counteroffering with $82.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still well above my minimum price of $80. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to close the deal without needing to go back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer of $79 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that he'll accept my next counteroffer.  To minimize the risk of further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $80."
