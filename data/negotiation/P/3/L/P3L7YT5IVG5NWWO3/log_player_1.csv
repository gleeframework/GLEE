"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Positioning:**  Framing the product's value positively can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Discussion:** By explicitly stating your openness to hearing Bob's thoughts, you encourage a collaborative and potentially fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product.  There's substantial room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would mean a significant loss for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:**  Politely decline Bob's offer while reaffirming the product's value.
* **Significant Counter:**  While moving closer to Bob's offer, this counteroffer remains comfortably above your minimum and encourages Bob to engage in more serious bargaining. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Psychology:**  This phrasing can be persuasive, even though it's not a true middle ground based on your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** Bob's offer is inching closer but remains substantially below both your minimum and his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Progress:** His willingness to increase his offer suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **John Option:**  It's still too early to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. You have a good chance of securing a better deal with Bob with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  Let's settle on $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness with Flexibility:**  While acknowledging Bob's constraints, you're holding firm closer to your desired price. 
* **Strategic Price Reduction:**  The drop to $1,600,000 is significant enough to grab Bob's attention and signal serious intent to close, but not so much that you're giving away your position. 
* **Highlighting Concessions:**  By emphasizing your price reduction, you put subtle pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a more significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  However, there's still a substantial gap between our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair offer considering John is also willing to sell at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is his absolute maximum. He's also revealed he's aware of your alternative offer from John. This significantly weakens your bargaining position.
* **Unlikely Progress:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better offer. He's already at his limit and has little incentive to move higher.
* **Guaranteed Return:** John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. Accepting this ensures you achieve your goal of maximizing profit without the risk of Bob refusing further negotiation. 

While there's a chance Bob might reconsider if you hold out, it's a risky gamble. Accepting John's offer is the most logical choice to secure the best possible outcome in this scenario."
