"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's priced at $10000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. $9250 is still a bit above where I'm comfortable.  How about we meet in the middle at $8875?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us, and it gets me closer to my budget.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  $8875 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $9000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $9000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $8900? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  While $8900 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  Would you consider $8950? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",8950.0,Alice,7,
