"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,500 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for a much lower price. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $15,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is lower than her original price, it's still higher than his budget.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his target.  He should also keep in mind that he can always buy from John for $8,000, so he doesn't have to settle for a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given that it's still significantly lower than your original price and closer to my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what we both consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant concession from my initial offer.  This is a great deal for a product you won't regret owning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice has come down significantly, $11,500 is still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target. He should keep in mind that he can always buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't result in a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
