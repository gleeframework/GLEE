Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $115 is lower than Bob's value of $120, making it a potentially appealing offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to lower the price slightly, and if he counters, you can still potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $97.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $97.50 is close to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiations with Bob, especially since John is offering a guaranteed $100.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
