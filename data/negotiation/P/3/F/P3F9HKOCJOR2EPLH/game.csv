,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $97.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",97.5,Bob,4,
