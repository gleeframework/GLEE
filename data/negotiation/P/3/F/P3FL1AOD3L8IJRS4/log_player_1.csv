Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely experience."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong fallback option with John ($800,000), which gives us leverage.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
