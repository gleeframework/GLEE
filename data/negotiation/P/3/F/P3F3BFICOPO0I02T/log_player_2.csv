"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially save a lot of money.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control over the negotiation and potentially leads to a better price.
* **Buying from John immediately is not a good option at this point.** While John is willing to sell for your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice through negotiation."

Considering the product's potential, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1200000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $800,000.**  
* **This price is still within your acceptable range of $1,500,000.** 
* **Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying John's higher price.**

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product for a price that is both fair and within your budget."
