"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800000 is a bit lower than I anticipated.  Considering the product's potential, I'd be willing to pay $1200000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1200000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
