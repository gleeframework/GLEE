Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering its potential worth to your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so starting closer to that figure is beneficial.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still keeping Alice well above her minimum. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to accept quickly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair price"" and ""potential worth to your business,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's value, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed fallback option with John at $800,000. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
