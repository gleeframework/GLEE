"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the price further. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm prepared to compromise in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I have 10 rounds to make a deal, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **Exploring Options:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging Bob to accept the deal. 
* **Finality Implied:** The ""let's close this deal"" phrase subtly pressures Bob to accept, hoping he'll avoid another round. 
* **Balanced Approach:** $110 is still a good profit for me, but it's also a reasonable price for Bob, considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $108.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  We're only in round 4 out of 10. There's still time to push for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $120 is always an option, but I'm aiming for a higher price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm presenting $112 as a fair compromise, highlighting my willingness to negotiate.
* **Slight Concession:** While I'm not going all the way to his offer, I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price a bit.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating that this is a fair deal for both of us.

This strategy aims to:

* Push Bob closer to my desired price.
* Encourage him to accept before I decide to sell to John.
* Maintain leverage by leaving room for a small counteroffer if needed."
