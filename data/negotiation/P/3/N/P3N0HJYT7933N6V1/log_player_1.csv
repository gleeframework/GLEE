Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I can still make more money with Bob than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? That's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still better than selling to John for $120.  Let's take the deal and move on."
