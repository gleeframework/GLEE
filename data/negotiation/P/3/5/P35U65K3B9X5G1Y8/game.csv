"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, however, the value of this product is truly significant and  $900,000 falls short of what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $1,050,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still below the product's true value.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential returns you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
