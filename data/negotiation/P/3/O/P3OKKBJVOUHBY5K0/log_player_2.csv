"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's below my maximum budget but still offers Alice a decent profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 is a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

We're getting closer to a fair deal. This offer gives Alice her desired profit while still saving me some money. Let's see if she accepts."
