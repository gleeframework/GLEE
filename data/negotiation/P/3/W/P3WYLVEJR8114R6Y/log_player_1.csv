"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,500,000 valuation as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum valuation. I'll try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,100,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm getting closer. I'm going to try to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point.  Let's try $1,150,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit short. How about $1,075,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to Bob's price, but we're still below my minimum valuation of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price.  To secure my desired valuation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
