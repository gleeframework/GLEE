"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting at $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
