"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's far below my value. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
``` 

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for much less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I'm getting a decent price and moving forward with the sale."
