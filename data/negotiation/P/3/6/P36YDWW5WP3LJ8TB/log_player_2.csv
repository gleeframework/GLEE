# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a fair price, and I'll still be making a good profit.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
