"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a fair price, and I'll still be making a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a way to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
