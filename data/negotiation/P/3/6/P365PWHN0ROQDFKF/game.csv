"Alice, your offer is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise that hopefully works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
