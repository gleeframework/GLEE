{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, leaving room for potential negotiation.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $1200000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer. This presents an opportunity to potentially negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and attempt to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and I've already come down from my initial price.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or no sale at all."
