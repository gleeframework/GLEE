{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little below my minimum value but gives Bob some room to negotiate. It also shows I'm serious about selling to him but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product at $9,500, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $8,500 for this product. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $10,000. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I still cannot exceed $8,500. I am willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still below my minimum value, and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a worse deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
