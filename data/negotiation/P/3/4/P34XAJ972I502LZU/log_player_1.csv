Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low, considering the value of the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,280,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might be stuck in a loop here.  I'm willing to make one final concession, but I can't go lower than $1,290,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  The negotiation with Bob is getting tedious, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement that's good for both of us. John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is my minimum threshold.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
