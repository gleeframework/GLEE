"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than its worth to you, and I'll be earning a fair price for my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to accept an offer above that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or go with your backup option (John)."
