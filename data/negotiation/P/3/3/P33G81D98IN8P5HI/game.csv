"Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product for less than its worth to you, and I'll be earning a fair price for my investment. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
