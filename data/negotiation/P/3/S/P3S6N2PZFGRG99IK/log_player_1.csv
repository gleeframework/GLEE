Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer to Bob, considering Alice's position:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** Alice doesn't know Bob's exact valuation ($1,200,000), but she needs to aim for a price that's attractive while maximizing her profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** If Alice had more information about the market and comparable products, she could adjust her strategy.
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knew Bob was a tough negotiator, she might start with a higher initial price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If Alice needed to sell quickly, she might be more inclined to accept a lower offer from Bob."
