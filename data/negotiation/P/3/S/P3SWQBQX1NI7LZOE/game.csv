"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle on $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $825,000. It's a fair price that gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
