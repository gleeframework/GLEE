"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. This price is still within the range of its value to me, but allows room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value to me is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
