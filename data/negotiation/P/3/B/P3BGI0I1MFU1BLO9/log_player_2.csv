"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. This price is still within the range of its value to me, but allows room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It shows you're serious about negotiating but also gives you room to move if needed.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the value you see in the product, but also emphasizes your budget constraints. This builds a foundation for a fair negotiation. 
* **Potential for Agreement:**  This offer is still within Alice's desired price range. There's a good chance she'll either accept this offer or counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value to me is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, but $1,350,000 is still above your budget.  There's still room for further negotiation, and you should try to secure a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're willing to meet her halfway.
* **Final Stretch:**  $1,200,000 is a significant amount for you, but still leaves some room to negotiate if Alice counters.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains respectful and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution."
