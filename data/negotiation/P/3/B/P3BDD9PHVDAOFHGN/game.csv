"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That's a good price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 just doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $102.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it helps me get closer to my minimum.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I would like to propose $97.50 for the product. It's a reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions.",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good compromise considering our previous discussions.",100.0,Alice,7,
