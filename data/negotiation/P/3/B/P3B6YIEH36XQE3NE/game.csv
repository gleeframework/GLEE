"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $108. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $108 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $106.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $107. This is as low as I'm willing to go, though. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,
