"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can definitely do better than $12,000. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still in a good position. While $11,500 is closer to his ideal price, he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to counteroffer again and potentially secure a price closer to $9,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob should accept the offer. 

* **The price is getting closer to his target:** $11,000 is significantly lower than his initial willingness to pay $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the effort:** There's a good chance Alice might not budge further, and continuing to negotiate could waste time and potentially lead to a breakdown in the deal.
* **The risk of losing out:** If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice might get frustrated and decide to sell to someone else, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a much higher price.

It's generally a good strategy to accept a reasonable offer, especially when the potential gains from further negotiation are uncertain and the risk of losing the deal is high."
