"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $125 for the product?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little bit of a stretch for me. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How does $122 sound for the product?",122.0,Alice,5,
