# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get a better deal by counteroffering.  He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has dropped her price to $1,300,000, which is within his budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee that he'll be able to negotiate a lower price, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy the product."
