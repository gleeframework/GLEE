{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still give you a good profit and leave some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I know the product is worth to Bob. I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to give in yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
