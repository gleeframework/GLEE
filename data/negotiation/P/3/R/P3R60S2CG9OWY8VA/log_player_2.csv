"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it and get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than John's offer of $15,000.
* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
