Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but this is my starting point. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling yourself short and are still getting a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob knows he can get it for less than $12,000, but you're not giving it away either.
* **It's a clear message:**  You're stating your terms and showing you're open to discussion. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting a good price while still being willing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, you have room to negotiate further. Accepting his offer right away would leave money on the table. By rejecting and sending a counteroffer, you can try to push the price higher, potentially closer to your initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** It's above your minimum, ensuring you get a decent profit. 
* **Creating urgency:** By offering a lower price than your initial offer, you're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you're not willing to give it away. This can encourage Bob to come closer to your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am proposing a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $9,500.  This is a good compromise and a decent profit for you. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a small increase in price, and it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid sale."
