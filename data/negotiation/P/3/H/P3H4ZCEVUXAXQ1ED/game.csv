"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm happy to start the conversation at a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $1,750,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1375000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,375,000 is below the value I'm seeking for this product. To compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,625,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's continue this conversation and find common ground.",1625000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,625,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
