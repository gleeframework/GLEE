Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value but leaving some room for negotiation. This way, I can still potentially make more money but also avoid immediately losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming clear that we're too far apart on price.  To guarantee my desired minimum, I will sell to John for $15,000."
