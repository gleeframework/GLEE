Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. It represents a substantial investment on my end, and that price wouldn't accurately reflect its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this price offers a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. He's moved up $50,000, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below what John is offering. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $50,000.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
