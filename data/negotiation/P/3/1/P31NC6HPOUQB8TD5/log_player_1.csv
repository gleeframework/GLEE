Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signals to Bob that Alice is open to discussion and potentially a lower price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:** If Bob is highly risk-averse, a very high offer might scare him away.  Observing his reactions early in the negotiation will be crucial.
* **Time sensitivity:**  The prompt doesn't specify if there's a time limit. If Alice is under time pressure, she might need to adjust her strategy and potentially lower her asking price."
