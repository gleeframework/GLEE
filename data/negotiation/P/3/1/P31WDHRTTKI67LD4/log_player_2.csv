"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the incredible price of $14,000. This is a steal considering its value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""too high for my budget"") makes the counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball.
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Her offer is closer to her value ($12,000) than mine ($15,000 max). Let's see if we can nudge her down a little further."

""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Counter:** Alice met us halfway, so we're now countering with our ideal price. 
* **Justification:** We're framing this price as fair for ""both of us"",  appealing to a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Ready to Close:** This offer signals that we're serious about closing the deal if Alice accepts."
