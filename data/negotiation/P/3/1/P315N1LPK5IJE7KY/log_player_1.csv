Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant.  Could you consider a price of $925,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $825,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{

While we could try to push for more, accepting $825,000 is a solid deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
