"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and to Bob ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which will hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than simply rejecting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $8500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still push for a better price, especially since Bob is showing interest. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting his offer and counter-offering, I can potentially get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $8,750, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm trying to find a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($8,500) and my previous offer ($9,000).
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,600 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out another $100 or so, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or even a rejection, wasting valuable rounds.
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the sale to John, who is offering a guaranteed $8,000. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to maximize my profit while minimizing risk."
