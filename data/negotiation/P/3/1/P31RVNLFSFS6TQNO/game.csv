"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only willing to sell it to you at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering your own valuation. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant price reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal, I'm ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1,100,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, which is a slight increase from your offer. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
