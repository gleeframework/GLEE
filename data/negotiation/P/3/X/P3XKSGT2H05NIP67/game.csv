"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm trying to save as much money as I can. Can you consider my counteroffer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,250. Can you consider this price?",11250.0,Bob,4,
