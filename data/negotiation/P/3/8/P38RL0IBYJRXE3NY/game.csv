"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe you'll find it a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $14000.  This is my final offer, considering my budget constraints. I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $15500 for the product. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. Can you consider it?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price, but $15500 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $14500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to explore other options.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product. I've already come down from $18000 to $15500, and you're still not willing to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer, and I expect a serious response.",16000.0,Alice,7,
