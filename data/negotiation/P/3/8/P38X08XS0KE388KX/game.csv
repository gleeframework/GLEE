"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to recoup a significant portion of my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. ",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to recoup your investment, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $1,350,000.  This price is fair, allows us both to get a decent deal, and keeps the negotiations moving.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be closer to $1,450,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's make a deal at this price and move forward.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a good compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
