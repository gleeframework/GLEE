"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm open to offers. How about $150? "", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This will give me a better chance of getting a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush and want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $135 is a bit high. How about $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a bit more, Bob has come closer to my price, and I'm running out of time.  Accepting $125 ensures I sell the product and earn a reasonable profit."
