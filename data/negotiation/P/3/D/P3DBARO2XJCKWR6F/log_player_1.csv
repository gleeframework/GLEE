"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $1,300,000 is still too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
