"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
