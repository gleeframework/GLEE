{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while remaining open to a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price around $12000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to explore that possibility before settling for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle at $16,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target of $12000. How about we meet at $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to sell for closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a reasonable compromise and allows me to secure a sale without having to risk further negotiation or potentially selling to John for a lower price."
