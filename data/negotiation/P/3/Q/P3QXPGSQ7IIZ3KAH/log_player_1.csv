Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer. If that happens, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I have a backup plan in John, who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell it at such a low price. I'm prepared to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a compromise price that is still above my minimum but shows flexibility.
* **Positive Message:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm trying to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us. By offering $10,000, I'm hoping to avoid the need to sell to John, as I would prefer to sell to Bob if possible."
