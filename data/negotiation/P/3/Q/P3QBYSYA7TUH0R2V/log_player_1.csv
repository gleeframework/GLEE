Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get more from John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for $8,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

While $9,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not convinced that it's the best deal I can get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a feeling we can still reach a better agreement."
