(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  You have a better alternative with John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move on to negotiating with John, who is offering a better price."
