Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects your offer. Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message highlights the product's exclusivity and value.
* **High but Reasonable:** The $1,400,000 price gives you significant room to negotiate while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, mentioning other interested parties could encourage Bob to act quickly.
