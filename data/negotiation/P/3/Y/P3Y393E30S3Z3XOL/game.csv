"Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product looks promising, I'm only able to offer $850000 at this time.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to pay $875000. This price is a good compromise, and it allows us to both achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $887500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $887500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $875000.  This price allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome, and it's the highest I can go at this time.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $875000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement of $900000. I'm counteroffering at $882500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",882500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While I'm still not quite there, I'm prepared to offer $870000 as a final compromise. It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's make this deal happen.",870000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $870000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to meet my minimum requirement of $900000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to close the deal, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $885000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",885000.0,Alice,9,
