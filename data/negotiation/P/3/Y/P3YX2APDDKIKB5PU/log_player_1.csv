"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your belief in its value. However, I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that low. I'll provide a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget.  While I value your interest,  $12,000 is significantly below my bottom line. Could you meet me at $13,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $12,500 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or losing the sale entirely."
