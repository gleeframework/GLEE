"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's start our negotiation with this offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still come down in price if Bob counters.
* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  Bob is getting a $50,000 discount from the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than your initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer represents a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still earning a comfortable profit above your minimum of $800,000.
* **Appeal to fairness:** Highlighting ""fairness"" and ""great deal"" can encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $875,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a higher price. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** By rejecting, you can counter with a higher offer and potentially get closer to your target price.
* **Time is on your side:** You still have several rounds left to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth to you.  Let's compromise one last time. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This offer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him can encourage him to accept.
* **Appeal to satisfaction:**  Highlighting mutual satisfaction creates a positive feeling for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on your minimum:**  $880,000 is getting very close to your minimum, but there's still room to negotiate for a slightly higher price.
* **Time is running out:** You have only four rounds left, so pushing for a higher price now is crucial.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** You're getting close to a point where Bob may be willing to accept a slightly higher offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal here. I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $880,000 is still quite a bit lower than what this product is worth to you. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 one last time. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer shows you are willing to meet Bob halfway once again.
* **Sense of urgency:** Highlighting ""getting close to a deal"" and ""closing this deal"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $890,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to our last two rounds of negotiations. 
* **Close to minimum:** $890,000 is very close to your minimum of $800,000. While you'd ideally like a higher price, it's a decent offer, especially considering you could sell to John for $800,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, you risk Bob walking away and then potentially having to sell to John, which would be a significant loss for you. 

It's a risk vs. reward situation.  Accepting the offer secures a decent profit, while rejecting it risks losing the deal entirely."
