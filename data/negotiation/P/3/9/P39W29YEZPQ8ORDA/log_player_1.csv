{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $150.  It's not worth selling to him at that price.  You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $85 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $150 you can get from John.  You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your minimum acceptable value of $150, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 120}
