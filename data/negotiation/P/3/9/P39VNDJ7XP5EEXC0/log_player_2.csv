"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $9,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  He knows the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in this product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

``` 
Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has come down to $8,750, which is still a good deal for Bob, and is closer to his ideal price than John's offer.  At this point, it's probably not worth continuing to negotiate."
