"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. Considering its value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780000. I've already met you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I'll have to decline your offer and consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
