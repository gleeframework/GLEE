Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation, but not too low that she misses out on potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, who's willing to pay $15,000. This gives Alice leverage in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

The offer of $14,000 aims to:

* **Be Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than Alice's minimum and provides Bob with a potential $2,000 gain.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate down, Alice can slightly lower the price while still remaining above her $15,000 minimum.

By starting high, Alice maximizes her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
