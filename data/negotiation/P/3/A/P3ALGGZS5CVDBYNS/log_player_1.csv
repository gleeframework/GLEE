Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while my absolute minimum price is $1,500,000, I'm willing to negotiate to make this a win-win. How about we start the conversation at $1,900,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Starting at $1,900,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message hints at your minimum price without explicitly stating it, making the offer seem more grounded.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating a willingness to negotiate, you encourage Bob to engage in the conversation even if the initial price seems high.
* **Win-Win Framing:**  Positioning the negotiation as mutually beneficial encourages a collaborative approach.

**Remember:**  You have a strong fallback option with John, so don't be afraid to push for a higher price with Bob."
