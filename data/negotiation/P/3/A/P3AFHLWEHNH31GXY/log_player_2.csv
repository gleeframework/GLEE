Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  This is a good deal for you, as you're getting the product at your desired price.  Furthermore, if you reject this offer, you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice and would have to buy from John at the same price."
