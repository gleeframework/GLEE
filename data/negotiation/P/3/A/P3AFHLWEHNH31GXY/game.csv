"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product,  which is still a great price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still gives you a great deal. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement that works for both parties.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
