Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a fantastic deal, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $150 to me. Accepting his offer would result in me breaking even.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John at $150, it makes the most financial sense to sell it to him. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob if he's unwilling to meet my minimum price."
