"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and allows you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's work together to reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise considering my minimum asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the value I place on your product.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider my other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,
