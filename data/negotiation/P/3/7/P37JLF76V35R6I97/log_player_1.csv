Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also be aware of the $1,000,000 safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with him and potentially accept a price closer to his offer. However, I'm not willing to settle for $1,200,000 just yet. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering a price of $1,400,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to back out. While I'd prefer to sell for more, I'm confident that this is a reasonable price and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether."
