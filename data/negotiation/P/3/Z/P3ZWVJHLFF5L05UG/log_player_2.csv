"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  He knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $12,500 is still a bit below my target. I can do $13,500, which is a good compromise between our prices. Let's meet in the middle!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is closer to his ideal price, he knows Alice is willing to sell for at least $12,000.  He can likely get a better price with another counteroffer.  He's still better off than buying from John at $15,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $14,000, which is only $1,000 less than John's price.  At this point, Bob has reached the limit of his negotiation.  He can't get a significantly better price from Alice, and it's not worth risking further negotiation for a small saving.  He's better off buying from John, where he can be sure of a purchase at a price within his budget."
