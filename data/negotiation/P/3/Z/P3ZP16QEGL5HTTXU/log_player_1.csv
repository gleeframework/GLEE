"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $9,500.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.  $9,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise point considering Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had two rounds of counter-offers. I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of losing the deal to John is growing. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John at a lower price."
