Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This represents a significant savings for you, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $12,500 allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me significantly above my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit for him.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The offer isn't too aggressive, inviting Bob to counter without making him feel pressured.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and maintaining open communication for a successful negotiation."
