Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Offering $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  This price is likely to trigger a counteroffer from Bob, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further.
* **Safety Net:** I'm comfortable with this price because I can always walk away and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Analysis:** $90 is significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 than Bob's initial offer of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting the offer ensures a quick sale and eliminates the need for further negotiation.

Since I can always sell to John for $120, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise that maximizes my profit in this scenario."
