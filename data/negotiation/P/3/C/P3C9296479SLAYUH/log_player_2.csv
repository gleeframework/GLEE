{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal for Bob.  While $900,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get an even better price before committing."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible price.  A counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still represents a decent saving for Bob. This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice as it still provides her with a significant profit."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point. By offering $900,000, Bob is showing that he is serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to go any higher at this stage.  This is a fair offer that balances both parties' needs.  There's a chance Alice might accept it to avoid further negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to the price Bob is willing to pay, it's still a bit high.  At this point, Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate and shouldn't give up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $925,000, which is a compromise between Alice's last offer and his previous one. This offer shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product, but also that he won't overpay.  This is a fair price point that both parties might find agreeable.  With limited rounds left, there's a strong chance Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of rounds and Alice seems unwilling to budge on her price. While he could try one more counteroffer, there is a risk Alice will reject it, and Bob will have no time to negotiate further.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget. It's the safer option at this point."
