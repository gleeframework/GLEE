"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, he can start the negotiation process and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, and it's likely the negotiation will continue with Alice lowering her price slowly.  There's no point in risking further negotiation, as Bob can secure the product for his desired price from John right now."
