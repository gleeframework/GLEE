"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. There's a chance Alice values the product less than $1,000,000 and might be willing to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, you can explore potential lower prices without losing anything."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price shows you're serious about buying but also sets a clear expectation that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $800,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation and a potential compromise without pushing Alice too far.  
* **Open to Discussion:** The message leaves the door open for further conversation, allowing Alice to either accept, counter-offer, or explain why your offer is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 for the product. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe the value of the product will more than justify this price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but it's still above your preferred price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue exploring a lower price point. You can counter with a slightly higher offer than your previous one, showing progress while still trying to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still securing a better price.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, helping to build consensus.
* **Urgency:** The line ""Let's make it happen"" subtly conveys a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept the deal."
