"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900000 for the product. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe the value of the product will more than justify this price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
