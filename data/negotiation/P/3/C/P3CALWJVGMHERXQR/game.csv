"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,6,
