{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving you room to negotiate.**
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price ($120), giving you some flexibility.**
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to respond.** 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't cover my cost.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $100? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $97.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal outcome. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $92.5 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made multiple counteroffers.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm not willing to continue negotiating at such a low price. 

Instead, I'll sell the product to John for $120, which ensures I meet my minimum price and don't lose out on a better opportunity."
