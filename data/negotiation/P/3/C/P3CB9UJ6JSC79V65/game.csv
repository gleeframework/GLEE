"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start with a price of $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me.  However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Let's start with $100 and see if we can work something out.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $150? That's still above your proposed price but closer to what I can consider. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $150 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your suggestion. After careful consideration, I propose we meet halfway between your last offer and my initial proposal. How does $137.50 sound for the product price?",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $120.  It's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $125 as the product price. This is a fair compromise between our previous offers.",125.0,Alice,7,
