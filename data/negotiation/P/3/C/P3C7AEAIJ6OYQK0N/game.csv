"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good price for you and a fair deal for me.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a win-win!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's aim for $8,750.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,875. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I'm eager to make a deal, $8,875 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800, which is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. This is my final offer, let's get this done!",8800.0,Bob,6,
