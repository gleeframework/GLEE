"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you at $105 and then coming down to $110. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",110.0,Alice,5,
