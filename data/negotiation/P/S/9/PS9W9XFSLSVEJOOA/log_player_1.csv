This is a starting point. I'm aiming for the full $15,000, but I acknowledge that Bob values it lower. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have a better option with John. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which is $12,750. Can you consider this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,750 is tempting, I'm still closer to my desired price with John.  I believe I can push for a higher price with Bob, so I'll try to make another counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't close the deal with Bob, it's clear we're too far apart on price. I'm happy to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
