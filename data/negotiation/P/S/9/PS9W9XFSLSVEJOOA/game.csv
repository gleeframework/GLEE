"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. However, $12,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which is $12,750. Can you consider this price?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,750.  Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $13,125. This is a very fair offer, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",13125.0,Alice,5,
