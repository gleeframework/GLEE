"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save some money. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $9,000? That's the most I can afford, but I really like the product and want to make a deal with you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
