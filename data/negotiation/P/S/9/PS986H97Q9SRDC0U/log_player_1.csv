{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob:

* **Understanding the Values:** You know Bob values the product at $150, and you value it at $120. This creates a potential surplus of $30.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering the product at $140 lets Bob save $10 compared to his perceived value. 
* **Your Profit:** You secure a $20 profit, which is significantly better than the $120 you'd get from John. 

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of a quick and profitable sale."
