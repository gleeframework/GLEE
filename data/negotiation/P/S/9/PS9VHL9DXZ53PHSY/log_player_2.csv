Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,250. Let's meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $8,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,100. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,100 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of the price increasing or losing the opportunity altogether."
