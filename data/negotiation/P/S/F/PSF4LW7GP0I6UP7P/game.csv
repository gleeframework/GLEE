"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
