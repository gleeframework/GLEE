"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum limit of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice.  If that fails, he can always buy from John for his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to his target.  If that fails, he can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,175,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, who is offering the product at his target price.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids any further risk of negotiation."
