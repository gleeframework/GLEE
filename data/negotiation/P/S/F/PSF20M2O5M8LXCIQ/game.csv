"Hi Alice,  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $11000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  $11000 is still just a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $11500?  It's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while staying within your budget.  I'm confident you won't regret this investment.",11500.0,Alice,5,
