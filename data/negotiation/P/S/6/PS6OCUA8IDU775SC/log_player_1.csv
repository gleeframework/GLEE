Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""special price"" and hinting at the value, we subtly justify the price without explicitly stating Bob could get it cheaper elsewhere.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and open-ended, implying Bob can counter-offer if he feels the price is too high. 

This strategy maximizes the potential profit while leaving the door open for Bob to accept the offer outright. If Bob rejects the initial offer, we can always negotiate down or sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
