Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more to me than that, and I still have the option to sell to John.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'd really like to get it for $7,000 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to sell to John for $8,000, I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer again, aiming to secure a deal closer to my desired $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to drop the price to $8,250 to make this work. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'd really like to get it for $7,000. Can you consider going down to $7,500 or even $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,250 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident I can convince Bob to go a little higher with a final counteroffer.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but I'm still firm on $8,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a good investment for you.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.  It's your call."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'd really like to get it for $7,000. Can you consider one last compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm running out of rounds, and Bob's offer hasn't moved much closer to my desired price. While $7,000 is a decent amount, I'm not comfortable accepting it. Given the limited time, I'd rather secure the $8,000 offer from John.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity."
