,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $105, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to the price I was originally thinking.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
