"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand it's a bit high, but $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
