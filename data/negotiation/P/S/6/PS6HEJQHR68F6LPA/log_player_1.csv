Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize my profit. Offering the product to Bob slightly below John's price allows room for negotiation and increases the chance of Bob accepting.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $950,000  leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for me if he accepts the initial price.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to see its worth and justify the price."
