Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to what I'm looking for."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $16000. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.
