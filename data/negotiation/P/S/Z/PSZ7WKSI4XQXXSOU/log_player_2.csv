"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $650,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice's offer of $615,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement. I'm concerned that she's not willing to come down further, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too high.  To be sure I get the product, I'll buy from John. While it's not the best price, it's a safe bet to ensure I get what I need."
