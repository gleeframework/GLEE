"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This will hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate and potentially settle closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me, and I still have some negotiation rounds left. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but acknowledging that I need to be a bit more realistic. This offer leaves some room for negotiation but still ensures a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price. With only 5 rounds left, I need to be firm. I'm confident that Bob will accept, as he's already indicated he values the product at $10,000. If he rejects this, I'm prepared to go to John."
