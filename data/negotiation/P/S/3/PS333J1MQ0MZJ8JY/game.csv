"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. How about $1,000,000 for the product?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves plenty of profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, I would like to propose $1,050,000. This still offers a good profit margin for you while keeping the price within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
