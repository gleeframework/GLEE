"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $112? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. How about we meet in the middle one more time? I'll offer you $109, but that's as low as I can go.",109.0,Alice,9,
