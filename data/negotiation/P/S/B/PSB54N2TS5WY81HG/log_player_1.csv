Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
