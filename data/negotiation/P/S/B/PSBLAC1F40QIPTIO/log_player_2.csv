"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's well worth the extra $2,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice seems pretty firm on a price above your maximum. It's unlikely you'll get her below $12,000 at this point, so it's best to take John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
