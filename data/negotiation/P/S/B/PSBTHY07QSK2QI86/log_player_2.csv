Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $680000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $680,000 is still above my target. I'm going to try to push for a lower price. While I'm getting closer, it's not worth accepting a deal that still exceeds my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is getting close to my target price. I'm running out of rounds, and while I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure if I can get significantly lower than this. It's a good price compared to John's offer of $1,000,000, so I'll accept it."
