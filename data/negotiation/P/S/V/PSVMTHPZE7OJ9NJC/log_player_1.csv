Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I think it's a fair starting point given its potential, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Beginning with a strong offer ($1,100,000) leaves room for negotiation while staying well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically helps justify the high price, even though you know his valuation is lower.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Signaling flexibility encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process, increasing your chances of a favorable outcome.
* **Backup Plan:**  Keeping John ($1,200,000 offer) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, you have a strong alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum and even further from your initial ask. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about obtaining a price that reflects the product's worth. You'll aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap but keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly, especially considering its potential for someone like you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Meeting halfway between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($900,000) shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's value to Bob reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price point.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  Phrasing like ""meet in the middle"" and ""acknowledging your interest"" fosters a collaborative atmosphere and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there with $1,025,000. How about we split the difference and go with $962,500? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently aiming for the midpoint in each round of negotiation. While $962,500 is a significant increase from his initial offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You're better off rejecting this offer to signal that you're not willing to settle for significantly less than your product is worth. You'll need to carefully consider your next counteroffer, as pushing Bob too hard might lead him to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to move, the product's value to someone with your needs truly is in the higher range. Could you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a strong offer on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  You're conceding slightly from your last offer but remaining firm above the $1,000,000 mark, reinforcing your position.
* **Final Offer Tone:** The language used suggests this is a final attempt to meet Bob's needs while staying true to your valuation.
* **Urgency and Commitment:**  Highlighting this as a strong offer and your commitment could prompt Bob to make a decision.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You're getting closer to John's offer, so you're prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept or counter with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very consistently sticking to his midpoint negotiation tactic.  At this point, it's unlikely he'll go above $1,000,000, and even then, it will be a small incremental increase. You've demonstrated flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses with Bob and sell to John.  The potential gains from continuing with Bob are outweighed by the risk of losing a significant sum."
