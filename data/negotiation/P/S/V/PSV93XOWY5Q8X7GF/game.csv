,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market. However, the value of this product, especially given its unique features, goes beyond typical market conditions.  I could consider $2,000,000.  This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my willingness to make a deal, but it also recognizes the true worth of what's on offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'd like to meet in the middle at $1,900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
