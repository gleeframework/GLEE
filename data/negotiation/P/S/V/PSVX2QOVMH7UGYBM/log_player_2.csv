"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $13,000. It's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your budget of $12,000. 
* You want to save as much money as possible, so it's not worthwhile to accept her initial offer. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be willing to pay $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* I'm emphasizing my interest in the product to show I'm serious about buying it. 
* I'm also keeping in mind that I have 10 rounds, so I can be patient and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I value your offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we split the difference at $12,250? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my budget of $12,000, even with the ""compromise.""
* I'm still within my negotiation rounds, and I believe I can get a better price.
* I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. I really hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $12,000, signaling that I'm serious about this price. 
* I'm emphasizing that this is my ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept.
* We're only a small amount apart, so there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer."
