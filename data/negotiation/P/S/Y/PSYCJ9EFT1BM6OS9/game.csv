"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000? This is still a great price for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
