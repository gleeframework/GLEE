Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  However, I'm open to discussing a figure that feels mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make Bob more receptive to a lower, but still profitable, price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage and potentially reveal his budget limitations.
* **Value Justification:** Mentioning the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price to the potential benefits, justifying a higher price. 

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob, swayed by the anchoring and framing, counters with a price closer to his perceived value but still significantly above $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the conversation opens the door for negotiation.  Alice has room to lower the price while staying above John's offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  If negotiations fail, Alice can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. However, ethical considerations should always be factored into real-world negotiations."
