"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's still a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10750? I think that's a fair compromise.,10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $11250? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
