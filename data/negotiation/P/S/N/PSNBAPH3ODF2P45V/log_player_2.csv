"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $5,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to get a better deal.  Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, a significant counteroffer is a good strategy. Offering $4,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows your serious intent to negotiate, while still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $5,500 is only slightly higher than her initial offer. While it's still within your budget, you have 7 rounds left and the opportunity to buy from John.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open, potentially leading to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice raised her offer slightly, so it's time to raise yours as well. Offering $4,500 shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  You're still significantly below Alice's offer and your maximum budget. This approach allows you to continue the negotiation with a strong bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,000 is getting closer to your maximum budget.  However, you still have 5 rounds left and the option of buying from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you more time to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her price. You need to counter with an offer that reflects the increasing cost but still stays below your maximum budget.  $5,000 is a compromise, demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate but also highlighting your firm stance on the price.  This leaves room for further negotiation while still keeping your options open for a potential deal with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is getting very close to your maximum budget.  While there's still potential to negotiate, the risk of further price increases from Alice is high. You have only 3 rounds left, and it's becoming increasingly likely that you won't reach an agreement with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at a price within your budget and avoids further potential delays or price hikes. It's the most practical and secure choice at this point."
