"I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. What do you think?",160.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,170.0
"I understand that $180 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit.",170.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $165?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",165.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,175.0
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. How about we go up to $175, and we can call it a deal?",175.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand your need to make a profit, but $175 is still out of my budget.  Let's try $170 again. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",170.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,178.0
"I've already made a few concessions, but I'm still not willing to go below $178. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",178.0,Alice,7,,
