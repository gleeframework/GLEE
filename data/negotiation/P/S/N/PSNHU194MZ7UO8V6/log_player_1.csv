Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay is unknown. By starting at $20,000, Alice can get a sense of how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This knowledge allows her to be more confident in setting a higher initial price with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice might need to adjust her price during the negotiation."
