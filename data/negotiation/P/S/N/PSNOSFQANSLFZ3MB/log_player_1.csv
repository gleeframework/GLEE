Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us both to make a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still significantly below John's offer.  Time to push Bob a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 undervalues the product's potential.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 975000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we're still below John's offer, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $950,000 now is a good compromise to avoid the risk of completely losing the deal and having to rely on John."
