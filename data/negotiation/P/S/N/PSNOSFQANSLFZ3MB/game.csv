"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and would allow us both to make a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 undervalues the product's potential.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
