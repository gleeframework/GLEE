"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer reflects the value you see in the product, I believe $900,000 undervalues it significantly.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $930,000. This price point represents a significant investment on your part but also ensures a fair deal for both of us.",930000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $915,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",915000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to accept $922,500. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while upholding the product's worth.",922500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $922,500 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer $910,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a mutually beneficial deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
