Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob doesn't accept this initial price, it might make your subsequent offers (which will still be above your minimum) seem more reasonable in comparison. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to engage in a negotiation that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80, which is fair for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. By immediately accepting his first offer, you're leaving potential profit on the table. You'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Still Profitable:** $100 is still a significant markup from your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Clean Number:**  Offering a clean, round number like $100 can sometimes make it feel more appealing and easier for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? That's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $90 is a solid profit margin ($10 above your minimum) and a good compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely. It's unlikely you'll get much higher than $90, and you risk losing the sale altogether by pushing further. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now means you secure the profit and can move on to other potential sales."
