"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
