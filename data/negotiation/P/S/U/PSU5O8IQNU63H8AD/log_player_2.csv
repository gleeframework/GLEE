"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  While it's a good starting point for negotiation, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He has the option of buying from John for a much lower price, which gives him leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  Although it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as he can still get a better deal by counteroffering or by buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
