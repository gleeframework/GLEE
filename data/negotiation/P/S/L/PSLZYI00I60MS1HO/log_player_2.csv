"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still within Bob's budget.  There's a chance Bob can get the product for even less by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his ideal price and Alice's offer.  He's aiming to get the price down significantly, but also wants to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's a significant savings compared to John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get Bob a much better deal.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
