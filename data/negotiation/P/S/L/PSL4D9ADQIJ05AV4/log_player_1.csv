"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good return on the product. I've framed the message to highlight the value to Bob while also being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $15,000. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still lower than my desired price point. I believe I can secure a better price if I continue to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me another round to try and get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you some room to work with your budget.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
