"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.  Let's make this happen!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $1,750,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,600,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $1,400,000 is still too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. Can you meet me there?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
