Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,575,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

Bob is clearly trying to find a fair deal and moving towards the middle ground.  $1,575,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and waiting longer carries the risk of losing him entirely.  It's time to close the deal."
