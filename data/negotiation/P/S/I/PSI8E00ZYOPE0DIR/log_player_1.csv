{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $10,000, so you're leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to go lower than your minimum of $15,000, but not too much.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing you to potentially make a profit. 

You can adjust the price depending on how eager you are to sell quickly.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for your minimum!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, as I'm still hopeful to get closer to my goal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows you to stay within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,800 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum. I am going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, but I will also consider selling to John if the negotiation drags on."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm willing to compromise, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,150?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet on this price, but if not, I'll have to consider buying from John.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I am not eager to accept the offer.  I believe it is in my best interest to sell to John at $15,000, as this will give me a better profit and less stress overall."
