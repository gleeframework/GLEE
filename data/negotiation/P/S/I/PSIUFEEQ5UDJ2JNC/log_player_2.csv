Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $132.50. I'm willing to make another small concession, though. I can do $132. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $132, it's still above my maximum of $130.  At this point, I've reached my limit and feel that further negotiation isn't likely to get me a better price.  Buying from John for $150 is my best option, even though it's more expensive, as I know I can get the product without further hassle."
