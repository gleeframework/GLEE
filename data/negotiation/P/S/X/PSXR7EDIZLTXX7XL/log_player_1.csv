Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $85 is still below my minimum value, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $110 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $85.  Let's close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get a better price.  $85 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product. This is a significant discount, and I really want to make this deal work.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you're willing to come down.  But $100 is still too high for me.  I'm not going to go above $85.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached a point where Bob is refusing to budge on his price. I'm running out of time and need to secure a good deal. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming clear that a deal with Bob isn't going to happen. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get my minimum value."
