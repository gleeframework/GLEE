"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for less.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $17,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than his budget and John is offering the product for a better price.  It's still worth negotiating with Alice, as she's shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $16,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He's already made a counteroffer that Alice rejected, and Alice's new offer of $16,500 is still higher than his budget.  John is offering the product at his maximum price, so it's time to cut his losses and move on to a sure thing."
