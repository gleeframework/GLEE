"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That would be a great price for me and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,250?  This is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to come down another $100 to $8,600. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very close to finalizing this deal, $8,600 is still just a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident that if we compromise a little further we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $8,400?  This would be a fair price, and I'd be able to purchase the product from you immediately.",8400.0,Bob,6,
