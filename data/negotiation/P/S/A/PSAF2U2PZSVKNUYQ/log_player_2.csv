"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is overestimating your valuation of the product. While you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, you'd obviously prefer a lower price. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal with her or resort to buying from John at your maximum budget."
