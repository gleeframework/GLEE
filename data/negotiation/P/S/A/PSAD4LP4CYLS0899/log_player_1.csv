"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to start high to maximize potential profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards, but I'm not giving up on a good deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than I'd like to get. I'm going to hold out for more and see if I can push Bob higher in the next round.  I believe I can get a better deal if I'm patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for potential profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a good price, and he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might end up selling to John for the lower price of $12,000.  It's important to balance the risk of waiting for a higher offer with the potential of losing a good deal altogether."
