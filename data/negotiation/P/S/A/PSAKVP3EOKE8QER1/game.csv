"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $132? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $132 just doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $134? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $134. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132 and $134, which would be $133. Can we agree on that?",133.0,Bob,6,
