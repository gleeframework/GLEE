Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know its value is significant to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to benefit from the deal ($1,000 profit) while maximizing your potential profit ($4,000).

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob (who values it more) and getting a price significantly higher than your fallback option (selling to John)."
