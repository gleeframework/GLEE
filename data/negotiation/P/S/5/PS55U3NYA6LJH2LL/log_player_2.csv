"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a very competitive offer considering its value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a good starting point, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, so there's time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own value for it and the potential savings I'm offering.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility but is still asking for more than Bob's comfortable price point. While the offer is closer to Bob's target,  he still has room for negotiation.  There are enough rounds remaining to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us - I'd be getting a great product for a good price, and you'd still be able to sell it at a value closer to what it's worth to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,075,000, which is still a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000. While Bob might still try to negotiate further, he's likely to get a better price from Alice than from John. There's also a risk of further negotiation ending with a higher price, so accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
