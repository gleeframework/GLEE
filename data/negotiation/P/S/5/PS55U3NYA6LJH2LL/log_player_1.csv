Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering your own value for it and the potential savings I'm offering.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us - I'd be getting a great product for a good price, and you'd still be able to sell it at a value closer to what it's worth to you.  Let's close this deal!

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000.
