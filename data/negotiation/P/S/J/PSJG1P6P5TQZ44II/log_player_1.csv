Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your offer, but $80 is too low for this product. I could meet you halfway at $140, which is a very fair price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'm not willing to go below $140.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a better deal for me at this point."
