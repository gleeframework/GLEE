{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,250? This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me propose a counteroffer of $9,100 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,100 is very close to my minimum and is a fair compromise. It's also closer to my target price than selling to John for $10,000.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a prolonged negotiation and ensures a sale."
