"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are looking to pay no more than $800,000, and Alice's offer is $1,000,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.**  You can make a counteroffer that is more in line with your budget. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.** But it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as you might be able to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your business, $850,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still represents a significant value for you. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has come down, $950,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  You can make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your maximum. 
* **Buying from John is always a viable option, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first.**"
