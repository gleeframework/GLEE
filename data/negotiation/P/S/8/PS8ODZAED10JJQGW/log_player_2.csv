# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and we are nearing a price where further haggling might not yield much better results. Accepting at $1,050,000 secures a $450,000 savings compared to John's offer."
