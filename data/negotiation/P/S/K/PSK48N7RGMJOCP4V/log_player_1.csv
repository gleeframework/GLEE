{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your $10,000 minimum, meaning you'll be happy if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $500 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential back-and-forth.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This initial offer demonstrates that you're open to finding a price that works for both of you.

However, remember to be ready to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own risk tolerance.  If you're confident about getting a better offer, you might want to start higher. If you're eager to sell quickly, you might be willing to lower the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, rejecting his offer gives you more control. 

Here's why:

* **You're already getting $10,000 from John:**  Bob's offer doesn't improve on that. You're not losing anything by rejecting it.
* **Potential to get closer to your desired price:**  You can counter with a price that's closer to your target. 
* **It shows Bob you're serious about getting a better deal:**  A rejection makes it clear that you're not willing to settle for his lowball offer.

This doesn't mean you need to be stubborn.  You can still negotiate and try to find a middle ground, but you're in a stronger position to do so by refusing Bob's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,750?  This gives you a good price, and it's still fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:**  This offer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  This demonstrates that you're flexible and open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're still earning more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you're not losing out on the deal.

By choosing to counteroffer, you're showing Bob that you are serious about reaching an agreement, but you're not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $10500 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your minimum:** $10,500 is only $500 below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but he's now getting closer to his own bottom line. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If you reject his offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and you'll be left with the $10,000 offer from John.

While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, it's not worth risking the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit close to your desired amount."
