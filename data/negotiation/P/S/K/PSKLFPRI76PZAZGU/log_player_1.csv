"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's value to Bob. It's also below my minimum acceptable price. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,500?  This still leaves some room for profit for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can get closer to $10,000.  I have the option of selling to John for $10,000, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,800? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get to a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance we won't reach a price that works for both of us. It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I'm not confident that we can close a deal with Bob.  I'm better off selling to John for $10,000 and avoiding further risk."
