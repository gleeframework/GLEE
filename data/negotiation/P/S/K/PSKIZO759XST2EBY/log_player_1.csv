Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $11,500 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but not so high that it immediately shuts down the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:**  $11,500 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still getting a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John as my backup option, ensuring I can still get my minimum desired price of $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $10,800 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,800 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, so I have room to counter and potentially reach a better price.
* **John is a Safe Option:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price slightly.  
* **Maintain Profit Margin:** $11,200 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** The message maintains a friendly tone, keeping the negotiation open for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $10,900 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $10,900 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  We've already gone back and forth a few times, and Bob is not showing a willingness to move much higher.
* **John is a Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering."
