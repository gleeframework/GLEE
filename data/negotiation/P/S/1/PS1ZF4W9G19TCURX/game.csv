"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
