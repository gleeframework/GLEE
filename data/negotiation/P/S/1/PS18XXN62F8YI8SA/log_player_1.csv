Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference:  I'm proposing $1,275,000.  This reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.
