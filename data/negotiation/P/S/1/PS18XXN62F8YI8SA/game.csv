"Hello Bob, it's Alice. I'm happy to discuss the sale of this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference:  I'm proposing $1,275,000.  This reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
