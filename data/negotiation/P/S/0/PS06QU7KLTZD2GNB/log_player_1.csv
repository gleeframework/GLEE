{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, aiming to find a price point that works for both of us.  But, I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, ensuring I can always secure at least $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my target, but I still have room to increase the price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $1,000,000 to see if we can find a middle ground. If he rejects again, I'll reassess my options and consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than my original offer.  I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows me to stay within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $960,000 isn't ideal, it's close enough to my initial goal of $1,000,000.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000 because I'll save on any associated transaction costs or time spent negotiating with John. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
