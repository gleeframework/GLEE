Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $150, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. I'm hoping to get a higher price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $150 if Bob is not interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe the product is worth more than $150, and I'm hoping to get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still  above Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $160. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a significant increase from his first offer and a good deal for me. I'm not sure if I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
