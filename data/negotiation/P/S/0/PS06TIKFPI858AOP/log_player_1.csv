Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product,  which is still a significant profit for you and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
