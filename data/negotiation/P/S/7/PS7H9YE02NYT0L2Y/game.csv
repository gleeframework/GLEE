"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you halfway between $15,000 and $11,000, which would be $13,000. Would you be interested in that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  Could you do $11,500?  That would be a great compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really committed to making this deal happen. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $12,250? I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",12250.0,Alice,7,
