"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I believe this product is valuable, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a compromise I'm comfortable with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, which would be $1,125,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
