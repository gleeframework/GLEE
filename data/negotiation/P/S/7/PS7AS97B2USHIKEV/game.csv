"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,200,000 is still a bit too high, but $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price for me?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy today if the price is right.  How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,7,
