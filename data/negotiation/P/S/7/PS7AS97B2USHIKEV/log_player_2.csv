Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,200,000 is still a bit too high, but $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price for me?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $1,300,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and we're getting close to her likely bottom line.  Waiting any longer increases the risk of her digging in, and a $1,225,000 price is a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 offer.  It's time to secure the savings."
