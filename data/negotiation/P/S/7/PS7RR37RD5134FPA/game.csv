"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you'd be interested in. I'm thinking $120 would be a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $103.75. This is my final offer.",103.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $95, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",95.0,Bob,6,
