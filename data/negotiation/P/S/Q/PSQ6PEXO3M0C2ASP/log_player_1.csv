"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly stating what it is, leaving room for Bob to imagine its potential and justify the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, setting the stage for a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both our minimum and his own perceived value of the product. While his counter was aggressive, it signals interest. We'll reject this offer to provide a firm stance and guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit, it's a bit lower than I anticipated.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a more accurate reflection of what it brings to the table."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm, But Compromise:** We're moving down from our initial offer but staying well above Bob's initial counter. This signals willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  We are reiterating the product's value, aiming to gently steer Bob's perception closer to our desired price range.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The proposed price of $1,900,000 attempts to establish a more reasonable middle ground, encouraging Bob to engage in a more balanced negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we might have been able to secure a slightly higher amount with more rounds, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher. Accepting now secures the deal at a price that meets our goals."
