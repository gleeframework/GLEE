"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit, it's a bit lower than I anticipated.  This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a more accurate reflection of what it brings to the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but that price is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,500,000? I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the potential value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
