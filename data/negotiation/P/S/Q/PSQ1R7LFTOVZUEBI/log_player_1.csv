"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common negotiation strategy to start with a higher price to leave room for compromise. Since Bob values the product at $8,000, there's room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone can encourage Bob to be more open to the offer. 
* **First Offer:** This is the first round, so it's important to test the waters and see how Bob reacts.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $8,000.  Bob's offer of $7,500 is below that.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I want to close the deal, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows me to control the negotiation and counteroffer, potentially pushing Bob closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $8,500. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows flexibility while staying above my minimum price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and position my offer as a fair compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I add a touch of urgency (""Let's make this happen!"") to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Time is Money:**  I've already been through several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting this offer ensures I close the deal and avoid the risk of further rejection.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm not getting my desired price, accepting this offer keeps the door open for future business with Bob, potentially at a higher price."
