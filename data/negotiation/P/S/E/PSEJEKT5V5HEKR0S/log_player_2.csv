"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, you can still do better. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer without trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's slightly higher than John's price, but still within my budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This gives her some room to negotiate, while also keeping the price below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a better price than John's offer of $10,000. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely Alice will be unwilling to go lower than her current offer.  Accepting her offer allows me to save $500 compared to buying from John, making this the most financially advantageous decision."
