"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply isn't enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
