{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $115, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer if he wants. 
* **Having an alternative buyer:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold firm if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I can sell to John for $120, I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I believe there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired $115 or potentially even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $115 to $110.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that $110 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing his potential gain. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not going below my minimum acceptable price yet, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Encouraging response:** I'm asking Bob to let me know what he thinks, prompting him to continue the dialogue."
