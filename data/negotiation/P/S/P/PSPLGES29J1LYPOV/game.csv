"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed your expectations. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. Let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,875,000. This amount reflects a compromise that I hope will be acceptable to you.",1875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary constraints. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. I'm willing to adjust my initial offer, but  $1,875,000 is too significant a drop. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $2,062,500?",2062500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice's position and the value she places on the product. I'm willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,950,000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the product's worth.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  We're getting closer, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too low for me to agree to.  Would you be willing to consider $2,006,250?",2006250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I've reviewed our discussions and am prepared to offer $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this figure strikes a fair balance between respecting its value and adhering to my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  While $1,900,000 is a strong offer, I'm still seeking a slightly higher number. Could we settle on $1,975,000?  I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1975000.0,Alice,7,
