Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant amount but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to him and framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for his thoughts. This shows flexibility and encourages him to engage in the conversation. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob stall or go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also below the product's value to him ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and has shown willingness to compromise. 
* **Avoiding the ""Sell to John"" option:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, it's premature to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or somewhere in the middle ground between our current offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's keep the conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,050,000, he's getting a great deal compared to the product's value to him.
* **Maintaining optimism:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging further negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If not, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* **Keep John in mind:** I'll still consider selling to John if the negotiations with Bob go below my minimum price or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate further, and we are getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm hoping to reach a slightly higher price with Bob through continued negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,050,000, aiming to find a price that works for both of us. I'll continue to be mindful of my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John if negotiations become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's last offer of $975,000, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Framing it as a fair compromise:** I'm emphasizing that $1,025,000 is a fair compromise and a win-win situation for both parties.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, excellent! If he rejects, I'll have to assess the situation. If his next counteroffer is close to $1,025,000, I might be willing to accept.
* **John is still a backup:**  If the negotiations go below my minimum price or become unproductive, I'll still consider selling to John for $1,200,000."
