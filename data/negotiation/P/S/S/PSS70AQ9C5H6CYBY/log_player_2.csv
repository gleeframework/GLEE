Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

While I could try to push for a lower price, getting the product for $1,025,000 is a decent deal. It's a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and only slightly above my absolute limit.  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, forcing me to buy from John at full price."
