"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and its potential ROI warrants a higher investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be accommodating, but I also need to be mindful of the value of this product. My final offer is $1,280,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential returns you'll see.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
