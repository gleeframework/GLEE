Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $12,000,  I can gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counters, it shows he's serious and willing to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** I know I have John as a backup who will pay my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not desperate. This empowers my position. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I am fully prepared to negotiate with Bob to find a price that works for both of us, keeping in mind my minimum of $8,000."
