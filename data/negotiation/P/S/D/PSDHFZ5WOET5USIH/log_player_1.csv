Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Open-Ended:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling pressured. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,200,000. If Bob doesn't accept, I can adjust my offer based on his response and still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, while still showing flexibility and keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial $1,100,000.
* **Maintain Value:** $1,050,000 is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than my minimum. This shows I'm serious about a deal but not desperate. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize the potential for a good deal.
* **Open for Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter again, keeping the negotiation open. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while ensuring I still receive a price closer to my desired value.  If Bob rejects this, I can evaluate whether to further negotiate or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Bob has already rejected two offers, and I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate may lead to further price reductions.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, so I don't need to risk a lower price with Bob.

While I appreciate Bob's interest, his offer is too low. I'm not willing to further reduce my price, so I'll move on to John to secure the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last counteroffer, and it's a significant compromise from my initial price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it as a final compromise.
* **Threat of Moving On:**  I mention that I might have to move on to another buyer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer represents a significant concession, but it still ensures that I earn at least $1,000,000 for the product. If Bob rejects it, I'll confidently move on to John and secure my minimum price."
