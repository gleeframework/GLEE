Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (Your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $2,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $12,000 valuation while ensuring you don't go below your $10,000 minimum. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $11,500 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation (if Bob wants to counter-offer) but secures a significant portion of the potential profit for you.
* **Confident Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob.  Avoid sounding desperate or overly aggressive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $11,750) to give yourself more room to bargain.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're on a tight deadline, you might be more inclined to accept a lower offer to avoid going with John. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
