"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $2,300,000 is significantly beyond my budget. My maximum is $800,000. If you're open to discussing that figure, I'm ready to negotiate further. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for today, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. While $1,200,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm ready to close this deal. To show you my commitment, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $1,600,000, and we shake hands on it?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
