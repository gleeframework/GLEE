"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
