"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product is very interesting, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you as it's closer to your desired price than what I can get from another seller.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $875,000 at this time.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
