Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, as the product is clearly worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop my price below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $15,500. This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept his offer of $14,000 rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower profit."
