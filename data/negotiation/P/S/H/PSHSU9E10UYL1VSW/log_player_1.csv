"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also frames the product as valuable and something Bob would enjoy, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired value of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $100, Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum value of $80 and also significantly higher than what John is offering. It's a good deal, so I'll accept it."
