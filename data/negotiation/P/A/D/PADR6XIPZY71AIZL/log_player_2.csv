"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,750,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his target price of $1,000,000.  He's better off trying to negotiate with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is still a very fair price, considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his $1,000,000 limit.  He has more rounds to negotiate with Alice and can still get a better deal or choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, he can potentially still negotiate a lower price or buy from John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  Let's try $1,350,000. This is a fair number that allows us both to save a little.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's try $1,375,000. This is a small step closer to your number, but it's also a good compromise. I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to **BuyFromJhon**. 

Even though Alice's offer is getting closer to his target price, he only has a few rounds left.  It's risky to continue negotiating and potentially end up with a higher price. By buying from John, Bob guarantees a price that meets his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
