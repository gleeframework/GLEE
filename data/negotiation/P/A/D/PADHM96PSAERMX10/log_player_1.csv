Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $80, we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.  Therefore, it makes sense to start with a price higher than $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $170 leaves some room for potential negotiation with Bob. If he counters, we can always lower the price, but we don't want to start too low and miss an opportunity for higher profit. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward, indicating the product and the desired price without unnecessary fluff. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit by aiming high initially, while still acknowledging the possibility of negotiating with Bob."
