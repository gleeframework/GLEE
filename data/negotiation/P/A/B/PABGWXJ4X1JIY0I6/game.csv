"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents a fair valuation considering its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a good balance between value and investment for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your price point, but I have to be honest, going below $1,200,000 would be cutting into the true worth of this product. That's my absolute floor, and I'm firm on that. If you're able to meet that, we have a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
