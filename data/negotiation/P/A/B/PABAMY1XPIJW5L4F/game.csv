"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, while allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
