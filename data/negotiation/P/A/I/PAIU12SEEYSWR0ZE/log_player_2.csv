Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows Alice's minimum is likely around $10,000, so he starts by offering slightly above that. This gives him room to negotiate further if Alice counteroffers."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's not enough for Bob. While he's nearing his limit, the offer is still $250 above his initial counteroffer. Bob should keep negotiating, as he has several rounds left to try and get the price even lower."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob is steadily closing the gap with Alice, and he knows time is running out.  He's offering $12,000, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows his commitment to finding a compromise, but it's also close to his upper limit. If Alice rejects this, he may have to consider buying from John in the later rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still too high for Bob. He only has a few rounds left before he has to consider buying from John.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming to get the price closer to his target of $12,000. He's demonstrated his commitment to finding a compromise, and Alice seems to be responding, so there's still hope for a favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit and knows that time is running out. He's offering $12,500, which is a significant increase from his previous offer but still within his budget. This counteroffer shows his commitment to finding a solution while also acknowledging the limited time remaining. If Alice rejects this, Bob will have to seriously consider buying from John in the next round."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time. He has only one round left to negotiate with Alice, and her latest offer is still too high.  He has been consistently trying to negotiate a lower price, but it's clear Alice is unwilling to go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000. This ensures he gets the product, even if it means paying more than he initially hoped. While it's not his ideal scenario, it's the best option given the circumstances."
