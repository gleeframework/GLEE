"I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price reduction to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? I think that's a fair price for this high-quality product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider a price reduction to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, $9000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10500? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to consider a price reduction to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,
