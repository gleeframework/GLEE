"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value to me while also giving you a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests. Let me know if this works for you!",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,075,000 is still a little steep for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,060,000. This price is still within my budget, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product. Let's work together to make this happen.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm counteroffering at $1,090,000, but I'm only willing to go this low because I think we can both benefit from this deal. If you're still not comfortable, I'll have to consider other options.",1090000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, $1,090,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to think about my own interests. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,100,000 is already the lowest I can go, but I'll meet you halfway between that and your last offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,087,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal here.",1087500.0,Alice,9,

This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I see in the product.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I hope you'll accept.
