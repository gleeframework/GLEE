"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you value it at $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have John as a backup option to buy the product for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially lower her price further. You're not losing anything by rejecting this offer, and you might save an additional $500."
