* **Negotiation is worth pursuing:** You have room to negotiate a better price, potentially saving more than $10.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always go to John if negotiations fail, ensuring you get the product."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:** This counteroffer is halfway between your ideal price ($80) and Alice's initial offer ($110). 
* **Room for compromise:** It gives Alice some room to negotiate while still offering you a significant discount.
* **Early compromise:**  Starting with a moderate counteroffer might encourage Alice to be more flexible in future rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice's offer has reverted back to her original price, indicating a potential impasse.
* **Limited Time:** With only three rounds remaining, the likelihood of a successful negotiation is decreasing.
