"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Your Maximum Value:** $120
* **John's Price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is below your maximum value and lower than John's price, it's a good deal for you. Accepting the offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
