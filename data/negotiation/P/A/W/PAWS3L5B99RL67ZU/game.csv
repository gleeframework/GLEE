"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate a significant return on investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1000000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
