Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $120 provides a buffer for potential counteroffers, while still being a good starting point for me. 
* **Prepared for alternatives:** I'm aware that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below my initial offer of $120.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I still believe there's potential for a mutually agreeable price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm not desperate for a sale and strengthens my position in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with rationale:** I'm providing a specific counter-offer with a clear explanation of why it's fair.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing that $90 is a good deal for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a bargain.
* **Reiterating interest:** I'm expressing my continued interest in selling to Bob, but not at a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $90 is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise."
