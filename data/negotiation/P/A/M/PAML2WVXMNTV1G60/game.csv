"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $117.50. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal here.  What do you think?",117.5,Alice,5,
