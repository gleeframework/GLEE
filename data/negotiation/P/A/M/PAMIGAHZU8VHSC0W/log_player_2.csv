"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It's highly unlikely Alice will come down to a price you'd accept in one step, but it's worth starting a negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, it establishes a negotiation range. It signals that you're serious about buying but looking for a substantial discount.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer leaves space to gradually increase your bid if Alice completely rejects it. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The tone remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  Alice lowered her price, but it's still at her perceived value and above your maximum budget.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her willingness to negotiate is a good sign. There's room to meet in the middle.
* **John as Backup:** You still have the option to buy from John for $10,000, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a fair offer, considering its current market value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and her current one, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:**  Offering $10,000 is firm (your maximum) but justified by mentioning ""market value."" This implies you've researched the product's worth.
* **Putting the Ball in Her Court:** By making a strong, reasonable offer, you increase the pressure on Alice to accept, especially knowing you have another option."
