"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a good starting point, knowing Bob values the product at $120.
* **Not too aggressive:**  $100 leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I want to keep the tone friendly and build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by much. This indicates I'm serious about selling to Bob but still value the product. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I emphasize ""good deal for both of us"" to highlight a potential win-win situation.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I continue to be friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:**  $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than I'd like. I want to see if I can push a bit further. 
* **Maintaining negotiating leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the pressure on him. 
* **Time is a factor:**  I'm aware that rounds are limited, but I believe a slightly higher price is attainable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $85.  How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not give in completely.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Again, I emphasize a fair price for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing in on the deal:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for potential compromise in the next round."
