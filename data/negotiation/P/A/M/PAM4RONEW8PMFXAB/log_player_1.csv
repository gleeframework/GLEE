"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if I can get a quick deal. It leaves room for negotiation if necessary, but also shows I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my desired range. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by counter-offering. I'm also confident that I can potentially get closer to my goal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to drop my price too drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now very close to my desired price point. Given that this is round 4, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price, it's more strategically sound to accept and secure the deal.  Further negotiation could risk losing Bob altogether, and the $10,000 offer from John is a good safety net, but it's significantly lower than this offer."
