Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $120 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $80 = $70) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150 - $120 = $30).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing the Sale:**  The price is attractive enough to entice Bob to accept.
* **Maximizing Your Profit:** You are aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
