Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?

```
