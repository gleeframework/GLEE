"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice has stated the product is ""unique"" and ""rare"" which suggests it might be worth more than $900,000. There's room for a counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it.  I'm serious about buying this product, but need to be sure the price is right for me."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down much further. Buying from John would cost me $1,500,000, so this is a much better deal.  Accepting Alice's offer saves me $750,000 compared to buying from John."
