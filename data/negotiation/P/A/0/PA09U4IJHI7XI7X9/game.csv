"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $92 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $88?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $90? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin.",90.0,Alice,5,
