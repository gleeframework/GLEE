"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I'm aiming for a profit. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I believe he'll be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant decrease from my initial price, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for further compromise while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer but still maintains my minimum profit margin. Since I'm only halfway through the rounds, I believe this will keep the negotiations going and potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,200,000, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price point.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an acceptable deal is increasing. To guarantee a profit, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000."
