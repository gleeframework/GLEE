"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm not able to go that low yet. How about $950000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. How about we meet at $920000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $935000.  This is a significant value for you, and it's a price I can realistically accept.  What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
