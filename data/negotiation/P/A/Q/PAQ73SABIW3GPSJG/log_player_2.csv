"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to us and your anticipated appreciation, I propose selling it to you for $12,000. This offer takes into account the product's worth to both parties and aims to achieve a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range. If not, you're still secure in buying from John at a much lower price."
