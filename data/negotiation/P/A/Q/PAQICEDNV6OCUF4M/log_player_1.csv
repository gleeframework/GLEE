Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. I'm confident this is a good starting point for our negotiations.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to offer $975000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.
