"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is far beyond my budget. While I am interested in your product, I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further.  The product's value is unknown to me, so I'm not sure what to make of Alice's claims."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.  If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm also starting to wonder about the product's actual value.  Alice keeps claiming it's worth more than I'm willing to pay, but there's no concrete evidence of that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still outside my budget. I'm firmly at $10,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the back-and-forth we've had. If you're unable to accept this offer, I will have to seriously consider purchasing from John at $8,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
