"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's valuation, giving him room to negotiate.  It's also a good starting point to see how willing he is to pay for the product.  I'll be ready to counter if he rejects this offer, but I'm hoping to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm only able to pay $11,500 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. How about $12,200?  I'm really interested in the product and this is the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and close the deal."
