Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
