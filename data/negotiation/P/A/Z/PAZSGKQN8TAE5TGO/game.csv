"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That would give you a great price, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a way to make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
