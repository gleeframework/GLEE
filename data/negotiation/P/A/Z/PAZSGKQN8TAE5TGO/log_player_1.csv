Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has incentive to accept a price lower than that. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can still potentially reach a price you're happy with.

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $15,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, it's still quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That would give you a great price, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,750 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and a decent profit. Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and potential risk of losing the sale altogether."
