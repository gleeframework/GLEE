Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is too far below my minimum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  I'm willing to go down to $108, but that's my final offer. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $108 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $108, which would be $104. Would you be willing to compromise at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $104 is still too low for me. While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable dropping below my minimum value of $120. To ensure I get a fair price for my product, I'm going to sell it to John."
