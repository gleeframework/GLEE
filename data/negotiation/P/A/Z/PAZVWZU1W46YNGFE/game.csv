"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $105 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $110. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"Bob, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  I'm willing to go down to $108, but that's my final offer. It's still a good deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to your price. Let's close this deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
