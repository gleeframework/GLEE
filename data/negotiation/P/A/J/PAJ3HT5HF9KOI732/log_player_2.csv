"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price or, if unsuccessful, buy from John for a guaranteed $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best deal possible. Offering $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing a strong desire to purchase the product. This price is also within Bob's budget, while still leaving some room for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate further, there's also a risk of Alice rejecting another offer and pushing the price even higher.  Since John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, it's the most financially sound decision to buy from John."
