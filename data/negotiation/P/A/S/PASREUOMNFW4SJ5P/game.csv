"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for both of us.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum, as I have another option for acquiring the product at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I'm confident you won't find this level of quality and potential elsewhere.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,800,000 is still a bit out of my price range, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant step for me, and I truly believe this product is worth it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen. I'm prepared to accept $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer at this price. It's a win-win opportunity for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
