# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose an offer of $14,000 for the product. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also includes some exclusive benefits tailored for you. I assure you, this investment will yield significant returns on your expectations. Please let me know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $14,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $15,000.** 
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000.**

While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's likely that she won't go lower than $12,000 (her minimum).  Therefore, accepting her offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
