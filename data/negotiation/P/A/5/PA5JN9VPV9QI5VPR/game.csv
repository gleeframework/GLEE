"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a little higher than I had in mind. Could you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
