"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
