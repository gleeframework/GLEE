"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking for $120 for it. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, and I think you'll really get a lot of use out of it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120, I still believe I can get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and push for a lower price closer to my $100 counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price of $120.  While I'd prefer $105, it's not worth risking losing the product and having to buy from John at a higher price. I'll accept Alice's offer."
