"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point there.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,037,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
