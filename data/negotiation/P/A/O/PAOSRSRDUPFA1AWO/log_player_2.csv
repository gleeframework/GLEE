"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better deal than John's $1,000,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that number?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still closer to his ideal price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can find a meeting point there."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,037,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has two options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This gets him the product for $1,037,500, which is a good deal considering he's aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.
2. **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks Alice becoming less flexible, and there's no guarantee of a better deal in the following rounds.  Also, buying from John would only save him $37,500. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most logical and strategic decision in this situation."
