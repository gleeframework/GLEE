"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to do $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's right at my budget."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's still a great price for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and higher than my counteroffer, making it a fair deal.  Accepting this offer saves me $3 compared to buying from John."
