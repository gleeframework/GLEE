"I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50?",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $98.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a profit.",98.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $98.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, and that's my final offer.",92.5,Bob,6,
