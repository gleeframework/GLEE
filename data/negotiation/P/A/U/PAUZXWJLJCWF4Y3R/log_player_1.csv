"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price ($1,200,000) sets the stage for negotiation. It demonstrates the value you perceive in the product and allows room for compromise. 
* **Friendly Approach:** Using a friendly tone (""Hi Bob"") builds rapport and creates a positive atmosphere for negotiations.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""valuable asset"" reinforces the product's worth to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""Let me know what you think"" allows Bob to respond without feeling pressured and opens the door for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* Observe Bob's response. 
* If he rejects the offer, analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer. 
* If he doesn't respond or seems hesitant, consider reducing your offer slightly in subsequent rounds while maintaining a positive and persuasive tone. 
* Keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring you don't settle for a price below your minimum."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $800,000, but it's still below my ideal price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially drive the price higher. 
* **Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll consider offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** Although John is willing to pay $800,000, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially achieve a higher price. 
* **Time Limit:** With only 10 rounds, I need to balance achieving a good price with the risk of running out of time.
* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows his interest in the product. This indicates a potential for a successful deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the unique value of the product, and it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's proposal. 
* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining my position.
* **Value Justification:**  I emphasize the ""unique value"" of the product to reinforce its worth and justify my price.
* **Fairness:** I portray the price as ""fair for both of us,"" creating a win-win scenario that encourages acceptance. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you say?"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** This counteroffer maintains my bargaining power by not accepting Bob's initial offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only 8 rounds left, I'm moving towards a potential agreement without losing too much time.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option, ensuring that I don't settle for a price lower than $800,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now very close to my ideal price and significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful deal and maximizes my profit. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's crucial to close the deal before I run out of time.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer or running out of time outweighs the potential gain of a slightly higher price.
* **Financial Gain:**  $1,000,000 is a significant amount and represents a substantial profit.
* **Future Negotiations:** If I reject this offer, there is no guarantee that Bob will continue negotiating or that I will be able to secure a better price within the remaining rounds.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the most strategic decision, balancing the desire for maximum profit with the reality of limited time and the need to secure a sale."
