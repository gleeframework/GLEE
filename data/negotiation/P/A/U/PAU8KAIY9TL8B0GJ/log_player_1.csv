Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **First-mover Advantage:** Highlighting that Bob has the first chance creates a sense of urgency and potential exclusivity, which might encourage him to accept the higher price."
