"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,
