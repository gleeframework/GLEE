"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $900000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $825000. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm glad we're able to find some common ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway, just like you did. I'm now offering the product to you for $800000. I think this price is fair, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",800000.0,Alice,5,
