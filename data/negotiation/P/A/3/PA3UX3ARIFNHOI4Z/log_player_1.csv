Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of John's offer ($80), so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious in your initial ask to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at a lower price of $95. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent offer, we started high for a reason.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $105 keeps the price significantly above your minimum ($80) and splits the difference between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  By not dropping too much, you maintain the perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $100 is a $20 profit over your minimum acceptable price. That's a good return.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Bob and risk him walking away. The potential gain from further negotiation is likely small. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures you get paid promptly."
