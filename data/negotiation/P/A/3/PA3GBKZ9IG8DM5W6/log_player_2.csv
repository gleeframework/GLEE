"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and it's worth more than $1,500,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? This still represents a significant value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This represents a substantial saving for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,337,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,312,500. This would allow me to acquire the product while ensuring you also get a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1312500}
```
