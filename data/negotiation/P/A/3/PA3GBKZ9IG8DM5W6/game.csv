"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and it's worth more than $1,500,000 to you! Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,300,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? This still represents a significant value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This represents a substantial saving for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,337,500. This is a fair price that gives you a significant savings, while still allowing me to get closer to my target. Let me know what you think.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,337,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,312,500. This would allow me to acquire the product while ensuring you also get a good deal.  What do you think?",1312500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $1,325,000. This is a very fair price, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
