"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love.  I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $60 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $78? That's my final offer.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $78 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm still willing to compromise, though.  How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to close this deal without further delays.  What do you say?",82.0,Alice,7,
