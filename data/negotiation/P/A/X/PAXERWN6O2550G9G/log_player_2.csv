Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $60 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?

You have three options:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $78 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm still willing to compromise, though.  How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to close this deal without further delays.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $82 is close to your $80 limit, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You've tried negotiating with Alice, but she seems unlikely to go below $82. At this point, cutting your losses and securing the product from John at your target price is the most logical decision."
