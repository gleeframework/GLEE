Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John. This strategy balances risk and potential reward."
