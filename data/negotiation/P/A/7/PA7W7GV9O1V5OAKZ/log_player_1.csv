Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:**  While this offer aims to maximize your profit, it's important to consider how Bob might perceive it.  A very high offer might discourage him from negotiating at all.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in mind."
