Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

You should reject Alice's offer. Although she came down a bit, it's still above your target price. You're very close to John's price of $120, and there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
