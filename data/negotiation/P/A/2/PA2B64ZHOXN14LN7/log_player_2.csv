"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he wants to save as much as possible.  He'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both find a win-win here."", ""product_price"": 16000}
