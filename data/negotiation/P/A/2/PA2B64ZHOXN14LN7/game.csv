"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500? ",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both find a win-win here.",16000.0,Bob,4,
