Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both find a win-win here.
