"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm willing to let it go for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $110 is still above your $80 maximum. You can do better by rejecting her offer and going with John's $80 price."
