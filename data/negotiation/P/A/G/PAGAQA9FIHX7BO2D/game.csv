"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about we settle at $975,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $1,062,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1062500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that price is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000 even? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one final concession to $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
