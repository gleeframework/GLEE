"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1050000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1050000 doesn't quite cover the true value of this product and the resources I've invested in it. I'm prepared to come down to $1100000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
