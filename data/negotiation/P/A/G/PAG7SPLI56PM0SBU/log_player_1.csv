"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is high, but I'm starting strong. I know Bob's willing to pay up to $800,000, so I have room to negotiate. By starting high, I create a sense of urgency and also leave room to potentially accept a counteroffer that still benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's a win-win for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,000,000. This is my floor price, and I'm still making a profit.  I'm highlighting the ""win-win"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept, and I'm also reminding him of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $950,000 is a good price, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to risk another round and potentially end up with a lower offer or having to sell to John."
