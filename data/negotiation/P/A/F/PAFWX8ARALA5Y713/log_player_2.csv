"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm confident that you'll see the potential in it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is better than her initial offer, but it's still above Bob's preferred price point. He should continue to negotiate to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make another slight concession to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a better price. While Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is closer to his target, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. He's also aware that he has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so he doesn't need to accept Alice's offer unless it's truly a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're feeling the pressure, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,105,000. This is a fair offer considering our negotiation history and the fact that I'm willing to pay a premium above John's price. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1105000}
