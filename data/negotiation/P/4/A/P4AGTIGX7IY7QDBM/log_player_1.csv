Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can always come down a bit, still staying above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** A higher initial offer helps you understand Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. If he rejects, you can adjust and still secure a good deal."
