"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $8,600, which is closer to our target price. This would be a good deal for both of us, as we'd both be getting a fair price.  What do you think?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $8,700, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
