Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 allows for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Maintain a Professional Tone:**  The message is polite and emphasizes the product's value, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer seriously.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases the chances of closing the deal at a price significantly higher than John's offer."
