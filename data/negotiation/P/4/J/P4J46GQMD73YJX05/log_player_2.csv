"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice's offer of $10,800 is getting closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if he can get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  That seems fair to us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,700. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,700 is closer to his target than John's price of $12,000, there's still a chance to get it for even less. It's worth seeing if he can get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,650, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has only three rounds left.  He's already managed to negotiate a price significantly lower than John's offering.  Alice has stated she won't go lower than $10,650, so it's highly likely that continuing to negotiate will either result in no deal or force Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to get the product at a good price within the remaining rounds."
