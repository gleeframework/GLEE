"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
