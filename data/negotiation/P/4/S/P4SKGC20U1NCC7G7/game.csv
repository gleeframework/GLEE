"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This is a significant discount and demonstrates my serious interest in this deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price. However, $1,020,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $980,000 for the product.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement in these final rounds.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,000,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $990,000 for the product. This is a very small difference from your offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our limited time.  Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,8,
