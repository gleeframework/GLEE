Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,000,000 minimum. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and take the guaranteed profit."
