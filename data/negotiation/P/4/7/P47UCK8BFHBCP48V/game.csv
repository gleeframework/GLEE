"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to me and your bottom line.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
