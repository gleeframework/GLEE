Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no reason to offer the product to Bob for less than that.  You might get lucky and Bob might accept the $150 price even though it's worth less to him. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to factor in the time it might take to find another buyer if Bob rejects the offer. If time is a significant factor, you might adjust the price slightly lower to increase the chances of a quicker sale."
