"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing my belief that Bob will value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price. I believe the product is worth more than $85 to Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm trying to be reasonable by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer. I'm also reiterating my belief in the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we try $88? It's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I'm confident that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm going to try to push for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference this time and go with $90. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my target and still reasonable for Bob. I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling like we're getting close.  Would you be willing to do $89?  That's a really good offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $89 is still a little below my target, it's very close and I've only got 4 rounds left. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
