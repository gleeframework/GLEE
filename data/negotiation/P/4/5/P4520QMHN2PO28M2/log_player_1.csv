Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a high price, reflecting the product's value to you. However, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still being significantly more attractive than your guaranteed sale price."
