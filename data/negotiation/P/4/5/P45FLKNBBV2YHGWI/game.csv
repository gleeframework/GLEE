"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget constraint and need to be mindful of that. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
