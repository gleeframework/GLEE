"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for $150. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget for this product is $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has clearly stated his maximum budget is $120, which is your minimum acceptable price. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a better offer from him.  It's best to take the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk Bob not budging and potentially getting stuck with a worse outcome after further rounds."
