The product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

You can likely still get the product for closer to your $10,000 limit.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best approach."

You are very close to your maximum price! One more round of counter-offering is worth it. You can likely get Alice down to $10,000 or very close to it."

Alice is now offering the product at $10,200, which is only $200 over your maximum price. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that you'll be unable to get a better price. At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal to another buyer."
