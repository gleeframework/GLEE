"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $1,075,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a good deal on your end.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming back with a revised price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and the market rate.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but I need you to be realistic about the value here. $950,000 is too low.  My final offer is $1,025,000. If you're unable to meet this price, I'm afraid I'll have to pursue other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
