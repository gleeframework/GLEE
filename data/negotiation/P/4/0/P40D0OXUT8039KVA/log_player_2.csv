**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $900,000. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $875,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
