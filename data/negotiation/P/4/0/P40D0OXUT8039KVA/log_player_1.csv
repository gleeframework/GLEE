{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which can create a positive environment for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm committed to $850,000, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $850,000 offer, and while it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already counter-offered and feel it's unlikely he'll budge further.  Therefore, it's best to sell to John for $1,000,000 and secure my desired value."
