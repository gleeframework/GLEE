{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $108, but that's as low as I can go.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still trying to save money, and you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $108 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 106}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $106, Bob. I can do $112, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has raised her price, which is a sign she might be willing to negotiate further.  It's still worth trying to get a better price, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're feeling frustrated, but I'm still very interested in your product. $112 is still a little high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $109. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to meet in the middle at $109, Bob. I think you're getting a good deal at $110. It's a fair price for the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come back to her original offer of $110. While you'd prefer to pay less, it's unlikely you'll get a better price from Alice. Buying from John would cost you $120, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this round."
