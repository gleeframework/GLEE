{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It positions the price as a potential bargain compared to what John is willing to pay.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob's perceived value of $800,000 is acknowledged, but the offer highlights the potential for him to gain more than his initial assessment. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a profitable deal with Bob and ensuring I don't leave money on the table by accepting John's offer prematurely."
