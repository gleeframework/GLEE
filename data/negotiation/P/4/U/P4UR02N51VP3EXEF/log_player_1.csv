Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling like I'm losing too much. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations or going with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this would leave me with a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counter with a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 with John.  I will only accept an offer from Bob that comes closer to this amount.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is more in line with my minimum, and I will be prepared to walk away if he continues to offer significantly lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the door open for a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,000,000, the product is a great value for him.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to counter again or move on to John's offer. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a deal that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay that much for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** There is very little room left for further negotiation.  Any counteroffers will likely result in further rejections. 
* **Guaranteed Offer:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiations that might end with a lower price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept John's offer and close the deal, as it provides the best possible outcome for me."
