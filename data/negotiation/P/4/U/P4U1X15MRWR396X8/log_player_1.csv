Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, leaving a small margin ($1,000) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net, increasing the likelihood of a profitable outcome for Alice."
