"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $140 would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",155.0,Alice,5,
