"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  ",10000.0,Alice,5,
