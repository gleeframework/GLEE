"Alice, thanks for presenting your product. While it does sound intriguing, the price point you're offering doesn't quite align with my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $800,000. It's a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations.  I'd be willing to go as high as $700,000, but I need to see some movement from your side to make this deal work.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, that last offer is getting closer to something we could both agree on. To bridge the remaining gap, I'd be willing to offer $725,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value to me.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to try to reach an agreement. I'm now offering the product to you for $725,001. This is a very slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm trying to find a middle ground.",725001.0,Alice,7,
