"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible and he's willing to pay no more than $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your range.  How about we consider $1,000,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. He's willing to pay no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  You've stated $900,000 is your final offer, and I want to be respectful of your position.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a very fair deal. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has come down to $975,000, Bob's goal is to spend no more than $800,000.  Since he has the option to buy the product from John for that price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at the lower price."
