"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value will far exceed that price. I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential benefits this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1900000 is a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1700000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand your perspective, $1700000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1850000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the potential of this product.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about other options. I'm willing to meet you at $1750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the potential of the product.",1750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1750000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1800000, which is a fair compromise considering the potential of this product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you don't accept, I'll need to explore other options.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I've given you a good amount of wiggle room, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
