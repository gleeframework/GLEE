Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product at $140, you are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  It's well above your minimum selling price and John's offer. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer enticing for Bob."
