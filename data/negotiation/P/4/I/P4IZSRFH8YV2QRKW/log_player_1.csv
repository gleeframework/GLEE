I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 with John.  This strategy is based on the following:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I'm aiming for the best possible outcome.  There's a chance Bob values the product more than $1,500,000 and will accept.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John, ensuring I still make a substantial profit.

It's a calculated risk, but it gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings."
