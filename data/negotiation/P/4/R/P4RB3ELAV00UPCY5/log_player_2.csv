"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly find a middle ground.  He's offering a price that's $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, which is a substantial difference but still within his budget. This strategy aims to encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While this product is worth a significant investment, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save more money. While Alice has come down in price, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt one more counteroffer before potentially resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still looking for a better deal, though.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's halfway between his last offer and Alice's current offer.  This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.  He's hoping that Alice will accept this counteroffer, as it is likely close to her bottom line."
