Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My goal:**  I want to maximize my profit. Since I can sell to John for $15,000, I want to get as close to that price as possible.
* **Bob's perspective:**  Bob values the product at $12,000. I'm offering it at $14,000.  He's likely to consider it, but it's a bit of a stretch for him. 
* **Potential Outcome:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for a higher price, guaranteeing a profit of $15,000.  If Bob accepts, I get a lower profit but still make $1,000 more than if I sold to John. 

By offering $14,000, I'm striking a balance between getting a good price and not risking losing Bob as a buyer."
