"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

We'll start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $11,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

We're splitting the difference between our last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, but we can still try to push for a slightly better deal. We'll make one more counteroffer before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're really making this a tough decision! I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  That's my final offer.  I think it's a very fair price considering the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 12250
}
``` 

We're getting close to our limit and to what seems like a reasonable compromise.  By stating this is our final offer, we signal that we're serious and encourage Alice to accept."
