"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is below my minimum price. I could be flexible if we can find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,200,000.  To avoid losing the deal altogether, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,237,500. Can you consider this offer?",1237500.0,Bob,6,
