"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $11,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, you have room to negotiate.  It's worth a few rounds of counteroffers to see if you can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're still within the 10 rounds, and there's room for further negotiation. It's worth a couple more rounds to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $10,875. I think that's a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about $11,375? It's a bit more than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above what you're willing to pay. Although you're getting closer to your target price, you have some rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal, but $11,375 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's try $11,125.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's the best way to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $11,125. How about $11,250? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight increase from her previous offer, it's still above your desired price point. You only have three rounds remaining, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better price. It's worth one more round of counter-offers to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $11,187.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 11187.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,187.50, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. Alice's offer of $11,250 is still slightly above your desired price. While you could reject and try another counteroffer, there's no guarantee she'll come down further, and you could risk not reaching an agreement. 

Given that you only have one round left, it's more strategic to accept John's offer of $12,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice."
