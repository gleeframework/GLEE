"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000  to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget ($14,000 vs. your $8,000 limit).  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Realistic Range:** My offer is within the range of my budget, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear Statement:** I've stated that this is my best offer, setting a firm point for Alice to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. There's still room for improvement before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:** I'm raising my offer by $1,000 from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" aspect of my offer, aligning it with the product's value to avoid appearing too lowball.
* **Budget Reminder:** I reiterate my budget constraint to remind Alice that I'm operating within a realistic limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you seem to recognize the value of this product. I'm ready to make a significant move to seal the deal. How about $10,500?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my target price of $8,000. 
* **Final Offer?**  Alice claims this is her final offer, but it's unlikely she'll completely walk away. I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Alice might accept a slightly higher counteroffer.  At this point, buying from John seems like a safer bet, but there's still room for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  Let's try to close this deal, as it seems we are close."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm raising my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount ($300). This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while staying within my budget.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I emphasize the closeness of our positions, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Alice to compromise.
* **Final Push:**  I'm approaching my maximum, but leaving room for a slight concession if Alice is willing to meet in the middle."
