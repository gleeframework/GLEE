Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  Let's try to close this deal, as it seems we are close. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he will reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
