"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is cheaper than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  

Here's why:

* **Alice's motivation:** Alice values the product at $8,000.  She's willing to sell for $10,000, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **Bob's goal:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to try to get a lower price. 

By counteroffering, Bob can potentially secure the product for less than $10,000, which would be a better outcome than accepting Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but it's still above Alice's valuation of $8,000. This gives Alice a good reason to consider the offer while still allowing Bob to potentially save more money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $9,500.  Here's why:

* **Better than John:** $9,500 is significantly cheaper than John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price.  There's also the risk that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer of $9,500 is the best option for Bob, as it ensures a good price while minimizing risk."
