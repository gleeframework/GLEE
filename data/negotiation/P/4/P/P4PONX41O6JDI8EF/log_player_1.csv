"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This establishes a high anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price, even though we haven't specified what the product is. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price allows room for me to make concessions throughout the 10 rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, considering my own valuation. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to maximize my profit, accepting such a low offer would result in a significant loss.  It's time to counter-offer and see if we can find a more agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I'm making a substantial reduction of $300,000 from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Valuation:**  While the new offer is still significantly above both my minimum and Bob's stated maximum, it keeps the price anchored in a higher range. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's ""true potential and worth"" to counter Bob's low valuation. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message highlights this counter-offer as a step towards a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" I'm hoping this encourages Bob to significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased substantially to $1,000,000, but it's still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  While his willingness to negotiate is a positive sign, I need to hold firm and see if I can guide him closer to my target range.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're making progress. I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $300,000, which is a significant amount. This signals to Bob that I'm flexible and serious about reaching an agreement.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Tactic:** By framing the offer as ""meeting halfway,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a price point closer to my target. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm making concessions, I'm still well above my minimum of $1,500,000 and have left some room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Limited Time:** We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. I need to guide Bob towards a more acceptable offer soon or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to recoup a good price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering we're both trying to meet in the middle. I'm confident that this product will be profitable for you at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer but is still below my $1,500,000 minimum. I cannot accept a loss.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's increments suggest he might be willing to go higher. I need to incentivize him to do so. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are getting closer to the end of the rounds, and I need to apply more pressure or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price given the product's value. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my last offer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight Concession, Strong Stance:** I've come down slightly from my $1,500,000 minimum, signaling some flexibility, but not too much. 
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price.
* **Pressure to Close:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm putting the ball in Bob's court and encouraging him to make a decision. He now knows I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't accept.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer of $1,500,000. At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation with Bob isn't worth the risk of losing both offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's final offer of $1,300,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes no financial sense to accept a lower offer from Bob.
* **Time is Up:** We're running out of rounds, and Bob has stated his final offer. It's highly unlikely he'll increase it to an acceptable amount. 

It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
