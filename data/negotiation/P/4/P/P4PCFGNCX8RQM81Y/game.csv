"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Based on my research, I believe the product's value is around $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, my assessment aligns more closely with the initial figure I presented. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of this unique product.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, but I need to see some flexibility from your side.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but your offer is simply too far from where I see the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more significant move to demonstrate my commitment to finding an agreement. Let's settle at $1,850,000. This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it fairly reflects the unique benefits this product offers.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,850,000. I'm willing to make a significant counteroffer, but I need to see some more flexibility from your side. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think this is the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a way to work together.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're both clearly invested in reaching a deal here. Your offer is the most reasonable one yet, and I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair agreement for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it. I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
