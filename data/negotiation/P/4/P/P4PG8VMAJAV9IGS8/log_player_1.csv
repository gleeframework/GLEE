Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to start with an offer significantly higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly sought after. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage a quicker decision from Bob.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:** While not explicitly stating the benefits in this message, the language hints at the value Bob will receive. In further interactions, Alice should highlight how the product solves Bob's problems and is worth the investment. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  However, her bottom line is $15,000 since she has a guaranteed buyer at that price."
