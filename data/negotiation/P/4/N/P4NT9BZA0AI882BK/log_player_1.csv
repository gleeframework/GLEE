Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is designed to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. By offering a price lower than my minimum, I increase the chances of Bob accepting. If he rejects, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer. 

It's important to note that this is just the first offer. I'll continue to analyze the situation and adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum value of $120, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Time constraint:** I'm not under immediate pressure to sell, so I can afford to continue negotiating. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum value, but I'm hoping to earn more.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to compromise. I'm also trying to frame it as a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a compromise:** This approach aims to find a middle ground and move the negotiation forward. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum value of $120, which is important to me.
* **Signaling flexibility:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Let's try $92 as a compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $92 is only $8 away from my minimum value of $120.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially losing a sale and ending up with nothing.
* **Limited time:** By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and move on, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing both Bob and John.

While I might be able to secure a slightly higher price through further negotiation, the risk of losing both potential buyers outweighs the potential gain."
