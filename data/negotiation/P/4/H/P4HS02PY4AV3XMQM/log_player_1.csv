{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Is lower than your minimum value:** You still have room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Provides a clear and concise message:**  It clearly states the offer and invites Bob to respond. 

This offer sets up the negotiation in your favor while still being reasonable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal you won't want to miss. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $875,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. I will counter with a price closer to my desired amount."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $890,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, it seems like Bob is not willing to go any higher. To ensure I get the best possible price, I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees my minimum value and avoids further negotiations that might not yield a better outcome."
