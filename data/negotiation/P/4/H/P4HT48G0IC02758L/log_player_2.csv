"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  There's still room for negotiation with Alice, and Bob has a backup option with John at $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, considering Bob's backup option with John for $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal, especially considering John's price of $1,000,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or Alice getting more stubborn is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
