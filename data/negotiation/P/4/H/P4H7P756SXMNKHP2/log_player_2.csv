Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and I only have three rounds left. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with no deal. I'll buy the product from John for $120."
