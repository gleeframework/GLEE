This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation, making it appealing but not overly generous. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will try to negotiate further with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's getting close, but I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement. I don't want to risk getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation. John is a reliable buyer, and I'm comfortable selling to him."
