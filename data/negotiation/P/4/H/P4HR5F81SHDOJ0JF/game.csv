"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $160. It's a great price for a product like this, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for a product like this.",155.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $145?",145.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, but I'm willing to throw in a special bonus package that includes some exclusive content to sweeten the deal. I think this will make it worth your while to meet me at $150.",150.0,Alice,7,
