"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, so let me know soon! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
