Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1800000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm ready to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the value you place on the product.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a stance that is closer to your desired price.
* **Reasoning:** The message highlights the value of the product to both parties, offering a compromise that still allows for a reasonable profit for Alice.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me at $1400000, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1550000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget, but you can still try to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better price in the next round. While buying from John for $1,500,000 is an option, it's worth exploring if you can get a slightly lower price from Alice, especially since you have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're definitely making progress. I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,525,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this purchase.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that you're willing to compromise, but still maintain a price that's closer to your maximum budget.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1525500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $25,500 lower than your maximum budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, we have very few rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
