"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit high for you, but $1,200,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. However, I can do a bit better than that. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,650,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,350,000 is getting a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
