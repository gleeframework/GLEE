Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, I am serious about the product.  However, $15,500 is just too far out of my price range.  I can offer you $12,000, which is the most I'm willing to pay.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $12,000.  It's not worth risking losing the $15,000 offer from John."
