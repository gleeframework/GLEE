"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product.  Let's try to wrap this up. How about $15,500?  That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am serious about the product.  However, $15,500 is just too far out of my price range.  I can offer you $12,000, which is the most I'm willing to pay.  Take it or leave it.",12000.0,Bob,6,
