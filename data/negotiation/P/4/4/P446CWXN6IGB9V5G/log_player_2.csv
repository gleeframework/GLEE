"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is under your $15,000 limit, you can likely negotiate a better price. John's offer acts as a price ceiling, meaning you know you can get the product for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential counter-offers and a chance to save more money."
