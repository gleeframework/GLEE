"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but gives him room to negotiate. This also sets the stage for potential counteroffers and allows me to gauge his interest. 

**Strategy:**

* **High Starting Point:**  A high starting point allows for more room to negotiate down without feeling like I'm losing too much.
* **Test the Waters:**  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product. If he rejects this offer, it will give me a better understanding of his willingness to pay.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm using John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net, knowing I can always walk away and get that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I want to leverage this. There's a chance I can get a better price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a solid fallback, I'm not in a rush. I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, likely in the range of $1,500,000 to $1,600,000. This will allow me to assess Bob's commitment and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our positions. It shows I'm serious about negotiating but am not willing to drastically lower my price. 
* **Assessing Bob's Commitment:** By counteroffering with a price that's still within my target range, I can assess Bob's true desire for the product and his willingness to meet me halfway. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's offer, I still maintain some leverage by being above his last offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Based on Bob's response to this counteroffer, I'll adjust my strategy for the following rounds. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or potentially take John's offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price in the next round. Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer, so there's room for improvement.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm not yet desperate. I have time and can afford to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, likely somewhere between $1,450,000 and $1,550,000. This counteroffer should show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but not willing to go lower than my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is my final stand before considering John's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** This counteroffer signals to Bob that I'm serious about getting at least $1,500,000 for the product. 
* **John's Offer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will be ready to accept John's offer and ensure I don't lose any further value.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to either accept Bob's next offer (if it's at least $1,500,000) or take John's offer, which guarantees my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've reached a point where it's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with him. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Low Value:**  Bob's offer is too low to justify further negotiations, especially considering the limited rounds left.
* **Guarantee:** John's offer guarantees my desired price and eliminates the risk of further rounds of potentially unproductive negotiations with Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  With only 4 rounds left, I can't afford to waste time on a deal that's unlikely to reach my desired price.

**Conclusion:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum acceptable price and avoid further potential losses in negotiation."
