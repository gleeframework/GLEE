"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $13,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13800. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,800 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **A slight compromise is acceptable:** Bob's initial counteroffer was $13,500, and Alice met him halfway at $13,800. This shows a willingness to negotiate, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **The product is valuable:** The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, indicating it has value.  It's likely that Bob would be able to use the product effectively, justifying the investment.

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, accepting the offer at $13,800 secures the product for a price he can afford and ensures a successful transaction."
