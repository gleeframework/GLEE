Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, I've reached my limit.  It's better to buy the product from John and save $350,000."
