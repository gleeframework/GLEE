"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $85?  "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, which is a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. However, you are still willing to pay up to $100 for the product, so there's still room for further negotiation. You can try a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
