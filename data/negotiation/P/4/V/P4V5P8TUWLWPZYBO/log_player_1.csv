Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below what I know the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. This also allows me to gauge his interest without immediately offering the lowest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $85?   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale at $87.50 rather than risking getting only $80 from John."
