"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his limit. 
* Continuing to negotiate risks getting stuck in a back-and-forth without reaching a deal, potentially leading Bob to buy from John at $1,200,000.
*  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,350,000 secures the product and allows Bob to save $50,000 compared to buying from John."
