"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) and slightly higher than what I think the product is worth to Bob ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By setting an initial high price, I create space for negotiation without immediately cutting into my profit margin.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and positive to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and also below what I believe the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.  
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Language:** The message stays positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, suggesting that we can still find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's closer, I'm not yet ready to accept a price that leaves me with such a small profit margin.
* **Potential for higher counter:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not in a rush to accept a deal that's significantly below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm willing to go down to $115. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's last offer ($110) and my previous offer ($125), showing that I'm actively seeking a middle ground.
* **Small Concession:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a small enough concession to show flexibility while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Confidence and Closure:** The message expresses confidence in reaching a deal, aiming to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
