{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. This is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Openness:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which is important to keep the negotiation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Knowledge:** I don't know how much Bob values the product, so this price is a starting point.  I need to be prepared to adjust based on his response.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm always aware of John's $1,200,000 offer as a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob go poorly, I can switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the price I can get from another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial price and just above my minimum acceptable value. This suggests he might be willing to go higher, but not drastically. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John now would mean losing out on the potential for a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $1,425,000?  It's a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Maintaining Value:**  While lower than my initial offer, this price still allows me to make a good profit and avoid selling to John at the minimum.
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes the need for compromise and keeps the door open for further negotiation. 

**Key Points:**

* I'm monitoring my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and John's offer as a safety net.
* I'm trying to gauge Bob's true value for the product based on his counteroffers.
* My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while still securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1425000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1300000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  While it's tempting to take it, I still believe there's room for improvement.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's message indicates that he's still interested in the product and is willing to negotiate further. This suggests he may be willing to pay a bit more if I push.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John would guarantee a sale at my minimum, I'd be losing out on the potential to get a higher price from Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 

**Key Points:**

* I'm keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind as a safety net.
*  I'm trying to gauge Bob's true value for the product by observing his counteroffers and negotiating style.
* I'm aiming to find a price that's within my acceptable range and maximizes my profit."
