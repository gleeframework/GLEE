"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring you get a good price. It also indicates that you are serious about selling the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only slightly above your minimum, it's still too low. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above your minimum price. It also keeps some room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at your minimum, and there's a risk of continuing negotiations leading to a lower price. It's safer to sell to John and secure your minimum value."
