"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is still above Bob's desired price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $12,000 limit, but also trying to be reasonable. A $1,000 reduction is a good starting point.  If Alice rejects, Bob can continue to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500?  I'm willing to work with you to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $12,000 limit. Bob has 7 rounds left and should continue to negotiate a lower price. He can counteroffer at $9,250 or $9,000 to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to work with you on this, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her offer and his last counteroffer. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still keeping his target price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $9,375. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,375 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price point, it's still above his $12,000 limit. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob still has leverage to negotiate a lower price.  He can counteroffer at $9,250 again or even propose a slightly lower price to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you consider $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $9,250.  He's shown a willingness to compromise and is reiterating his desire to close the deal.  He's hoping that Alice will finally accept, as they're getting very close to a mutually beneficial price."
