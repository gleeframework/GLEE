Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, can send to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to benefit significantly while ensuring a suitable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, still landing you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential"" and framing the price as ""fair,"" you make it more palatable for Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. If he's more agreeable, a slightly lower initial offer could work.
* **Urgency:**  Is there a reason Bob might need to decide quickly? Adding a time constraint could encourage him to act fast.

**Remember:**  This is just one approach. You can adjust your offer and message based on any additional information you have about Bob and the negotiation dynamics."
