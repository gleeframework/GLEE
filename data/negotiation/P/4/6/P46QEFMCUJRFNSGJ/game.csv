"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $900000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $950000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950000 is still quite a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's try $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to meet my needs and you to get a valuable product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
