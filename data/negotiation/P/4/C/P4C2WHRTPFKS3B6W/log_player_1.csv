"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  My offer is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $800,000 as a backup gives me confidence to push for a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Offer:** While $1,000,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my ideal. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room to negotiate upwards.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle of my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer outright, I keep the pressure on him and maintain my leverage in the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** My decision to not accept Bob's offer is still backed by the security of John's offer, which gives me the freedom to be more assertive in my counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  I'm aiming to maximize profit and get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I still have leverage due to John's offer and the fact that Bob's offer is already very close to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm again splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Leveraging John:** The security of John's offer gives me the confidence to push for a slightly higher price, knowing I can always walk away and still get $800,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to start narrowing the gap between our offers to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:**  Maximizing profit is still the priority. 
* **Bob's Offer:** $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but I'm still not satisfied.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  The gap between our offers is narrowing, which means there's a good chance I can get a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and consider the risk of not finding a better deal.  However, I'm still willing to gamble a bit to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is my last chance to push for a price closer to my ideal while still remaining reasonable.  
* **Almost There:** $975,000 is only $25,000 away from Bob's latest offer, which means I'm nearing a potential deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a significantly higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm still hoping to close the deal with Bob for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob increases significantly. 
* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  With several rounds of back and forth, it's likely that both Bob and I are getting tired of the negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** While I could still walk away and sell to John, accepting Bob's offer will result in a higher profit.

**It's a calculated risk, but I believe it's worth it to secure a deal with Bob at this price point.**"
