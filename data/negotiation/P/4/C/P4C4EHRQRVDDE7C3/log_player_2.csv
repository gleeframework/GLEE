"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is too close to our fallback option of buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer. By starting with $70, we leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  We want to maintain a positive tone with Alice while clearly stating our price target.
* **Justification:**  We haven't given a specific reason for wanting a lower price, allowing Alice to respond with her own counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your position and would like to meet in the middle. How about $85 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'd consider.  Let's push a little further and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving our offer up gradually ($70 to $75) to show Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Reiteration of Budget:** We're subtly reminding Alice of our price sensitivity without being overly aggressive. 
* **Open to Counter:** By leaving the offer open-ended (""How about...""), we signal that we're open to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. Considering your feedback, how does $80 sound for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met her own value for the product.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $80 ensures we get the product at a decent discount without risking the deal falling through."
