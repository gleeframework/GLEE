"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
