Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum but not too high to scare Bob away immediately.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build a good rapport with him.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while I appreciate his interest, I'm not willing to accept that price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'm not convinced he's going to go any higher.  I don't want to risk another round of negotiations and potentially end up with an even lower offer.  It's better to secure the $12,000 from John and avoid further haggling."
