Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,500,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1750000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of your needs. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer or having to settle for John's offer."
