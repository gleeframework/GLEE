"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm not quite ready to accept $10,500. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This would be a good compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're open to it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
