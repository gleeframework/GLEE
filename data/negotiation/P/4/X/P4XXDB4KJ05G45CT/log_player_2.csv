"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,150,000.  He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves plenty of room for profit for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down, Bob can still potentially get a better price.  He is still willing to pay more than what the product is worth to Alice, but he can try to negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his target of $1,050,000."

This is a fair compromise, allowing you a comfortable margin while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
