"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves plenty of room for profit for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm happy to pay a fair price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, allowing you a comfortable margin while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
