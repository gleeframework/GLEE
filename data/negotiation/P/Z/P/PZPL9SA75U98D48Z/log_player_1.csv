Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how likely he is to accept a lower price.
* Depending on the context (e.g., if we know Bob is very price-sensitive), it might be wiser to start with a lower offer."
