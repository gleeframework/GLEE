I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $80, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $81? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I've only got 4 rounds left.  It's not worth the risk of him rejecting my next offer and then being stuck with a lower price than John is offering.  I'm going to sell to John."
