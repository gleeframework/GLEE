"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price ($200) because I don't know Bob's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting, hoping to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open Ended:** The message is open-ended, prompting Bob to respond with his thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's response to this initial offer. If he rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If it seems like we're not getting close to a mutually agreeable price, I can always choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. Can you consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate a price that's closer to my value. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise.  I'll also aim to understand Bob's reasoning for his low offer to inform my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $170.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $170 is a significant compromise from my initial $200 offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. By showing flexibility, I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and reaching an agreement with Bob. I'll also be monitoring Bob's reaction to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, there's still a small margin for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I could accept $140 and end the negotiation, there's a chance I could get a slightly higher offer if I continue.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price just above his last offer. By showing that I'm still willing to negotiate, I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired $150. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $140 is a good offer, and I'm definitely getting closer to where we need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counteroffer of $145 is exactly in the middle between Bob's last offer of $140 and my desired price of $150. This shows a willingness to meet halfway and signals a desire to reach a conclusion.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I reiterate that this offer is a ""fair compromise"" and a way to finalize the deal.
* **Urgency (Subtly):** I mention ""finally closing this deal"" to subtly imply that we're nearing the end of the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of finality.  It's close enough to Bob's offer that it could be tempting for him to accept. If he doesn't, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next offer, counter again, or move on to selling to John. The number of rounds remaining is becoming a factor now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Can you consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum, But Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.
* **Time is Running Out:**  The negotiation is getting drawn out, and there's a chance I might not reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While $130 is not my ideal price, I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed profit over the potential of getting a slightly higher price from Bob.  The risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds is too high."
