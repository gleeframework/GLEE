(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower, and I want to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows my willingness to negotiate while also leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still a chance she'll go lower. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. This is a reasonable midpoint between Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's still a good price for her, and it's a significant saving for me compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to my ideal price, and there's a risk of continuing negotiations going back and forth.  It's likely Alice will not go lower, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price.  $882,500 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John."
