,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than your initial offer, but I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me halfway.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a fair and profitable transaction. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me here.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $935,000.  This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
