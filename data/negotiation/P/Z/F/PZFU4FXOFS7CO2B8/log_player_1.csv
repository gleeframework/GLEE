"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), we anchor the negotiation high.  Even if this offer is rejected, it sets a strong precedent.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $50,000 difference between our offer and Bob's value provides space for negotiation while ensuring we are significantly above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and proposes the price as a fair starting point, encouraging a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our absolute minimum ($1,000,000), but still leaves a significant potential profit on the table. 
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only Round 2, and accepting this early would signal that we are willing to concede quickly. We have time to negotiate further.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to confidently counter-negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant concession ($30,000), demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also signaling that our initial offer wasn't inflated.
* **Holding Firm:** We are still aiming high, closer to our initial offer than Bob's, aiming to keep the negotiation anchored in the higher range. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, we reinforce why our offer is reasonable and try to move Bob away from focusing solely on the discount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly towards our target price.  While his offer is getting closer to what we'd potentially accept, the pace suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **Above Minimum:** $1,080,000 is still a comfortable margin above our absolute minimum ($1,000,000) and our target price.
* **Time Consideration:** We're not critically low on time yet.  Rejecting this offer maintains pressure on Bob while giving us more rounds to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a mutually agreeable deal. "",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Pressure:**  By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're nearing our limit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between our previous offer and his, showing compromise but holding firm on a price point well above our minimum.
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  We emphasize the benefits to Bob, reiterating the deal's value and our commitment to a mutually agreeable outcome. 

This strategy aims to either secure a strong deal at $1,100,000 or gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our target price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Let's aim for a price of $1,070,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:**  While not our ideal price, $1,070,000 is still a $70,000 profit over our minimum and a reasonable return. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is unlikely to move significantly closer to our $1,100,000 ""final offer"" without considerable time pressure. Further negotiation might yield only small incremental gains.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away or stalling until we're forced to take John's offer. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids a potential loss of the entire surplus."
