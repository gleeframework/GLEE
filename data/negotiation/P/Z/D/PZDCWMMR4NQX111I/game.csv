"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1200000 is significantly below my minimum valuation for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm going to counter with $1750000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of what I'm offering.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm proposing $1550000. This is my best and final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
