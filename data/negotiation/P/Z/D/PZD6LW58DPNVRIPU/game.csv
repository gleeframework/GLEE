"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product seems intriguing,  $1800000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it, given my value for it.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're willing to pay.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can spend. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1500000, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
