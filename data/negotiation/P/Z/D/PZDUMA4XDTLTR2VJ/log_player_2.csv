"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but it's worth seeing if you can get it lower. You have 10 rounds and can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also willing to negotiate. It also gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $70, which is a reasonable price and within my budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
