I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's a decent deal, I'm hoping to save even more. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again. While $13,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
