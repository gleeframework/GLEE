"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering my budget.  However,  $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal on the product and is closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase right away.",13000.0,Bob,4,
