"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and provides a fair return for both of us. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'd still need to be closer to $1,150,000 for this to work for me. How about it?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue this conversation.  While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum, I can't go that low just yet. I'm proposing $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that ensures both of us benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
