"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
