"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm trying to stay within it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
