{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
This is a far cry from the $80 you're willing to pay. You need to counter-offer Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Alice is still above your price point. It's time to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $90. This is a fair price that gives you a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, but I've got to make a profit. I'll meet you at $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You're still a few dollars above your ideal price, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Let's make one last counteroffer and then consider John's deal if it doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $95 is still a little high.  I'm willing to go to $92.  I hope we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $98 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've been pushing hard to get the price down but Alice is still holding out at $98, which is still too high for your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk you won't reach an agreement with Alice, and you only have a few rounds left.  John is offering a guaranteed deal at your desired price.  It's time to cut your losses and move on to John."
