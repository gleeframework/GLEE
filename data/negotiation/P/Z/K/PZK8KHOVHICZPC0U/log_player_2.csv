"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to John, who sells the product for $150. However, there's a chance Alice might counter-offer with a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
