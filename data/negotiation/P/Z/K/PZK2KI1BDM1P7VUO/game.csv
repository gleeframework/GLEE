"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To be fair, I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I agree the product is good, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
