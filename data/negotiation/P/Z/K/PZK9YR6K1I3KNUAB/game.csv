"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to do $95? I'm really interested in the product but need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good value for my product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle. However, $110 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to justify the value of my product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's fair for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
