"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise a bit more. How about we settle on $1,300,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget.  Could we do $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
