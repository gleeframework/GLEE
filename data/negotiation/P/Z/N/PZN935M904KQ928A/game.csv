"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $900,000.  What are your thoughts on that?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 as my final offer. It's a significant reduction, and I need to be mindful of other potential buyers who are interested at a higher price point.  Let me know your decision soon.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it accurately reflects the product's value while considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
