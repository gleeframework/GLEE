"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as it is still significantly lower than the value he places on the product."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $10,500 is a better price than his previous offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $10,750. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable amount. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target of $11,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with a price of $10,500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I still believe it's a fair price for both of us.  It's also a good deal for me, as it's above the price John is willing to pay.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting stuck with a lower price or running out of time completely."
