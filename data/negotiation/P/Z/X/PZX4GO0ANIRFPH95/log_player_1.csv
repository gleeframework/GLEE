Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable to your business. My initial offer is $1,100,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more,  it's a good deal considering the limited negotiation rounds. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
