,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1100000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $800000 for the product. This is my final offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $850000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
