"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's much more advantageous to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by establishing a clear lower bound. Offering $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, making it clear that you're serious about negotiating and hoping to find a mutually agreeable price within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still above your budget.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, and there are still 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price down, but in a way that shows you're still negotiating in good faith.  It's a reasonable increase from your previous offer, showing flexibility, but also leaves some room for further negotiation.  You're getting closer to your budget while still being willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still $25,000 over your maximum.  You have several rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations going and maintains the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a bold move, but a calculated one.  By offering your absolute maximum, you're putting the pressure on Alice.  If she accepts, you get the product within your budget. If she rejects, you can always purchase from John for the same price. You're showing that you're serious about buying, but also that you're not going to overpay. It leaves no room for further negotiation on your side."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $850000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $50,000 over your maximum budget. While you've gotten a much better price than her initial offer, you've already stated your final offer and reached a stalemate.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for your maximum price, so it's the most logical choice at this point.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and you could end up losing valuable rounds trying to convince her."
