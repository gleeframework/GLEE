Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
