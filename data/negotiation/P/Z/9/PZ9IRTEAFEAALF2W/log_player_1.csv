Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible, but you need to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so offering it above that price is crucial.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $140 is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate down a little. This still keeps you comfortably above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, allowing for a more confident negotiation with Bob."
