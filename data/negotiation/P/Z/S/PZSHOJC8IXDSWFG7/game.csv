"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
