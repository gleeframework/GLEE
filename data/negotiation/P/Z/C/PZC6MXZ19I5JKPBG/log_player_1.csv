Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:** A ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit. If Bob accepts, you earn a significant surplus. If he rejects, you still have your fallback option with John."
