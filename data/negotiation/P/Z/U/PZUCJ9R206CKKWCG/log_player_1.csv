"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum price, but I think I can get a better deal. I'll counter his offer.
