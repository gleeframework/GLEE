Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll reap.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1000000.  This is a significant offer and a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer to my budget, it's still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll try to counter with a price slightly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,500,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1350000.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value we both see in this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, I've reached a point where I don't want to risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum desired price, so it's the best option in this situation."
