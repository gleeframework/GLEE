"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2000000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits you'll reap.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1000000.  This is a significant offer and a good starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer to my budget, it's still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1500000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $1500000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1350000.  This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the value we both see in this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
