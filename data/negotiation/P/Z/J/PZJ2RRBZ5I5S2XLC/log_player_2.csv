"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price drop, but he's also being realistic.  $12,500 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a profit for Alice, as the product is worth $12,000 to her. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still below my minimum.  How about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  $13,000 is a smaller jump from Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to come closer to her price. This also leaves room for Alice to come down a bit if she wants to close the deal."
