"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and keeps the negotiation moving.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $7,500. How about $8,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the most I can go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $8,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, so I really need to make sure we reach a fair price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I may need to consider other options.",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so how about $9,100? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",9100.0,Bob,8,
