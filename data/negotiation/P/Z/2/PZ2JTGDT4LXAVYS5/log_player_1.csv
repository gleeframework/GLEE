{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $120, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little more. I will reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $125. Can we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum and still a decent profit. I'm going to accept his offer."
