"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, you know you have John as a backup option. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or resorting to buying from John at your maximum budget."
