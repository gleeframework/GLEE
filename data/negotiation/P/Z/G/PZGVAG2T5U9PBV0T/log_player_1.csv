{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity swiftly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($1,400,000) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive the final price as a better deal, even if it's significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Scarcity & Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we introduce a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns"" aims to reframe Bob's perception of the product's worth, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit by potentially persuading Bob to pay a price significantly above his perceived value. There's a risk that Bob might reject the offer, but having John as a backup ensures Alice gets her minimum desired price."
