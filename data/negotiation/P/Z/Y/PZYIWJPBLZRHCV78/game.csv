"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the true value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
