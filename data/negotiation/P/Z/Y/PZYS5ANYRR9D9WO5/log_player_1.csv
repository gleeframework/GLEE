"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'd rather sell to John for $1,500,000 and secure the price I need.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I'm unlikely to get a better deal."
