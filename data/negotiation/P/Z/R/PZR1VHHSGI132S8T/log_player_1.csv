"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value for the product.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, but with only 4 rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to get him up to $1,000,000.  Selling to John is the safest way to guarantee my minimum value."
