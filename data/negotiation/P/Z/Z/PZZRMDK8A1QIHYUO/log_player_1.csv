"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm starting at $90, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Bob is offering $65. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price yet.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than my asking price.  How about $75? I'm still willing to work with you to reach a fair price."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $70 is a good compromise and I'm happy to accept.  It's better than selling to John for $80 and it keeps the negotiation going."
