{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a good compromise, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $8,000. You have already rejected multiple offers and made counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that you can afford.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's better to secure the product from John at a price you are comfortable with. You can always try to negotiate with Alice again in the future if you find that you need a similar product."
