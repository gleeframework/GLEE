Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your desired price range. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again makes sense. You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still above your ideal price range.  You're still aiming to save as much as possible, and there's likely room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to try and push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $975,000.  It's likely that further negotiation would only result in minor price changes.  At this point, accepting the offer makes sense. You're getting a significant discount compared to John's price, and there's a good chance that you won't be able to get a much better deal."
