"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your own valuation and the potential value it holds for me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle of your last offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product to you and my own valuation. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000, which is closer to our middle ground. I believe this is a fair compromise that will allow us to reach an agreement.  Let's try to make this happen!",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",990000.0,Alice,7,
