"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the range of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $800,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still trying to get a better deal, but I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still very interested in the product. How about we settle this right now at $780,000? That's a significant saving for me and still a good price for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",795000.0,Alice,7,
