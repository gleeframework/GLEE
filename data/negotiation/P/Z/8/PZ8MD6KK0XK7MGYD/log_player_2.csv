Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice has consistently shown a willingness to move down in price, albeit in smaller increments. At $795,000, we're getting a significant discount from her initial offer and are well below John's backup price. The potential savings from continuing to negotiate are likely outweighed by the risk of Alice hardening her stance or the deal falling through entirely."
