"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but one I believe will offer you substantial returns. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. If not, I have another interested party ready to purchase at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her own valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price from John.  By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save a substantial amount of money."
