"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $1150000, which is closer to my budget and hopefully still a good deal for you. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $1250000. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
