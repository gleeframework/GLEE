"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not wise to accept Alice's offer, as it's above your budget.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, hoping she'll be willing to negotiate. This is the price I can get elsewhere, so it's a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $10,000, which is within my budget.  While I'd prefer $8,000, it's not worth risking the deal and going back and forth further.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
