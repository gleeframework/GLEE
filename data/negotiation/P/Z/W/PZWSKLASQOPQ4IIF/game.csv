"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $9500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $9200 for the product. I think this is a fair middle ground that meets both of our needs.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9200 is still a little outside my budget. I'm really hoping to get this product for $8800. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it allows for a quick and agreeable transaction. What do you think?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers, so I'm proposing a price of $8900. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",8900.0,Alice,5,
