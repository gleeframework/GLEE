```

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. How about $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**
