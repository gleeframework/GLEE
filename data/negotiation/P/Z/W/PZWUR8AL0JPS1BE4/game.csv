"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  While $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, I'd be willing to go up to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a significant compromise from my end.  Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $12,500? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
