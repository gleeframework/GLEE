"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $900,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. Hopefully, Alice will see this as a serious offer and be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is within my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
