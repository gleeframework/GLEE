"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum value ($15,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This allows room for negotiation while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still far from my desired profit margin.
* **Proceeding to the Next Round:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  There are 8 rounds left, and I have a good understanding of his initial offer.

**Next Step:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Initial Offer:** I'm  countering with a price that is closer to my initial offer of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and Open Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and open to further discussion. 
* **Show Flexibility:** By lowering my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and indicating a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. 
* **Proceeding to the Next Round:**  I'm confident that I can secure a better price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I have a good understanding of Bob's willingness to negotiate.

**Next Step:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob in Round 5, aiming for a price slightly higher than $10,000. I'll need to find a good middle ground between my desired price and Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  I'm still hoping for a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Slightly Higher:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's offer ($10,000) but still below my previous offer ($11,000). This shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I reiterate the importance of a ""fair deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Staying Positive:**  I maintain a positive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Step:**

I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects my offer, I'll need to determine whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to accept John's offer of $15,000.  There are only 5 rounds left, so the stakes are getting higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $10,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too rich for my blood. How about we stick with my previous offer of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to give in.  There are still 4 rounds left, and I have a better understanding of Bob's negotiating style.  I believe I can still push for a higher price.

**Next Step:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in Round 7, aiming for a price slightly higher than $10,000.  It's important to stay firm in my negotiation while still being open to compromise.  I'll need to find a way to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this deal happen. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Small Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a decent profit margin. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging him to accept the offer.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** I'm pushing for a decision with a direct question, ""Let me know what you think."" This keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Step:**

With only 3 rounds remaining, the stakes are getting higher.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  However, if Bob shows a willingness to budge, I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired $11,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob are slim.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired value of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all, especially since he's not budging from his $9,500 offer.

**Next Step:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale.  This ensures that I get the best possible price for my product and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
