"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is closer to a reasonable figure, I'm aiming for something a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,900,000 is close, but I need to land somewhere that truly reflects its value. Let's settle on $1,975,000. It's a strong offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
