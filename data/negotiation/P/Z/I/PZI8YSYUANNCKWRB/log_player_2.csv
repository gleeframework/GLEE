# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $1,200,000."
