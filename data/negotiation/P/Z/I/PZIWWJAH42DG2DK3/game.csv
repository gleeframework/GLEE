"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $10,000? That's my absolute limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
