"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle on $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
