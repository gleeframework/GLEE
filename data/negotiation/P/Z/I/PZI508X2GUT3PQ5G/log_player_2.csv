"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. There are 9 rounds left, and Bob has a backup option of buying from John for $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
