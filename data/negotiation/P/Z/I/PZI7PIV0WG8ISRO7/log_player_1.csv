Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000.  I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer.
* **Testing the waters:** By starting at $22,000, you gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.  His response will give you insight into how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Potential for profit maximization:** If Bob accepts the $22,000 offer, you significantly exceed your minimum acceptable price and John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your walk-away price is $15,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
