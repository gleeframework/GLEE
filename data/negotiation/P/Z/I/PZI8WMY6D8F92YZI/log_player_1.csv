I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial price of $15,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This still gives you a great price, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on that, I would like to propose a price of $14200 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between value and cost for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm starting to run out of time, and Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer at $14,200 is a reasonable outcome considering the limited rounds remaining."
