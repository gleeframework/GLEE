"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000, so I can't go any lower than that.  It's my final offer - take it or leave it.",12000.0,Alice,5,
