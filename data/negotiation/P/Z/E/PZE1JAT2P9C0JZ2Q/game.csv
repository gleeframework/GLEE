"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping to find a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,150,000.  I believe that still represents excellent value for you, considering the potential benefits this product holds.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,125,000?  It's a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,075,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to feel that it's a good value for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer of $1,075,000, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that still allows you to reap the benefits of this valuable product.  Let's finalize this deal and get you on your way to success.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
