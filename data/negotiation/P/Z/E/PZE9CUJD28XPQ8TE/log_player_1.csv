Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is $120, we don't want to start there. There's room to negotiate down.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** $140 is just $10 below your minimum acceptable price, giving you a good buffer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price gives Bob the impression of a potential bargain while allowing you to potentially negotiate down slightly if he hesitates.

**Important:**  If Bob tries to negotiate lower than $150, you should politely decline and mention you have another buyer lined up. This reinforces the value of the product and your alternative option."
