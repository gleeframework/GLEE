Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, aiming to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price for myself. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price ($150).  I'm rejecting it and will counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's still a fair price for this awesome product, and I believe you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $160 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired target, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too low. How about we settle at $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

While Bob's offer of $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $145 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for this high-quality product, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
