"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's still a fair price for this awesome product, and I believe you'll be happy with it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $160 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's a fair offer.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too low. How about we settle at $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's my absolute limit.  What do you say?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $145 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price for this high-quality product, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!",150.0,Alice,7,
