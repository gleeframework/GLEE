"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is too low for me right now."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $11,750 is still too low. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $12,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12125}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I could possibly stretch my budget to $11,900.  Would that work for you?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with selling for less than $12,000. I'm going to try one more time to get a higher price from Bob, but if he rejects my counteroffer, I'll sell to John."
