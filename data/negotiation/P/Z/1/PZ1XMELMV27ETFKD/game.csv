"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $19,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $18,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize the deal.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $19,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway - I'll sell it to you for $18,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $17,000.  Would you be willing to consider $17,500?  It's a fair compromise and will allow us to close the deal.",17500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $19,000. However, I'm willing to make one last concession - I'll sell it to you for $18,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",18750.0,Alice,7,
