Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,250.

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
I'll reject the offer.  Alice is coming down, and I'm close to John's price. It's worth seeing if I can get it even closer to $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair offer."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $9,500, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $9,800. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could try to haggle Alice down further,  $9,800 is a good price and significantly lower than her initial offer. It's not worth the risk that she won't budge further and I end up having to buy from John at $10,000."
