"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
