"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you say?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115, which is a fair compromise. Let's make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still too far below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $125 is still too much for me. Let's find a middle ground. How about $120? It's a good compromise for both of us and we can finally close this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
