,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100 for the product. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
