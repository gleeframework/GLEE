Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my limit. Even though we're getting close, it's better to go with John's offer for $100. There's no guarantee I can get Alice down to my price, and I'm already close to my limit. It's more sensible to lock in the deal with John and move on."
