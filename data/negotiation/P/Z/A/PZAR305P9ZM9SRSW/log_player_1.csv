"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also establishes a starting point that is closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $150, which is the minimum I am willing to accept. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me, while also being more attractive to Bob. $160 is still above my minimum price, but closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum price, $150. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as this is a fair price for both of us. If he rejects it, I'm ready to sell to John."
