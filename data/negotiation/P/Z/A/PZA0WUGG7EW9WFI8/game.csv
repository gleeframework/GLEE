"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
