{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you a good starting point for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is also lower than the $150 value Bob places on the product, meaning there's room for him to potentially pay more and still be happy.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:** It's not too aggressive and leaves room for negotiation, making it likely Bob will at least consider the offer. 

By starting with this offer, you open up the potential for a successful negotiation and maximize your chances of earning a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80,  it's still significantly lower than the $120 you initially offered.  There's room for negotiation here. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can propose a counteroffer that's more favorable to you, potentially securing a price closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way, we both get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still below the $110 you counter-offered.  You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and rejecting this offer allows you to make a final counter-offer that's likely to be more appealing than selling to John."
