"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high to gauge Bob's interest.  If he's truly interested, he might counter, and we can negotiate. If not, I can always go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to him to make a deal, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While I would ideally get closer to my initial asking price,  I'm nearing the halfway point of the rounds and need to start considering the risk of running out of time.  This offer is still significantly better than John's offer, and it's more likely I won't be able to get a higher offer from Bob."
