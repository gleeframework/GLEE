"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $12,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to him and that he can buy it from John for that price.  Therefore, he makes a counteroffer of $8,000, which is his maximum price and the minimum Alice would likely accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate further, possibly pushing the price even lower. If unsuccessful, Bob can still purchase from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He knows Alice won't go below $8,000 (John's offer), but he's also willing to pay a bit more than his absolute minimum.  By offering $8,500, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate while still remaining within a reasonable range for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to Bob's desired price.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase from John for $8,000, guaranteeing he gets the product at the best possible price for him."
