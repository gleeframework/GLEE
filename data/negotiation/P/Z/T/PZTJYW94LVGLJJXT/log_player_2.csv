"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating a lower price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, but it's still more than Bob wants to pay. It's worth trying to continue negotiating for a lower price. It is better to keep negotiating for now, since there is still time left and the price of John is still higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows a willingness to compromise but still leaves room for negotiation. The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both parties while still saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and knows that Alice is likely motivated to sell. There's still time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8850} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price. He's now only $50 away from his previous offer, so this demonstrates a commitment to finding a middle ground. Since there are still rounds remaining, it makes sense to continue negotiating rather than going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer and is getting closer to John's price.  However, Bob still has several rounds left and has shown a willingness to negotiate. It's likely that Alice is also motivated to sell and will be more open to lower prices as the rounds progress. There's still time to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer significantly from the previous round. This is a strategic move, as it demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also setting a clear limit. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to close the deal. If she rejects this offer, Bob will be in a strong position to either accept her counteroffer or move to John, as there are only two rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Bob needs to make a decisive decision. Alice's latest offer is higher than her previous offer and is very close to John's price.  Given the limited time and the possibility that Alice might not accept a counteroffer in the final round, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John. This ensures that he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
