"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  Let's see if we can make a deal.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
