"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7000 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's my absolute minimum. Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
