``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to you to potentially pique Bob's interest. Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and your understanding of the value he might place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
