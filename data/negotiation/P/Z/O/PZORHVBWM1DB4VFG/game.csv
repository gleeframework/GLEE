"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be immensely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects a significant discount from its true value, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the product's true value and what it can potentially bring to your business. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price is a strong compromise that allows us to close the deal quickly while still ensuring a reasonable return for me. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and while I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, $1,050,000 is still a significant undervaluation of the product. It's important to consider the potential benefits this product can bring to your business, which far outweigh the proposed price.  I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,075,000. This reflects a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this transaction and unlock the value this product holds for your organization.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to make concessions. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand budget constraints, but I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us.  Therefore, I'm willing to offer one final compromise: $1,050,000.  This price bridges the gap between our positions and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's seize this opportunity to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1,025,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I hope we can find a way to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
