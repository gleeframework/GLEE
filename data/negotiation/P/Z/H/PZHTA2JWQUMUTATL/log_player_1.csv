"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it would be a real asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $15,500 for this product. How about we settle at $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close, but that's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price of $15,000. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but at this rate, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
