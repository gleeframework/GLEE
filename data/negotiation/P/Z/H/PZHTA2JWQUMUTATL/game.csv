"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it would be a real asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $15,500 for this product. How about we settle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close, but that's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
