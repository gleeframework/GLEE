"Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $10,000. This is a high-quality item worth significantly more than its face value, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while also providing you with a substantial benefit. I look forward to your response.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given my needs. I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that benefits both of us. I am willing to sell the product for $9,200. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing you to acquire it within your budget. I hope this offer meets your expectations.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $8,800.  This is a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finalize this deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
