Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal to you given its features and benefits. Would you be willing to pay $115 for it?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John.  

By offering the product at $115, we aim to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
