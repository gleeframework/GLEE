"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is the maximum you're willing to pay.
* **Buying from John also costs $12,000.** This is the same price as Alice's offer.

Since both options cost the same, it's better to **reject Alice's offer**. This keeps the door open for a potential counter-offer from Alice, or to negotiate with other sellers if you find better options."
