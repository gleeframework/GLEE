"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think you'll really love it and it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **John's Price:** $100

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you know John will sell it to you for $100. By rejecting Alice's offer, you encourage her to potentially lower the price to secure the sale. If she doesn't budge, you're not losing any money by going with John."
