"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale, and $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000, but that's as low as I can go.",990000.0,Alice,5,
