"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be compensated fairly. How about $1,250,000? This still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
