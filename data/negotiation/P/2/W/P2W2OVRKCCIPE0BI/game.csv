"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than what you've proposed.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
