"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still looking to get as close to the original value as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is a bit higher than your offer but still a good compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,100 is still a little outside my comfort zone.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9200.0,Alice,7,
