Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price. While his offer is tempting, I'm better off selling the product to John for $800,000, which is a secure and acceptable deal."
