"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while still making it a good deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $14,000? That would work well for me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
