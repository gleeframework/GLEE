"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11000. It's worth at least $12000 to you, so it's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than John's price of $12,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $12,000 to you, getting it for $11,000 is a good price. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
