"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could you consider something closer to $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you. I'm willing to make another adjustment to the price. I'm willing to lower it to $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've come down quite a bit, and I appreciate that.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. Could we settle at $775,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far.",825000.0,Alice,7,
