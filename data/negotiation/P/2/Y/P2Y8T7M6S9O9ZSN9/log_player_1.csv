I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum, while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that amount.  If not, we can negotiate further."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,000 is still a good price, but I think I can do better.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, it's a price we can both agree on."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's a little lower than I was hoping for, it's still a decent price.  I don't want to risk him walking away and I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to."
