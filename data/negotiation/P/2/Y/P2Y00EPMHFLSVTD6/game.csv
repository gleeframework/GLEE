"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $6,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's value,  $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for it. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for us to reach a deal. Let me know what you think.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,500 is a bit higher than you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $6,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",6000.0,Alice,3,
