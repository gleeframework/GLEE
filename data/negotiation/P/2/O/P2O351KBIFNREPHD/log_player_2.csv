"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. It's a great deal for both of us and allows us to close this transaction smoothly. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a better price than what John is offering ($1,200,000).  At this point, Bob is only saving $50,000 by going with John.  It's unlikely Alice will come down further, so it's wiser for Bob to accept the deal and secure the product at a reasonable price."
