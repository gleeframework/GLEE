Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win.
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to respond.  
* This offer also strategically positions me to potentially get a better price than John's offer, while also leaving room to negotiate with Bob if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
