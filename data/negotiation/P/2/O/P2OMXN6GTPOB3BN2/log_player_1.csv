Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best value possible. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it would allow me to secure it within my budget.
