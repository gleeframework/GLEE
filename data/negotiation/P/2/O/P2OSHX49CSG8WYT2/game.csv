"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $11,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's try $10,750. This would be a good middle ground, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,900 is still above my maximum budget. Let's split the difference and go with $10,450. This price is fair considering both our needs and allows us to close this deal.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",10450.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,700 is getting closer, it's still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200, which is a fair price given the value of the product for me. I believe this is a good compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal!",10200.0,Bob,8,
