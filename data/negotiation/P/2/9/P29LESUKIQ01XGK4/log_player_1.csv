Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly lower than the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's estimated value. This allows for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point. 
* **Enticing Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:** $1,100,000 is still less than the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to compromise.  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to find a price that's closer to my target but still within Bob's range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still a bit higher than that.  Would you be willing to come up to $1,125,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding the Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Enticing Language:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""good deal"" to emphasize the benefits of my counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess whether I want to continue negotiating or sell to John. If I choose to continue, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. How about we try $1,075,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Continuing negotiation is risky:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a longer process. 
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:** Selling to John guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get a guaranteed minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
