Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount:**  $1,100,000 is a good discount from your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This makes the offer appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. You can go lower if you have to, but not below your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  It's important to be upfront about your desired price and communicate the value of the product.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** Be prepared for Bob to counteroffer. If he does, analyze his offer and make a decision based on your minimum acceptable price and your desire to close the deal.
* **John's offer:** Remember, you can always walk away from Bob and sell to John for $1,200,000. This provides you with a safety net and leverage in your negotiation with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's not a deal I can accept. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low. I understand it's a significant investment, but consider the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,025,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Given Bob's continued interest and the possibility that we could continue to negotiate for a lower price, I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
