"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is simply too low. I understand it's a significant investment, but consider the value this product offers you. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
