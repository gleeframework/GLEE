You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob should reject the offer. $1,400,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he needs to be realistic.  Offering $1,200,000 is a strong starting point, showing Alice he's serious about negotiating. This price is still below Alice's minimum value, leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob should reject the offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still get a better price. There are still rounds left, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This offer is still well within his budget and is a fair compromise considering Alice's last offer.  He's hoping Alice will accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob should accept this offer.  $1,275,000 is a great price for him, considering his maximum budget is $1,500,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get stubborn or even increase her price again. It's more likely that he'll get a better deal than what John is offering, and he can also save time by closing the deal now."
