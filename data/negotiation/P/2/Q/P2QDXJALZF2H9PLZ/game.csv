"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. Given my maximum price point, I'd like to propose $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm confident this product can bring you considerable value beyond what you're currently estimating. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $950,000? This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,5,
