While I can't disclose specifics without jeopardizing its worth, I'm confident this product could be a game-changer for you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential and leaves room for significant profit.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1000000.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
