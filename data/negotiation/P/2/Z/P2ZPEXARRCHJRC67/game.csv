,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a fair price. $12,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
