"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice. However, you are looking to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is already at her minimum price. Since you have the option to buy from John, you can use John's offer as leverage in the negotiation. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can make a counteroffer at a lower price, aiming to get a better deal. This is a better strategy than accepting Alice's offer or buying from John right away."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. What are your thoughts on that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, but it's still higher than you're aiming for.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  While buying from John is an option, you're still better off trying to get a better price from Alice."

I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and it gives you a comfortable profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1100000. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1300000. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $1,200,000, which is the lowest she's willing to go.  This is a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than the price you'd pay from John. While you might be able to get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a price lower than John's, saving you $300,000."
