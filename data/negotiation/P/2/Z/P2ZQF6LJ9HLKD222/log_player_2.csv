Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Would you be open to considering that?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount (20%) from Alice's initial price, while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  It signals your interest in the product while making it clear that you're prepared to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1350000, which is a $150000 discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to push for a lower price:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your initial goal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer still leaves space for Alice to counter and allows for a potential middle ground to be reached.
* **Maintaining a firm but respectful tone:**  The message conveys interest in the product while maintaining a firm stance on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to go up to $1250000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1300000? It's a $50000 compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price for this incredible product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on price, it's still above my preferred range. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of the deal before resorting to John's offer or accepting at this point.  There's still room for a small counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I can go to $1,275,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful counteroffer:** This counteroffer only raises the offer by $25,000, demonstrating that we are very close to an agreement.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, suggesting a mutually beneficial solution. 
* **Urgency and finality:**  The message implies a desire to close the deal, adding a slight sense of pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll include a 2-year warranty on the product, which is a $50000 value. So, the total price would be $1275000, plus the warranty, which is essentially worth $1325000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is within budget:** The price of $1,325,000 is still within my acceptable range, especially considering the additional value of the warranty.
* **Value of the warranty:** The warranty adds a significant value to the deal, potentially exceeding the additional $50,000 cost. 
* **Limited time:** With only a few rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. 

While I would prefer a lower price,  the warranty makes this a good deal considering the limited time remaining and the possibility of having to buy from John at a higher price."
