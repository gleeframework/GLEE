"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and allows us to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
