Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my target price of $1,500,000. I still have time and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While I'm hoping to get a better price, I don't want to risk losing out completely. John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which meets my minimum requirement and is a safer option at this point."
