"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a significant return for us. We propose to sell the product to you for $950000. This offer not only secures a substantial profit for us but also allows you to benefit from the unparalleled value this product can bring to you. We look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but still not ideal.** You'd be paying $950,000, but you value the product at $1,000,000. This means you'd still be getting a good deal.
* **However, you're trying to save as much money as possible.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or wait for her offer to decrease. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open up the possibility of a better deal. You can either counter-offer Alice with a lower price or wait and see if she lowers her price."
