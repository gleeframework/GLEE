"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good starting point.  I want to see if he'll accept a price closer to my ideal range without going straight for the $8,000 John is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than the $8,000 John offers, I'm not satisfied with the deal yet. I believe I can get more from Bob.  I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer. It's a compromise that could appeal to him while still leaving me closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than what John is offering.  With only a few rounds left, I need to secure a sale. I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John."
