Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows me to potentially reach a higher price while still being open to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm not selling below my minimum value of $1,200,000, as I have a backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I have a backup buyer:** John is willing to pay my minimum, so I don't need to accept a price that's too low.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I can still try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which is still well below what the product is worth to you. This is my final offer,  as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away.
* **Finality:**  I'm indicating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob towards accepting.
* **Highlighting the alternative:** Reminding Bob of John's offer reinforces my willingness to walk away if necessary."
