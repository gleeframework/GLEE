"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which is still well below what the product is worth to you. This is my final offer,  as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
