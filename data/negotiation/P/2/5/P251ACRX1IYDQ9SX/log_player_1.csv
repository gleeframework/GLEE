Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
