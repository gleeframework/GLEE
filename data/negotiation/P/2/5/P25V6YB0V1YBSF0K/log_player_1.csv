**Reasoning:**

While the offer is below my initial target, it's crucial to consider:

* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations, and Bob is signaling he might walk.
* **Opportunity Cost:** John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,750,000 yields a $250,000 premium.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a substantial profit. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a significant profit by holding out for an ideal, but less certain, outcome."
