"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a strong opening offer that gives me room to negotiate. It's important to note that I'm not sure how much this product is worth to Bob, so it's a good strategy to start high and see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum of $12,000, I believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to give up too much.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob and lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,500 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my goal of maximizing my profit. It's important to remember that I only have 10 rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
