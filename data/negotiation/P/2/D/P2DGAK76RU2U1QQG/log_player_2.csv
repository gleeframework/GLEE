You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $900,000.  There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is increasing her price, but it's still within Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There's still a chance to get a better deal than $950,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price that's very close to Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiations will be difficult and may not result in a significant price drop.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John, who is offering a fixed price within Bob's budget.  This eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations and ensures Bob gets the product within his price range."
