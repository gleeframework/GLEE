"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $9,400? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value you place on the product. What do you say?",9400.0,Alice,5,
