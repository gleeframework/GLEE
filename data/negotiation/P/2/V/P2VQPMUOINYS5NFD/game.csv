"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the sale.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,225,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested and we can finalize the sale.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
