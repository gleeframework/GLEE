"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a great deal to you. I understand it holds a value of $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which represents a significant gain for both of us. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $800000. Let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,1,
