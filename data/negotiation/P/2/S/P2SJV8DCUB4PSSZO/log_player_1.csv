"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.  I believe it would greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer that's on the higher end of your desired range. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, starting close to that figure increases the chances of him accepting immediately or countering with an offer favorable to you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,400,000 offer leaves a potential $400,000 buffer for negotiation while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table. 

It's early in the negotiation, and we have room to counter. We'll aim to meet somewhere closer to the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $1,300,000, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. This can encourage Bob to reciprocate with further concessions.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer ensures we remain well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  We're reiterating the unique value proposition of the product, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has incrementally increased his offer, signaling his genuine interest. At $1,250,000, we're reaching a point where the deal is very favorable for us:

* **Significant Profit:** We're securing a profit of $250,000 above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and the possibility of Bob reducing his offer further. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While we might be able to squeeze a bit more from Bob, the difference isn't likely to outweigh the security and speed of accepting his current offer."
