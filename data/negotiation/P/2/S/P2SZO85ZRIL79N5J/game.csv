"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1200000, which is $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
