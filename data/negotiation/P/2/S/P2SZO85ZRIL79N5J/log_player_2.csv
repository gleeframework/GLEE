"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to try to get the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1200000, which is $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 to ensure he stays within his budget. While there's always the possibility of further negotiation with Alice, the risk of exceeding his budget is too high."
