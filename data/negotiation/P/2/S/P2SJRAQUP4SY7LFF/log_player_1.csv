Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation.  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000 again, hoping we can find a sweet spot. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has stalled at $1,075,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting this offer secures a $75,000 profit over John's offer, which is a reasonable outcome at this stage of the negotiation.  Continuing to push for a higher price carries the risk of Bob walking away."
