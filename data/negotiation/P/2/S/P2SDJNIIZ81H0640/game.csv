"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $15,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $16,500.  How about $18,000? This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,5,
