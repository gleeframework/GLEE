"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. To be honest, I'm working with a budget closer to  $700,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm proposing $1,700,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing its worth.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems like we're getting closer.  How about $800,000?  That's the absolute top of my budget, but I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable.",800000.0,Bob,6,
