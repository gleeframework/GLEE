"Hi Bob, I'm selling a great [product name] that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm starting the price at $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit out of my budget for this product. I'm really interested, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm sure you'll find this product worth the investment.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still below my minimum. Let's try $105. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to go to $98, which is a good compromise and closer to what I can afford. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",98.0,Bob,6,
