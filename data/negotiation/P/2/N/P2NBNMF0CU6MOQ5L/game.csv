"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price that considers both of our needs.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $132.50 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $135. This is a fair price that's closer to my bottom line.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $133?",133.0,Bob,6,
