``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,130,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,125,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and getting the product for a price that's within my budget and a good deal for me.  It's unlikely I can get a lower price from Alice at this point, and buying from John would cost me significantly more."
