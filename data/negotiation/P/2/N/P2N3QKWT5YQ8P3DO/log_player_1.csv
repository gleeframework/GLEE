I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm eager to sell, $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I will counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm disappointed that Bob is not willing to meet me closer to my asking price,  I don't want to risk further negotiation. John's offer of $1,200,000 is above my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a sale.  I'll sell to John."
