Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value.  

Here's the offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its features and potential, I'm confident it's a valuable asset. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I've received significant interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start with a strong, confident tone, highlighting the product's uniqueness.
* **Premium Pricing:** The asking price of $1,200,000 is a significant markup over Bob's value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming high.
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning ""other parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You achieve a fantastic sale price above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. You can then decide if you're willing to go lower, knowing your walk-away point is $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John, securing your $1,000,000.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer in this scenario. In a real-world negotiation, there would likely be back-and-forth discussions."
