Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit, as it's above your $120 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  Bob is likely to be interested since he values the product at $150.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's too low. I'd rather risk another round of negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
