"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a little too much for me. Let's try $90. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $97.50. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $95, which would give you a good price and allow me to purchase the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $98.25. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",98.25,Alice,7,
