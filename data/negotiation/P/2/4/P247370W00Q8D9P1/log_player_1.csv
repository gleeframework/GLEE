Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering your value of $12,000 and my maximum budget of $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
