"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product for me. However, $800000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $650000.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle at $700000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725000. I think this product is worth every penny of that amount, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $725000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",725000.0,Alice,5,
