Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message establishes rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By asking Bob what he thinks, I'm inviting a counteroffer and starting the negotiation process. 
* **Not too aggressive:**  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not starting at a price that's likely to immediately alienate Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still too low:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise. 
* **Potential for better deal:** By continuing negotiations, I have the opportunity to potentially secure a price closer to $120 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my ideal price point.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering to split the difference is a common negotiation tactic that can make the proposal seem more fair.
* **Motivating Bob:**  Highligting the fact that $110 is still a good deal for Bob might encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I am not giving in to Bob's initial offer but am showing some flexibility to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, which would be $105. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $105 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Further Negotiations Unlikely:** It's likely Bob won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely.
* **Time is Money:** While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting $105 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing time and potentially needing to sell to John for $80."
