Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is:

* **Good for you:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potentially appealing to Bob:** It's lower than the product's worth to him ($12,000) leaving room for negotiation.

This strategy aims to create a good starting point for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. You know the product is worth more to Bob, and you can likely secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, you can send a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price point. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while also maintaining your value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows you're willing to negotiate but also ensures a profit margin greater than selling to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,250 is the midpoint between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This makes the offer appear reasonable and fair.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product while remaining open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9250, which would be $8875. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,875 is a good compromise. While it's still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over his initial offer and very close to your minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John for a lower amount."
