# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value to you. I understand this product is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a great chance to acquire a valuable asset at a very competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
