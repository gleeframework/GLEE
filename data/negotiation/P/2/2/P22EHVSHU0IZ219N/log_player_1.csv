"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
