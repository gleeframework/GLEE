Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to his maximum valuation as possible without going over, ensuring he accepts the deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees you at least $100, so you don't need to go below that.

By offering the product at $115, you leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $5), while you maximize your profit (earning $15 more than selling to John)."
