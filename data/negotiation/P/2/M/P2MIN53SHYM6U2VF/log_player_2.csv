{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum value as possible.  A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's still higher than Bob would like to pay.  Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while remaining below Alice's initial price. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that is closer to Alice's latest offer but still within Bob's budget and potentially attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is moving in the wrong direction for Bob. It's higher than her previous offer and closer to John's price. At this point, the risk of continuing negotiation is not worth it. The potential savings are minimal, and there's a strong chance Alice will keep pushing for a higher price.  Buying from John guarantees a known price, even if it's more expensive."
