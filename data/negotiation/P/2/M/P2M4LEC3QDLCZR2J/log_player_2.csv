"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand the value this product holds for you, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?  This price reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a good sign, and shows Alice is willing to negotiate.  However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There is still room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
