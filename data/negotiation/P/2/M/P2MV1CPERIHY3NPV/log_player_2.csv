# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
