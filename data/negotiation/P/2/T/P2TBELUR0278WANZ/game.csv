"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
