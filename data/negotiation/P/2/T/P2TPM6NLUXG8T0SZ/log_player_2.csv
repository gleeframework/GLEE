"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $125. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $125 is better than John's offer of $150, but it's still above your desired price range.  Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would be the best strategy, even though it's more expensive."
