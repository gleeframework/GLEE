``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also avoids immediately revealing your minimum price, keeping some leverage.  I'm confident that Bob will make a counter-offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to that figure through further negotiation with Bob.  I will counter his offer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $975,000? This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to suggest a price of $960,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, $960,000 is still below my minimum. I will counter with a higher offer, hoping to find a price we can both agree on.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that doesn't meet my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $960,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering the product to you for $965,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 965000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $962,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both of our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it still falls short of my minimum value. I'm not willing to further negotiate with Bob and risk losing valuable time. The potential risk of further negotiation is not worth the chance of not achieving my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees a comfortable profit and allows me to move on."
