"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I can come down to $13,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,500 is a good price, and it's getting late in the negotiation. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to haggle."
