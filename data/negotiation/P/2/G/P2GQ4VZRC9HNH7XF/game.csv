"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $200 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $150 for it.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it for $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $150.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer at that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
