"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still above your budget of $800,000.  While you may be able to negotiate further, it's likely the price will remain above what you're willing to pay.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you the product at a price you can afford and avoids further negotiation."
