Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,300,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price, but we're getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I have 5 rounds left and might be able to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.

Let's work towards a solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:

This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we've been negotiating for a while, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,200,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to lose interest in continuing the negotiation. My counteroffer is $1,250,000 for the product, and if this is not acceptable, I'll be forced to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, and I'm not sure I can get it down further without risking losing the deal.  While $1,250,000 is still a bit high, it's better than buying from John for $1,500,000.  However, with only one round left, the odds of getting a better price are slim.  I'm going to go with John, as it's a more predictable outcome."
