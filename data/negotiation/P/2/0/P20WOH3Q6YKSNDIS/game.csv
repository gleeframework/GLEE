"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation off strong!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to $950,000. Can we compromise on that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It's time to finalize this deal - let's make it happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to $925,000. Can we compromise on that price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? We've been going back and forth, and I think this is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,7,
