"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to earn a decent profit. 
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Setting the tone:**  This initial offer establishes that I'm serious about selling, but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While he is willing to pay a premium, $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to accept a loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds left.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price and see if Bob is willing to compromise. 
* **John is an option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage during negotiations.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original price. I'm offering the product for $9,500.  This is a fair price that considers your budget and my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but not closing the door completely.  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing Bob with a reason for the higher price.  It's not just arbitrary, it's based on my valuation of the product.
* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial $10,000 offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting would mean taking a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I'm not in a rush. With 6 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **John is a fallback:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small counteroffer:** I'm only counteroffering $250 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm open to compromise but still want to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm highlighting that this offer is a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Closing pressure:** I'm mentioning that I want to close the deal to nudge Bob towards making a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is inching closer, $9,100 is still significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting would mean taking a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I have 4 rounds left. I can continue to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **John is a fallback:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob.  At this point, the risk of losing the deal to John is lower than the risk of accepting a significantly lower offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $9,100 is still a bit low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $9,150. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. We're both close to a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer sets a clear deadline for Bob to make a decision.  It implies that I am running out of patience and might soon accept John's offer.
* **Small counteroffer:**  It's only a $50 increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive encouragement:**  I'm reminding Bob that we are ""both close to a deal"" to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  The implication that I might soon accept John's offer adds pressure to Bob, subtly reminding him that he might lose the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $9,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the last few rounds, and the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There is little chance of him increasing his offer further.
* **John's offer is significantly better:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a much more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's offer and taking a substantial loss. 

Given these factors, the best decision is to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While it's disappointing to lose Bob as a customer, securing a higher profit is a more strategic move at this point."
