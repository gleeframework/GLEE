,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $85. I really think that's a good compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? That would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'd be willing to go up to $87.50, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $87.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92.50, which is a significant compromise from my initial price.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet in the middle.",92.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I really think $87.50 is the highest I'm willing to pay. I'm not comfortable going any higher. Can we stick with my previous offer?",87.5,Bob,8,
