"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and see your desire for a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price point, I'm still aiming for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful partnership.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your proposal. I understand your perspective and respect the value you place on the product. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to agree to a price of $1,150,000. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This price aims to find a balance between our interests while remaining within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
