Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant profit for me, but it's still lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will entice Bob to accept, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still less than I would like, it's only $500 less than my counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the best option as it guarantees me a good profit and prevents further negotiation, which could risk losing the sale altogether."
