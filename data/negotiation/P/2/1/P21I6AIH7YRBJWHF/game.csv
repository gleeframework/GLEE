"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. Would $750000 be within your consideration?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I am still working within my budget, so I would like to propose a price of $825000. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with what I am able to spend.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $900000. This is the last time I'm willing to adjust the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I am unable to meet you at $900000. My final offer remains at $850000. I hope this is a price that you can consider reasonable.",850000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1200000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I can consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to decline your offer.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
