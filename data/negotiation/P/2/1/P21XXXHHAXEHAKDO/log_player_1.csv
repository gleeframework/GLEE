Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving and earning you significantly more than its cost. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the potential value it could bring to my operations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Accepting $1,075,000 would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This price reflects a more equitable split of the potential gains we both stand to make."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the original price you mentioned was $1,000,000, and you're now offering it for $1,125,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,062,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation around the $1,000,000 figure.  While his offer is getting closer to an acceptable range, I still believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand this product's value. I'm willing to make one final concession and drop the price to $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the substantial returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the original price you mentioned was $1,000,000, and you're now offering it for $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is sticking to his pattern of halving the difference. While I could likely push him a bit further, we're getting into dangerous territory. It's unlikely he'll go much higher than $1,050,000, and risking the deal for a potentially small gain isn't worth losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer secures a good profit."
