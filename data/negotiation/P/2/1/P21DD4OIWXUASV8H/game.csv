"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. To get the ball rolling, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from what I know the product is worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1000000 is significantly below what I know the product is worth, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1250000. This is a fair price that takes into account both your budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $1250000. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  To make this work, I'm offering $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
