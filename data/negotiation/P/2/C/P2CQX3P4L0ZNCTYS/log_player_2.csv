"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's quite valuable and would be perfect for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, accepting the offer at $140 is still a $10 savings compared to buying from John."
