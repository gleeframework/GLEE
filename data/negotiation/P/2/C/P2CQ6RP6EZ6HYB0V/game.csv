"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still gives you a significant value for the product. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's see if we can find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but we're still not quite there.  I can do $975,000. That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it's fair given your last concession.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for you. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
