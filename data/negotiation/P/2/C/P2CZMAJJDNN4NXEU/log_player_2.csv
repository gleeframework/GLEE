**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. There's no room for negotiation, and you'll end up paying the same amount whether you buy from Alice or John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open for a possible better deal in the future."
