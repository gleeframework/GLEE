Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob sees the value in the product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more conservative with my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get closer to $900,000. While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe there's room for a bit more negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit low for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $900,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the potential of this product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go below $900,000. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to lose out on a significant amount of money.  John is a reliable buyer and offers a reasonable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
