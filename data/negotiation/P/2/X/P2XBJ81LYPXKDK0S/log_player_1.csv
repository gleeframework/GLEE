"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor:**  Setting a high initial price can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially leading him to counteroffer closer to your target price.
* **Gather Information:** Bob's response will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay. A quick acceptance would indicate you might have aimed too low, while a strong rejection could suggest a longer negotiation.
* **Maintain Control:** By taking the lead with the first offer, you set the initial tone for the negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space to make concessions and reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant profit, we're aiming to maximize earnings. Bob's counteroffer indicates flexibility and a strong interest in the product. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing us to push for a higher price. We are still significantly above our minimum and have ample rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits us both.  How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We've moved from our initial high offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Significant Concession, But Not Too Much:**  A $150,000 reduction is substantial but still keeps us well above Bob's initial offer and our minimum.
* **Clear Target:** By meeting in the middle, we're signaling that a price around this range is ideal for a deal. 
* **Maintain Momentum:**  We want to avoid stalling the negotiation and encourage Bob to continue engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,600,000 represents a $600,000 profit, significantly exceeding our minimum.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, prolonging negotiations might not yield significantly better results, and risks losing Bob altogether. 

Accepting at this point secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential risk of Bob walking away or further lowball offers."
