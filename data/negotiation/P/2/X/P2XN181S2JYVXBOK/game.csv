"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $180 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to make a profit.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $95?  That's a fair bit closer to your price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's closer to my minimum price.",110.0,Alice,5,
