"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price above what the product is worth to me, but leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while maintaining a firm stance on my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept a price below $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired value.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but staying above $1,000,000. This shows flexibility while maintaining my minimum acceptable profit margin. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd like to get a higher price from Bob, with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good outcome and minimizing potential losses."
