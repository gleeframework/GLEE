"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for a profitable transaction for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a considerable reduction on my initial price and presents a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
