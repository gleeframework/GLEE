"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which I believe holds significant value for your business. While I value it at no less than $800000, I'm willing to negotiate a price that benefits both of us. I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm open to discussing a price that reflects its worth. Let's talk. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
