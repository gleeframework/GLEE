"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $11000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still more than your maximum budget of $10,000.  You've already rejected her first offer, so it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to her desired $11,000 than your desired $10,000.  It's more efficient and less time-consuming to buy from John, who is offering the product at your maximum budget."
