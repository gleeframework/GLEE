{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop from my initial offer. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $11,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
