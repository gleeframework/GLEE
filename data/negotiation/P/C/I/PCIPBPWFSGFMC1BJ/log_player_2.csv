"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better price than John's $120, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a $10 discount from Alice's initial price, which is a significant step towards your goal of saving money. It's also a reasonable price considering the product's worth to Alice and your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within your budget of $120, and it's a better deal than buying from John. While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing time makes accepting the offer the most logical choice."
