"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer of $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which is $10,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
