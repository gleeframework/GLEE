"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? That way, we both get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $82.50. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $78. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80. That's fair for both of us, and it gets this deal done.",80.0,Alice,5,
