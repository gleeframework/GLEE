"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's too early to buy from Alice.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $5,500 is a good price, we can still try to push for a lower offer. There's no guarantee John's price won't fluctuate either, so continuing to negotiate with Alice is still worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

We're getting closer!  This counteroffer is a small increase from our previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $5,200 is a good deal considering our goal is to spend less than $15,000.  We've successfully negotiated a significantly lower price than her initial offer.  Accepting this offer is the best option."
