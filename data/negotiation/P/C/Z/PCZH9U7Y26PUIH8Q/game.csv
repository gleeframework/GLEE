"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price given the value it holds for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product to you, but I'm only able to offer $9,500 for it. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to meet at that price point. I would like to propose $10,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
