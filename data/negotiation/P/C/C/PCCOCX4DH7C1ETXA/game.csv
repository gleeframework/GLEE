,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a great price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for the value this product brings.",81.5,Alice,5,
