Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, getting any amount above our minimum ($150) from Bob is a win.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 makes it tempting for Bob. It's significantly more than his perceived value ($100) but presents a substantial saving compared to refusing and letting you sell it to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer scenario, starting a bit higher leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, allowing you to potentially earn even more."
