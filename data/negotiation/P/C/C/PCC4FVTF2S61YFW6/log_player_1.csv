Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value to you, as you know, is considerable. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:**  You emphasize the product's value to Bob, aiming to anchor his perception at a high level.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Creating a sense of urgency and scarcity (limited-time offer, other interested parties) can push Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit by leveraging Bob's potential willingness to pay a premium. If Bob accepts, you make a significant gain. If he rejects it, you still have your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
