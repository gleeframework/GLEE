Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. Considering your persistence, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while another round *might* get the price down a little more, it's risky. $825,000 is a reasonable compromise, well below my $1,200,000 maximum, and a decent savings over John's offer."
