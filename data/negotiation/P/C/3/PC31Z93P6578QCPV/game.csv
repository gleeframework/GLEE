"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $775,000. Considering your persistence, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
