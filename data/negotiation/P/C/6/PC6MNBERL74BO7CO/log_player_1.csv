Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $23,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 23000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, and I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000,  I want to start with a significantly higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the high price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject this high offer. However, I'm willing to take that risk because I have a backup buyer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate the price downwards in subsequent interactions. My goal is to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
