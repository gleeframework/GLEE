# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly decreasing her price and unwilling to budge much from her $9,250 offer. We're now at round 7, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap significantly. It's not worth the risk of Alice remaining above $10,000 in the remaining rounds. Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees a better price than continuing with Alice and potentially overpaying."
