# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
