,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product, but that's as high as I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
