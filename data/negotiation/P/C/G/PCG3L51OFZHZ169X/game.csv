,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is my final price. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we settle at $8,750? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,125.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to consider other options.",9125.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,7,
