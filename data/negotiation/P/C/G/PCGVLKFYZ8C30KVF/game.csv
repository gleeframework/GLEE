"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair price.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500. I'll sell the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",8250.0,Alice,5,
