"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired $10,000 floor as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is close to my floor, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target $10,000, we're already on round 4 and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $9,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000. It's important to be pragmatic and secure a deal when it's a good one."
