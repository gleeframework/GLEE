{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer, as it's above your budget.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer, hoping to get Alice to meet me halfway. This counteroffer is still within my budget and is a significant discount from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still keeping the price within my acceptable range.  Hopefully, this shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget."
