"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's less than Alice's value, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's worth to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for the product.

``` 

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice has shown she's unwilling to come down to a price Bob is comfortable with.  While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of Alice continuing to counteroffer and driving the price higher is too great.  John is offering a guaranteed price that aligns with Bob's budget."
