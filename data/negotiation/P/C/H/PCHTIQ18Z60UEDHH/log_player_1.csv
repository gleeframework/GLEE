Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, making him more likely to consider accepting.  If he rejects, I'll be ready with a counteroffer and I can always fall back on selling to John for $150 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's worth continuing negotiations with Bob, as he's already shown interest.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $120? That's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
