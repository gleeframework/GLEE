"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way out of my budget.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen. However, the value I offer needs to be reflected in the price. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
