"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",

}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the starting point of the negotiation.  While it's much lower than Alice's initial offer, it provides room for negotiation and lets Alice know our price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down slightly, she's still aiming for her maximum value. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price, but also willing to negotiate.  We'll reject this offer and counter with something closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This offer represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

We're getting closer to our maximum budget, but we want to see if we can still negotiate a bit more. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to move, but we're still looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $750,000. My absolute lowest price for this product is $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It seems we've reached an impasse with Alice. She's unwilling to go below $900,000, and we know we can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
