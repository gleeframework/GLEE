"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This offer represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $750,000. My absolute lowest price for this product is $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
