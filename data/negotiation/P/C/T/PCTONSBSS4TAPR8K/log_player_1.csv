Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with an offer higher than your bottom line ($12,000). This leaves room for potential negotiation and compromise.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, Alice provides a reason for her higher asking price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer is high enough to potentially deter Bob if he's not truly serious, but it also gives him a chance to counter-offer if he's genuinely interested.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 if Bob declines."
