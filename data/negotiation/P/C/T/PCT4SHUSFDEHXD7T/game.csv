"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far too high for me.  While I see the value in this product, my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's work together to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
