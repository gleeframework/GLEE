"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's still higher than Alice's minimum price ($120), showing he's serious about buying the product. He's also leaving room for negotiation in case Alice needs to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's a great deal for a product you value at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still hoping to get it for $130. There's still room for negotiation, and he can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $130.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his counteroffer of $130. He's shown that he's serious about buying the product but is not willing to go higher.  By reaffirming his offer and emphasizing the deal, he's hoping to convince Alice to accept."
