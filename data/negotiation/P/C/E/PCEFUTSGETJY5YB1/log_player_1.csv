Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. Even though $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I can't go above $12,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $12,000 and I've already lowered my price. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to negotiate a higher price in the next rounds. Since John is also offering $12,000, it's not worth risking the deal. I will sell the product to John."
