"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 is still well above my minimum of $800,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This gives me an idea of Bob's maximum.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll likely offer a counteroffer closer to $1,000,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise from my initial offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential profit for him.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  $950,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing flexibility, and I believe I can push for another $50,000.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll offer a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, hoping to close the deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between our last offers.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us.
* **Last Chance for a Higher Price:**  This is likely my last opportunity to get a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is the best price for me. How about we meet at $960,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  $960,000 is very close to my goal, and Bob has stated this is his final offer. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away and potentially losing a sale. 
* **Better than John:**  $960,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. 

It's important to weigh the potential loss of a better deal in the future against the guaranteed profit of accepting this offer. In this situation, securing the sale with Bob at $960,000 seems like the most prudent choice."
