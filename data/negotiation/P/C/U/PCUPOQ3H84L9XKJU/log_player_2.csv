"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is less than your maximum budget of $10,000, you know you have another option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer might encourage her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal.  If her next offer is still above $10,000, you can always buy from John."
