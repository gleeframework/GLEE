"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 to start.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, your offer is considerably below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply. I understand this product is valuable to you, but that price is still too high for me.  I could go up to $900,000 if you're willing to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make a more substantial move if you are. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, but it needs to make financial sense for me.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're getting close! I appreciate you moving in my direction. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value the conversation we've built. If you're able to meet me at $1,180,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
