{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value for you.  I'm asking $1,200,000 for it, recognizing its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but I believe we can find a more agreeable price. How about offering the product for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $950,000 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I still believe we can find a fair price. How about $1,025,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price,  $1,025,000 is a fair compromise and ensures a successful transaction. It's also better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
