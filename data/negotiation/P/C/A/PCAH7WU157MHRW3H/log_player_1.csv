"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($150) but still below John's offer. This way, I leave room for negotiation without risking a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $150, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price.  There are still rounds left and I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product and I'm willing to pay $130 for it. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm willing to make a decision today. Can you sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tedious and I'm not making much progress with Bob.  I'm confident I can get my minimum from John, so I'll sell to him and avoid further haggling."
