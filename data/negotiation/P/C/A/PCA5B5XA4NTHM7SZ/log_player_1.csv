Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  I'm offering it to you for $1,490,000. I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price considering the potential return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor, Slight Negotiation Room:**  Starting with a price very close to your guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. The slight discount provides a psychological incentive for Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing potential benefits rather than just stating the price outright.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By not mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that this is a limited-time opportunity, potentially pushing Bob to act faster.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob without completely pushing him away. If he rejects, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your desired minimum."
