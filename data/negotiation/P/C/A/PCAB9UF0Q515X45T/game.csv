"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $75?  That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $78?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $81? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
