"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $75 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper by negotiating. There are 9 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to counteroffer and see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $60 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  You have many rounds left, so you can adjust your counteroffers depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $65 is a decent price, you're still trying to save as much as possible. There are still 7 rounds left, giving you ample opportunity to negotiate further.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 62}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has come down to $65, it shows she's willing to negotiate. A counteroffer of $62 is a small step closer to her price, demonstrating that you're taking her offer seriously but still aiming for a better deal. You're showing flexibility while also keeping your goal of saving money in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $63, which is very close to your counteroffer of $62.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and you're likely getting close to the lowest price Alice is willing to go. There's only a $1 difference between her offer and your desired price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  You could potentially get a slightly better price, but there's a good chance you'll end up buying from John, which is more expensive. It's better to accept the offer and save the time and risk."
