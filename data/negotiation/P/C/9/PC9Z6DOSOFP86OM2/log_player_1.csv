Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Ensure a Sale:**  While you have a backup buyer, selling to Bob at $140 is significantly more profitable than John's $100 offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price that benefits both parties."
