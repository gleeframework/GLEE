Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $200. It's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high to give myself room to negotiate down.  While I'm willing to go lower, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $150 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know I have a guaranteed sale with John at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation with Bob when I can secure the $150 right now."
