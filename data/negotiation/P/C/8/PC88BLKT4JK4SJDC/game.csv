"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with great potential. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that reflects its value and allows you a good margin for profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the product's potential.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is still far below what I need to make this worthwhile. To be honest, I'm getting a much better offer from someone else. If you're truly serious, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know what you decide.",850000.0,Alice,5,
