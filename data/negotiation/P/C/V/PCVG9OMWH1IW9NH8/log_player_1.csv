"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price, it's too early to sell to John. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and we are already in round 4. If I reject this offer, it's likely that we'll continue to haggle back and forth, potentially wasting time and risking a lower final price.  While $7,500 is still below my ideal, it's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can find a way to make up the difference elsewhere."
