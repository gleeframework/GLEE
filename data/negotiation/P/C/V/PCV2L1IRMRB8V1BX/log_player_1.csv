Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and express confidence in the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $140. I'm willing to continue the negotiation for now, but I'll keep an eye on John's offer if things don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $135? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $135. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $130 is still a decent profit for me and it's a good compromise."
