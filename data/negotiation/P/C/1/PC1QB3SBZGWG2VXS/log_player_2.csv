You're trying to save money, and $65 is still a bit more than you're willing to pay. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

While it's still a bit more than you'd like to pay, it's getting closer to your target price.  With only a few rounds left, it's probably a good idea to accept this offer to avoid the risk of not being able to negotiate further or ending up buying from John at a higher price."
