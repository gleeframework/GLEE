"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially save $200,000 by getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range.  This should encourage Alice to negotiate further, potentially leading to a deal closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth another round to see if you can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly, showing Alice you are serious about negotiating, while still leaving room for further discussion. This could lead to a compromise that is beneficial for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, the negotiation with Alice seems to be getting stuck. You have already made two counteroffers, and Alice is still not willing to come down to a price you're comfortable with. It's likely that you won't be able to get a better deal with Alice. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $150,000 compared to Alice's offer."
