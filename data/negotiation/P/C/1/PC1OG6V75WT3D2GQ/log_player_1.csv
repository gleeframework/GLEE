"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to me.  Selling it for $9,000 would be a significant loss, and I'm not willing to take that risk yet.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,500. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
