"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to him, making it clear why he should consider this price. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. It's high enough to give me room to compromise if necessary, but not so high that it immediately turns Bob off. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While I'm open to negotiation, dropping to $750,000 is a significant reduction from my starting point and is below the product's minimum value to me. 
* **I have room to negotiate.**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup option, but not yet optimal.**  I'd prefer to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's the only one with the potential to offer a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price that still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $900,000 to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not cave in to his initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will still receive at $850,000.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to show a willingness to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still leaving some room for future concessions if necessary.  I'm aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement without jeopardizing my minimum price requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum price.**  He's offering $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **Closing the deal is beneficial.**  Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation rounds.
* **Selling to John is not necessary.**  While I could sell to John for the same price, Bob is the preferred buyer as he has shown interest and a willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient and profitable option at this point. It ensures I receive my minimum desired price while avoiding the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
