``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. 
* If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds.
* If he accepts, great! I've secured a higher price than my minimum. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll consider selling to John for my minimum price to avoid losing out completely."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate:** There's no need to rush into a deal that is not in my favor.
* **I can counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal:** I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob if I counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price between Bob's offer of $1,200,000 and my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Reasoning behind the counteroffer:**  I'll consider factors like Bob's interest, the remaining rounds, and the potential for a better deal.
* **If necessary, I'll consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob fails:**  But my priority is to get the best possible price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's split the difference:  I'll offer you the product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle of Bob's offer ($1,400,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This shows I'm serious about closing a deal and willing to compromise.

* **Encouraging action:**  I use a question to prompt Bob's response and move the negotiation forward.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I will assess his reaction to the counteroffer and consider if he is likely to accept or counteroffer again.
* **Prepare for further counteroffers (if necessary):** I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer, but I'm hoping this compromise will seal the deal.
* **Consider selling to John as a backup:** If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

* **Prepare to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for $1,500,000 to avoid losing out completely.  However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal with Bob, as his previous offers indicate he's genuinely interested."

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though he's shown increasing willingness to pay, his offer is still $200,000 below my minimum.
* **I can secure my minimum:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000, which is better than risking a lower offer from Bob.
* **Negotiation is stalled:**  Bob's continued rejections indicate that a deal with him is unlikely.

**Next steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I will accept John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal.
