"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it establishes my firm limit and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my limit, it's still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want to get a good deal.  It's a reasonable compromise that might be more appealing to her than the $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to my limit, it's still a significant amount more than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to continue to gradually increase my offer, but still stay below my maximum budget.  $10,000 is a good compromise and shows Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has dropped her price, it's still too high for me.  I've reached my limit for negotiation, and I'm not comfortable going higher. I've spent six rounds trying to reach a deal with Alice, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $8,000."
