"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay in one step.  You should reject this offer and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my price range. I could consider something closer to $6,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $6,000, you're anchoring the negotiation much lower. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but sets a firm starting point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer leaves space for counteroffers. You can gradually increase your price if needed, aiming to meet somewhere between $6,000 and your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind, you can always walk away and buy from John for $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your position, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice lowered her price, but $17,000 is still too high and well outside your budget. It seems like Alice is negotiating down slowly.  You should continue the negotiation by making another counteroffer.  There's still a chance to reach a price that works for you before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer shows I'm serious about buying but need to be mindful of my budget."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to $11,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Justification:** By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" you're appealing to a sense of fairness while still staying significantly below Alice's current offer.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** While not stated directly, you're reminding Alice that you have the option of John's $8,000 offer. This adds a subtle pressure to the negotiation without explicitly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. However,  $11,000 is still quite a way off from what I need for this. How about we settle at $14,000? That's me really trying to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $14,000 is still significantly above your $8,000 limit. At this stage, it's worth pushing a bit further. She's shown a willingness to negotiate, so you might be able to bring the price down closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  My absolute maximum budget for this product is $12,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to make the deal."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're presenting $12,000 as your best and final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and signals to Alice that you're serious about buying but won't go any higher.
* **Walking Away Point:**  $12,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's $8,000 price. If Alice rejects this offer, it's probably time to walk away and accept John's deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:** You're maintaining a positive and respectful tone throughout the negotiation, increasing the chances of a successful outcome."
