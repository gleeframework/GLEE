"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my price range. I could consider something closer to $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I understand your position, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This offer shows I'm serious about buying but need to be mindful of my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. However,  $11,000 is still quite a way off from what I need for this. How about we settle at $14,000? That's me really trying to make this work.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  My absolute maximum budget for this product is $12,000.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to make the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
