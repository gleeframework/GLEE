{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is less than the $12,000 from John, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further with Alice.  There's room for both sides to compromise, and rejecting the first offer allows for that negotiation to begin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving some room for compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

{""product_price"": 9000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, her offer is still higher than Bob's maximum.  With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to secure a better deal.  Rejecting this offer will allow him to continue negotiating for a more favorable price."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Bob has to make a decision.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's desired price point, and it's unlikely she will go lower in the final round. Buying from John, although more expensive, guarantees Bob will secure the product.  It's a risk-averse decision that ensures he gets the product within his budget."
