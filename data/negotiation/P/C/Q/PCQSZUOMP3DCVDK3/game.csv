"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.

"Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can consider. This product has generated substantial interest, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to my budget at $1,300,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. However, I'm motivated to make a deal with you.  If you're willing to come up to $1,375,000, I'm prepared to agree to those terms today.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
