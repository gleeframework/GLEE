"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your initial thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" the message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the tone collaborative and open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, allowing space for concessions throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, which is a good sign. However, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to bring the price closer to your target. Selling to John is a last resort option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can consider. This product has generated substantial interest, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing you've considered his proposal helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Standing Firm on Value:**  Reiterating the product's worth and demand reinforces your position without being confrontational.
* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping the price by $150,000 signals a willingness to move towards a deal but keeps the offer substantially above Bob's initial offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Framing the counteroffer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counter-concession."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose a price closer to my budget at $1,300,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating within a range that is above your guaranteed sale price with John. However, there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob. You've only used four rounds, and Bob's offer increments suggest he might be willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To be frank, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. However, I'm motivated to make a deal with you.  If you're willing to come up to $1,375,000, I'm prepared to agree to those terms today."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  Acknowledge Bob's understanding of the product's value and his negotiation style to build rapport.
* **Firm but Fair:** While stating $1,300,000 is too low, you express a strong desire to close the deal, implying this is a final offer.
* **Strategic Concession:** The counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and your previous one, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Time Pressure:** By introducing a sense of urgency (""prepared to agree to those terms today""), you encourage Bob to make a decision without dragging out the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. This is an attempt to find a middle ground between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,325,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Extended negotiations can be draining. Accepting a good offer now avoids potential impasses or Bob lowering his offer later. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting secures a substantial profit now."
