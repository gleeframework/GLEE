"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer represents a substantial discount and reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
