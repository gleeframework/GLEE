"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $110, which is closer to my budget and hopefully still allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",110.0,Bob,4,
