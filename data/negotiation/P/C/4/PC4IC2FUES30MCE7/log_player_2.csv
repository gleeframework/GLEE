"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $140. This is an excellent chance to acquire a valuable asset at a discount. Please let me know if you're interested in securing this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $140, which is $10 less than what John is asking.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:**  Even though Alice is selling at a discount, the product is still worth $150 to Bob. This means Bob can still make a profit (or at least get a good deal) by accepting Alice's offer."
