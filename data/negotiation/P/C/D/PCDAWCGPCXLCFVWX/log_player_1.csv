"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. $1,000,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it's also a starting point that gives me leverage. I'll be prepared to adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below my initial asking price. I'm confident I can do better, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to my desired price. I've already rejected him twice, and while I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he might walk away.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and a sale."
