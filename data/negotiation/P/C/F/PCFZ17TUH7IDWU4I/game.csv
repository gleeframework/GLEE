"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $145 is still a bit high for me.  How about $135? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference - how about $140? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $135.  It's the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
