"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $160 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason: Bob's goal is to get the product for $120 or less. Alice's initial offer of $160 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason: Alice's offer of $145 is still higher than Bob's target of $120. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $145 is still a bit high for me.  How about $135? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference - how about $140? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Reason:  While $140 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $120. There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $135.  It's the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
