"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. My initial offer was based on the product's value and market conditions. I am unable to match $8,500. However, I am open to discussing other terms or finding a middle ground that respects the product's worth. Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like to consider.",9200.0,Alice,3,

Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to discuss further.",8950.0,Alice,5,
