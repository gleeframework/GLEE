"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. This is a rare chance to own something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While meeting halfway sounds reasonable on the surface, it's important to stand firm at this stage.  I'll counter in the next round with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  Would you consider $1,300,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

I've decided to make a more reasonable counteroffer, moving down slightly from my initial price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying firm on a price that's closer to the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now negotiating more realistically, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm aiming for a higher final number, but I need to be careful not to push him away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,200,000 is close, but it's important we reach an agreement that feels fair to both sides.  How about we split the difference -  $1,250,000, and we have a deal?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

I'm aiming for a middle ground here. This counter-offer shows Bob I'm willing to compromise for a swift deal, while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  This ""splitting the difference"" tactic often feels like a win-win to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to try to get closer to my original target. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tough decision point. Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation but is trying to draw me closer to his target price.  While $1,150,000 is tempting, I still believe the product is worth more, and I have some leverage with John's offer. I'll reject this and propose a final offer to see if Bob is willing to budge a bit more.  We're getting close to the point where I may have to consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's make this simple: $1,200,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

I'm making a final offer that leans more toward Bob's side but is still above my guaranteed sale price. Presenting it as a final offer adds weight and encourages a decision.  This leaves the next move to Bob, and I'm prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and my original offer of $750,000. Would you consider $1,025,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet my price point, and his latest offer is too close to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to walk away. Selling to John ensures I get the product's value without further negotiation and potential losses.  It's been a pleasure, Bob, but I'm going to move forward with another buyer."
