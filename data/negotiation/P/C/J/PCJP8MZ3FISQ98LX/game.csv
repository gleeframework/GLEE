"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my own valuation.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a more reasonable price point.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
