"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a fair starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower counteroffer than Bob's last one, hoping to meet him halfway. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is a good deal. It's very close to my desired price point and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
