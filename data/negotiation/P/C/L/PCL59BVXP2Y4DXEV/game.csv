"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price that's closer to what I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your offer of $700000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $900000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $820000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. Considering your offer of $820000, I'm willing to reduce my price to $850000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being slightly more affordable.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $810000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",810000.0,Bob,6,
