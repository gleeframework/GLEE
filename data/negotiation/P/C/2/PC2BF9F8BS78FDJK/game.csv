"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can go as high as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay.,97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $97.50 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise at $102.50. This way we both get a fair deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $102.50. How about we meet at $95? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay.,95.0,Bob,6,
