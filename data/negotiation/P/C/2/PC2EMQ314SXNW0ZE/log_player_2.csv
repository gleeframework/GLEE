"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. By rejecting, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John, achieving the same outcome at the same price.  The goal is to save money, and rejecting allows for that possibility."
