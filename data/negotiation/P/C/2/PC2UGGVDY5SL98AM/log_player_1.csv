Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific. This allows Bob to potentially justify the high price in his own mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept or move to John."
