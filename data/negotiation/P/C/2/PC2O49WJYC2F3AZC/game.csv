"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $8,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Okay, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,800?  That's a good middle ground for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $8,800 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,000, like my initial offer? It's a fair price, and I think it's worth it for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
