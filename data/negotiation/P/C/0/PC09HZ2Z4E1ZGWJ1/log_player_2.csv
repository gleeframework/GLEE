Round 3

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm sticking to my initial assessment of the product's value to me.  I'll counteroffer again."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $14,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I want to see if she's willing to come down even further before considering accepting.  I'll try one more counteroffer."
