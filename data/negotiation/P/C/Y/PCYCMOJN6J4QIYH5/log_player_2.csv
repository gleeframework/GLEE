"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  You know you can buy the product from John for the same price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000 immediately demonstrates your desire to negotiate and potentially saves you a significant amount of money.  This forces Alice to either accept a lower price or counter with a higher one, providing valuable information about her desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than your initial counteroffer.  There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows you to continue exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but not drastically. This counteroffer is a moderate increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve a lower price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without appearing overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched your counteroffer from round 4. This is a good deal for you as you are able to buy the product for $1,500 less than John's price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you money.  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower in future rounds, and you risk losing the deal or running out of rounds."
