{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where you can likely negotiate further.  You're aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price sets the stage for a negotiation. $750,000 is a substantial drop from $850,000, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give you a starting point for further negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but it's still too high.  You are trying to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the process and try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 775000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, you're still within the realm of being able to negotiate a better price. You're only $40,000 away from your ideal price range. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations going and increases the pressure on Alice to make a more attractive deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for. With only 3 rounds left, the time pressure increases, but you still have room to negotiate. Rejecting her offer keeps the possibility of getting a lower price alive."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final push towards a deal.  With only two rounds left, you need to make a strong offer that Alice will likely accept.  $800,000 is still a good deal for you, saving you $200,000 compared to John's offer.  It's also a very small difference from Alice's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations. You have two choices: accept Alice's offer of $805,000 or buy from John for $1,000,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it saves you $195,000 compared to buying from John.  While you may have hoped for a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
