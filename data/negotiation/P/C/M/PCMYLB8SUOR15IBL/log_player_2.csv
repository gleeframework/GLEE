"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still quite high.  You know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you stand a chance of getting a better deal from her in a counter-offer, or you can always fall back on John's offer."
