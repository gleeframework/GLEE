"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is asking for $950,000, which is a significant markup from its value to her ($800,000). 
* You have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or you can proceed to buy from John. Either way, you're likely to save money compared to accepting the initial offer."
