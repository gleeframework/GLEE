"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer! I'm interested in the product, but $8,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $6,000? That would be a price point where I'm ready to move forward.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $7,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $6,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",7000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand $7,000 is your final offer, and it's definitely tempting. To be completely upfront, my budget limit is $6,750. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to thank you for your time and consider my other options.",6750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $7,000, but I'm also willing to throw in a premium service package worth $250. This will bring the total value to $7,250, which is still below your budget limit. I believe this is a fair compromise.",7250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, and that service package does sound valuable. However, my budget is really firm at $6,750 for the product itself. If you're unable to meet that price, I completely understand, but I wouldn't want to waste your time by continuing to negotiate.",6750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer it to you for $7,000, without the premium service package. This is my absolute lowest price, and I'm confident it's still a fair value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",7000.0,Alice,9,
