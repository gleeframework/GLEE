I've made my best attempt to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but it seems he's firm on his offer. Rather than continue negotiating and risk getting a lower price, I'll accept John's offer of $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount of money."
