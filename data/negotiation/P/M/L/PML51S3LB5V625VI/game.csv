"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for you to profit significantly, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about $1,275,000? This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's close this deal. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
