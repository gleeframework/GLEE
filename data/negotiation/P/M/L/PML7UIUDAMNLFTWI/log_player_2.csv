You can try to get a better price from Alice.  $120 is still a bit high for you, considering your maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

You're still slightly above your target price, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112 is still a bit more than you initially wanted, it's close to your budget and Alice is likely to be firm at this point. It's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of her going back up to $115 or you having to buy from John for $150."
