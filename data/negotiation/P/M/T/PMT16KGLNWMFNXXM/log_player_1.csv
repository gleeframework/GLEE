Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, highlighting the ""value and potential"" might make him reconsider.
* **Alternative:** If you want to appear more flexible, you could phrase the message as an invitation to discuss price: 
    ```json
    {
    ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the first chance to purchase this valuable product.  I'm seeking a price in the range of $2,000,000, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for you."", 
    ""product_price"": 2000000
    }
    ```
    This approach might encourage Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially higher sale price."
