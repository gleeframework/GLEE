This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a significant profit.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so any price below that is a loss for him.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $15,000, so I want to sell it for as close to that amount as possible.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $14,500 gives Bob a $2,500 discount and me a profit of $4,500. This is a good middle ground that is likely to be appealing to Bob.

By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I create an incentive for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I can confidently move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum asking price."
