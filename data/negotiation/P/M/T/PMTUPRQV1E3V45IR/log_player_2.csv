"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us. You value it at $10,000, and I'm willing to let it go for less than that. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than your maximum value of $10,000.  While you could get the product for the same price from John, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500."
