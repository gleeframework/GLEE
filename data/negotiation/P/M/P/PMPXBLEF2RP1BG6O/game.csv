"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $92.50 for the product. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $92.50 is still a bit out of my range. How about $87.50?  That's halfway between our last two offers.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $87.50, Bob. I can do $91 for the product. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit.",91.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $91 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. If you're open to this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",89.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit impatient, Bob, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. I can do $90.50 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",90.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're getting impatient, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there. How about $89.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good way to close the deal.",89.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to budge much more, Bob. I can do $90.75 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, so let me know if you're interested.",90.75,Alice,9,
