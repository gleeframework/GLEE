While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $92.50 for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $92.50 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. You have more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $92.50 is still a bit out of my range. How about $87.50?  That's halfway between our last two offers."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $87.50, Bob. I can do $91 for the product. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $91 is still above your ideal price point. You have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to continue working towards a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $91 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $89 for the product. If you're open to this price, I think we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, Bob, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. I can do $90.50 for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's final offer of $90.50 is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. You have a few more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows you to continue haggling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're getting impatient, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not quite there. How about $89.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good way to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 89.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to budge much more, Bob. I can do $90.75 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While it's still a bit above your ideal price point, it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $100. There's only one round left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you from having to buy from John."
