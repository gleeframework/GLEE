"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your value and still within my budget.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
