"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the middle ground between my minimum value ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a good price for me, and it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $10,500, Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we're already in round 4. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
