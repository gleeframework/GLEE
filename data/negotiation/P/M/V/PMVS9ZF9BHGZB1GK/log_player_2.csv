{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2

{""product_price"": 850000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  He can continue to aim for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, he can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure an even better deal."
