"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows for a win-win scenario.  This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but also less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving him room to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  This compromise shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also maintains a significant profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  We're nearing the middle ground, and with limited rounds left,  accepting this offer ensures a profit without risking a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a deal with John at a lower price."
