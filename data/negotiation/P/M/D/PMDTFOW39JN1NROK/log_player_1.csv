Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, considering your potential interest.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is designed to be friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the potential value to Bob without revealing my minimum price.
* **Product Price:** I'm offering the product at $900,000. This is a price that is still higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to earn more than what John would pay. 

By offering a price that is slightly below my minimum value, I create a situation where:

* **If Bob accepts:** I get a better price than I would with John.
* **If Bob rejects:** I still have a guaranteed sale with John, ensuring I reach my minimum target."
