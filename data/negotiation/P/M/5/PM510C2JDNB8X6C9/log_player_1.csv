Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while ensuring I get more than John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
