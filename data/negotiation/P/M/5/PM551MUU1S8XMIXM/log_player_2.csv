"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is under your $100 limit, you can potentially get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for her to potentially counter with a lower price.  If her next offer is too high, you can always buy from John for $100."
