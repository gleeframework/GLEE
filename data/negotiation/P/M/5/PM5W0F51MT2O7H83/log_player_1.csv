"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle - what about $16,500?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so how about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
