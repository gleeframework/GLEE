"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle - what about $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so how about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
