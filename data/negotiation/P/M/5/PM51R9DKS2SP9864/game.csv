"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1050000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
