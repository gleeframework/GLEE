Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation while leaving a substantial profit margin.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing a deal with Bob quickly might be more beneficial than waiting for the guaranteed sale to John."
