"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and your offer is appreciated. However, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000, reflecting the value I place on this product and the potential benefits it offers you. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact you're willing to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000,  which reflects the value of this product and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
