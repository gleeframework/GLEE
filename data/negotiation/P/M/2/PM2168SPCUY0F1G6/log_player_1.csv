Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects a fair offer for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to potentially get the best possible price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob tries to negotiate down, there's a good chance you'll land a price higher than your $10,000 minimum.
* **Consider Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000, so a price slightly lower than that might be very enticing to him while still netting you a significant profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a higher price makes it a calculated risk."
