"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $650000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $670000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.
