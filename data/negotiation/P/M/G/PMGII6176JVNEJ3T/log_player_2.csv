Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is still too high.  I understand your budget, so I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This product is truly worth the investment, and I'm confident you'll see a great return.  What do you say?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for working with me.  While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $12,000? That would be a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your patience.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and would like to close this deal with you. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is my final offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  That's a fair offer considering your other buyer and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter, but I need to be firm on this. $15,000 is my absolute lowest price - I'm practically giving it away at this point! This is your chance to secure a valuable product at a steal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $15,000.  While she claims it's a steal, you have a firm budget and a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a low probability of reaching your desired price range.  Buying from John ensures you stay within budget."
