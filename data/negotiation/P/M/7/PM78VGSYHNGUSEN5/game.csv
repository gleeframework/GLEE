,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and $10,000 is below its worth.  To make this work, I could come down to $13,500. This offer reflects the product's true value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
