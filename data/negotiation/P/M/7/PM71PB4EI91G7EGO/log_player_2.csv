"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,450,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's crucial to start negotiating to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my maximum, I can still try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer to try and get closer to my target."
