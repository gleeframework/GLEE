"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still too high.  You can likely negotiate a better price. It's worth trying to get closer to your target price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm confident I can leverage it to my advantage."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I know the true value of this product goes beyond even your initial assessment.  I could meet you halfway from our previous offers at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your budget.  You're at risk of losing the deal to other buyers if you keep pushing for a lower price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product and saves you from having to pay John's higher price."
