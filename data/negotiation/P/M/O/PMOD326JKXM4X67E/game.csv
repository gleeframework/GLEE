"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm looking to get the best deal possible, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I value your interest, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",10750.0,Bob,4,
