Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, it doesn't leave me any room for profit. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price.  I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me while remaining appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price or a prolonged negotiation isn't worth it.  I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, which is my minimum value and ensures I don't lose money."
