Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $950,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob will get, encouraging him to accept.
* **Option to Sell to John:**  Having the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. If Bob rejects my offer, I know I have a solid alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to receive. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is currently the best option. However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, so I'll counteroffer.  The goal is to inch closer to my desired price, even if it's just a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $900,000 is a compromise that is closer to my minimum value and closer to Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message remains positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob and emphasizes a ""middle ground"" approach.
* **Option to Sell to John:** I'm still keeping the option of selling to John in mind. This is a crucial element for my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired price.  At this point, I've already made a significant concession and Bob doesn't seem willing to move much further.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired profit, and it's time to cut my losses with Bob."
