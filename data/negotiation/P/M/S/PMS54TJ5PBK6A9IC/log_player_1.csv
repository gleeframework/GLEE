Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's worth to me and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

This price is still a significant discount from your original offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.
