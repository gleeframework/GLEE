"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,600,000. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's worth to me and the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $900,000 and my valuation is substantial.  To move this negotiation forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value and potential of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still believe that $1,400,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price is still a significant discount from your original offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
