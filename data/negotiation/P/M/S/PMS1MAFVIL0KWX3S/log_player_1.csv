Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $16,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 16000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $14,000 is still a little too low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $14,500.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
