"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe the value you'll get from this product will far outweigh the cost. Let me know your thoughts!
