"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still offers you a significant value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're not quite on the same page yet. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a significant discount and keeps the deal mutually beneficial.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. $900,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work towards a final agreement.",925000.0,Alice,7,
