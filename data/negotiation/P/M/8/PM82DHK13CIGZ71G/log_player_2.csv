"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate, but you need to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still offers you a significant value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You should continue to negotiate for a lower price. It's likely Alice is willing to go lower as she rejected your counteroffer in the previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing we're not quite on the same page yet. While I value your interest, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives you a significant discount and keeps the deal mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your maximum of $800,000. You should continue to negotiate and see if you can push her further down. There's still room to bargain, and you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. $900,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be closer to my desired price point.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This represents a significant discount for you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work towards a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to negotiate, her offer of $925,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have a limited number of rounds left, and there's a risk that Alice won't budge any further. To avoid the potential of losing out on a good deal with John, it's best to take the guaranteed offer of $800,000."
