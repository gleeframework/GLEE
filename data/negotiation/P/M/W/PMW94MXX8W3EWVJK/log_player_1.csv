Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, Alice gets a great deal. If he rejects it, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
