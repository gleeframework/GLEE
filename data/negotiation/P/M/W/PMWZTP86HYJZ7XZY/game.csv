"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This reflects its worth while still leaving room for a beneficial deal on your end.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  To be honest, I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be a fair price. I need to stay within a reasonable range for me.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  However, the value this product brings is substantial.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
