Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and direct, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm starting high, leaving space for negotiation. 
* **Encourage Bob to engage:**  By being friendly and highlighting the value, I hope to make Bob more likely to counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By being clear about my minimum acceptable price (implied by my willingness to sell to John), I'm establishing boundaries."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.  It's better to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we compromise at $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer. This shows willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that's closer to my target.
* **Message:**  I'm being polite and understanding while reiterating the value for Bob.  This emphasizes that I'm aiming for a fair deal, not just trying to squeeze every dollar out of him.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but not drastically.
* **Keep leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but offering a counter-proposal that's more reasonable for me.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  This counteroffer is likely to lead to another round of negotiation, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit too high. I could go up to $950,000. That's a significant offer, and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, continuing to go back and forth with Bob at this point is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's more advantageous to accept John's offer, ensuring a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
