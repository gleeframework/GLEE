"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1500000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a significant purchase. I'm excited about the opportunity to work with you, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1050000 is the maximum I can stretch to. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a significant purchase. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
