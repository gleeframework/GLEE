"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my own goals.  Let's see if we can find common ground!",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $10,500 for the product?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,625? This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to continue the negotiations with you.  Let's try to reach an agreement!",10625.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer. Would you be willing to lower the price to $10,400? It's still above my budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay.",10400.0,Bob,6,
