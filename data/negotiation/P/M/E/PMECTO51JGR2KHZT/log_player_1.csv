Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Consider the Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $10,000. Offering it to Bob at $11,500 gives me a chance to earn an extra $1,500."
