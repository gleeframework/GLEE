Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's a strong initial offer:**  A bold offer can sometimes push the buyer to accept quickly.

However, be prepared to negotiate!  Bob might counteroffer, and you'll need to decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a decent amount, it's still below the price I initially offered.  I believe I can get closer to my goal of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price of $14,000, and it's still a good deal for me considering John is willing to pay $10,000.  It's time to accept and finalize the sale."
