"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is above my minimum acceptable value and a good compromise.  It's also getting late in the negotiations, so accepting this offer seems like the best course of action."
