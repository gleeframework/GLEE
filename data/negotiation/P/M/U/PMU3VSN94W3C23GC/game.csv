"Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my ideal price and a significant value for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,4,
