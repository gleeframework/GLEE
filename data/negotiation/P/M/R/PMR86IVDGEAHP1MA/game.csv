"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested parties.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still out of my price range. To be frank, I'm very close to purchasing this product from John for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to move closer to my price.  It's clear we both recognize the value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Remember, I'm very serious about buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant move on my part.  This is truly my final offer, and it's up to you whether we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
