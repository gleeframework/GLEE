Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still out of my price range. To be frank, I'm very close to purchasing this product from John for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's make this happen.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
