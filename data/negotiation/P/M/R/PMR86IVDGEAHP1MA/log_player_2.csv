"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as I already have other interested parties.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,650,000 is still out of my price range. To be frank, I'm very close to purchasing this product from John for $1,200,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to move closer to my price.  It's clear we both recognize the value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Remember, I'm very serious about buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant move on my part.  This is truly my final offer, and it's up to you whether we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
