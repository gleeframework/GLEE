Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This reflects my genuine interest and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
