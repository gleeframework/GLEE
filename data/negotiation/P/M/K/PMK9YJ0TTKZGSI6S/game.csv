"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This reflects my genuine interest and allows for a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1400000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1500000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
