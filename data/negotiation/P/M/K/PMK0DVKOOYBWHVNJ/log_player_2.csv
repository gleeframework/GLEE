"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $130 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his own valuation of the product. By offering $110, he's showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $120, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.  Accepting the offer is a good decision since Bob has already rejected one counteroffer and there is no guarantee he can get a lower price in the next round. It's better to secure a good deal than risk missing out completely."
