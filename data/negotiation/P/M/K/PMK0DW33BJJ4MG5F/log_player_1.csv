"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  We have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However,  $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,500? I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is tempting, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe we can still close the deal at a higher price. With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, $9,500 is a good deal, especially considering we only have 4 rounds left.  It's much better than selling to John for $8,000."
