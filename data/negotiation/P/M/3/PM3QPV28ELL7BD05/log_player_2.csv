{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $400 over your budget, and you only have 3 rounds left.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially running out of time to make a deal.  It's best to secure the product from John at your maximum budget of $12,000."
