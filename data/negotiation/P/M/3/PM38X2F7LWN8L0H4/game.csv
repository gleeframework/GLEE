"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit too high for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $600000. This is a fair price given the potential value of the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $750000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the initial offer I made. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $750000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer.  Let's try $700000. This is a solid middle ground, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $725000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
