"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets by highlighting the difference between my offer and the product's worth to him.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  He acknowledged the product's worth to me, which gives me leverage.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John for $80 would be a missed opportunity, as I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By not accepting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and am confident in the product's value.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob by emphasizing the deal he's getting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $105? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a good price.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 4, leaving fewer rounds to negotiate."
