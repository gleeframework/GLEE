Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I can't go lower than $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9200}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,800 is still too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've also only got 2 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
