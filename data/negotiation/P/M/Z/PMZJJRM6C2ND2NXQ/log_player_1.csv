Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob, considering the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point. While I could try to squeeze out another $500, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale, and it's better to secure $9,500 than risk losing the deal and ending up with only $8,000 from John."
