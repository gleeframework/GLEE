Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  For a deal to happen, the price needs to be between $1,000,001 (so Bob profits) and $1,499,999 (so Alice profits).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim for the higher end of the zone of agreement.  Since Bob doesn't know about John, Alice has leverage. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I've had significant interest from other parties."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting high sets a strong point in the negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other parties"" creates a fear of missing out.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  While aiming high, Alice leaves space to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might counter-offer, or walk away. If that happens, Alice has her backup plan with John."
