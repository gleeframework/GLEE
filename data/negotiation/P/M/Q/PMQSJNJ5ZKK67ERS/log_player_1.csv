Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have another buyer (John) as a safety net.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare Bob away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a competitive offer for an asset I know you'll find beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident, yet friendly and professional.
* **Price Justification:**  Subtly implying the product's value without explicitly stating Bob's maximum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $150,000 gap allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still keeping you well above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to anticipate counter-offers.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have John as a backup, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob can be beneficial for future deals."
