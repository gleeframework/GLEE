Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price could result in a quicker sale and still net a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is above Bob's perceived value of $120, but low enough to potentially entice him. It leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Time Value:** Selling quickly to Bob avoids potential delays in finding another buyer if I went straight to John."
