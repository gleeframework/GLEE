"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider $12,000 for the product?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
