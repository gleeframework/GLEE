,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. How about $8,500?  That's a good compromise, and still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $7,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
