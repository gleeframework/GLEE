"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $9,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which is $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
