"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved up to $9,500, which is only $500 away from my desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. There's also a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away or offer an even lower price."
