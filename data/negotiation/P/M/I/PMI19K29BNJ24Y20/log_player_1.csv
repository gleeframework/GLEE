Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go above $13,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not budging from my original offer. Can you consider $13,000?

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would prefer to get more, Bob is being stubborn and the rounds are dwindling. Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I at least meet my minimum goal, and it's better than risking losing the deal entirely."
