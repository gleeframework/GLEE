"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, given the value you place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm really not willing to go above $13,000. I'd be happy to meet you at $13,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,250 is closer, I'm still hoping to get $13,750 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on it.  What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,5,,
