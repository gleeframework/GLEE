,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $170. This is the lowest I can go.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165?",165.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $167. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",167.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $167 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $165.50. Can you consider this price?",165.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $167, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a small profit, so I'll offer it to you for $166.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",166.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a small profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $166.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $165.75. Can you consider this price?",165.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you halfway multiple times, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the product's minimum value for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make it worth my while. I'll offer it to you for $166. I'm not going any lower than that.",166.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $166. I've already gone as low as I can, so I'm going to have to walk away from the deal. I'll consider buying the product from John for $150 instead.",150.0,Bob,10,
