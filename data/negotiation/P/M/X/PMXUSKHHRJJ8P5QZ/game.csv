"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. It's a good price, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. Let me know if you can meet me in the middle.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $130. How about we split the difference and meet at $135? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $130, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Let's meet in the middle again at $133.75.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",133.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $131.25. Can you consider this offer?",131.25,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $132.50, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think that I may need to sell to John, but I'm giving you one last chance to make a deal.",132.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $132, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",132.0,Bob,8,
