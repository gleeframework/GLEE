"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. This price is significantly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. This will allow us to settle on a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,300,000 is a good middle ground, and I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am getting anxious about the dwindling rounds, I'm confident I can get a better price if I counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm making a significant concession, but $1,250,000 is still a good profit.  It's clear Bob is very price-sensitive, so this offer might be enough to close the deal.  If he rejects, it's getting risky to keep negotiating, and I might have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. With only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time and leverage. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
