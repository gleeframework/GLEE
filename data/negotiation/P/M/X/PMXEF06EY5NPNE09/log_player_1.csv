Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Friendly opening:** I'm starting with a friendly greeting and a positive statement about the product. This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Direct and clear offer:** I'm clearly stating my offer and the price, leaving no room for confusion.

**Next steps:**

* I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. 
* If he rejects the offer, I will consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I will keep John's offer of $80 in mind as my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable value of $80. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I'll aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob, but also profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $85, which is closer to my minimum acceptable value and still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing Bob with a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and the fair profit margin for me. 

**Next steps:**

I will observe Bob's response to my counteroffer. I'm ready to either accept his offer if it's closer to my minimum or make another counteroffer if needed."
