"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $85 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $75.  Would you consider $80? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
