I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still ensuring a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering my fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and even lower than what John is offering. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to give away the product for a low price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a more reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering a price significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it seems like further negotiation with Bob won't lead to a satisfactory outcome.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum target."
