"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but $1,150,000 is still a significant amount over your ideal price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's a $150,000 difference between her minimum and your maximum.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You can always go to John if the negotiation with Alice fails.

**Next Steps:** You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** This counteroffer represents a $50,000 decrease from Alice's initial price. 
* **Reasonable starting point:** This price is still above Alice's value, indicating you're willing to negotiate but not giving away your entire margin. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to make a counteroffer back, allowing for a potentially mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price and leaves a significant margin for negotiation.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have already successfully negotiated a lower price and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.** You have a guaranteed alternative, so you can afford to be patient and continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:** Make another counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your ideal price point. You can try a counteroffer slightly higher than your previous offer, perhaps at $1,125,000,  demonstrating your willingness to compromise but still pushing for a better deal."

{""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase from previous offer:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Staying below Alice's counteroffer:** It shows you're taking her counteroffer seriously, but not accepting it outright.

* **Room for further negotiation:** It leaves space for Alice to potentially make a counteroffer closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** This means there's no further room for negotiation with her.
* **John offers the same price.**  You can buy from John at the same price you would pay Alice, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice leading to an even higher price.
* **No point in further negotiation.** Alice has shown she's unwilling to budge significantly, and further negotiation would likely be time-consuming and unproductive.

**Conclusion:**  Buying from John is the most logical decision as it guarantees you the product at your maximum price point without the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
