Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000?  It's still a fair price for you, and it would make the deal work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
