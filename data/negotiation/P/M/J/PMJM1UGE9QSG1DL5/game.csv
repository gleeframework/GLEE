"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,250? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $10,250. My final offer is $10,750.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. ",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,600, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept",10600.0,Bob,6,
