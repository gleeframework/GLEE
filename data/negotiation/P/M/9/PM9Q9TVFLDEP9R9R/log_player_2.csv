"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $14,000. I think it would be a valuable addition to your assets. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for Alice to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a compromise, and we both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $13,000 is better than $14,000, he's still willing to pay a bit more for the product. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before accepting the offer or buying from John."
