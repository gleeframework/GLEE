"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $12,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a compromise, and we both walk away happy.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
