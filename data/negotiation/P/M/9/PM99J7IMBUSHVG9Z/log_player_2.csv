# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm glad to hear that we're making progress. Considering the value you place on the product and our ongoing discussions, I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,095,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and ensures a satisfactory outcome for both of us.

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting at $1,095,000 is a good deal, saving a significant amount compared to John's $1,500,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate risks either running out of rounds or forcing us to accept a less favorable deal as time pressure increases."
