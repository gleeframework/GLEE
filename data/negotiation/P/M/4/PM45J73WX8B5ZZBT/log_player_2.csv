"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price than $100 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a reasonable compromise between Alice's asking price of $100 and my maximum budget of $120.  It shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
