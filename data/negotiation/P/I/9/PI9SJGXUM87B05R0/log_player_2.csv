"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to make an offer of $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell the product for. It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room:**  This counteroffer leaves a large gap between your price and Alice's, allowing for back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product but makes it clear you're serious about staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we aim for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $12,000 is still above both your budget and what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for moving closer to my budget.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're moving up from $8,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but the increase is still significant. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us closer to our budget and creates pressure on Alice. She knows you have the option to go with John for $10,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a polite and appreciative tone to encourage continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000. How about we aim for $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:**  Alice is strategically using the midpoint to her advantage. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $10,750.
* **John's offer is better:** You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a guaranteed saving of $750 compared to Alice's current offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  While you have more rounds, there's no guarantee Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile to continue. 

At this point, the sure savings with John outweigh the potential (but uncertain) savings of continuing with Alice."
