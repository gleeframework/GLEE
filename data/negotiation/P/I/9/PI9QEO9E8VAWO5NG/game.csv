"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'm proposing $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm willing to compromise, $9,800 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $10,100. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but $10,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and make a counteroffer of $9,900. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can you consider this offer?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,900 is a bit closer, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet at $10,050. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable deal.",10050.0,Alice,7,
