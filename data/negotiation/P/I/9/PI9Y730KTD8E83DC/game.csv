"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $11000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm happy to pay $9000 for this product.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this out.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $10200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
