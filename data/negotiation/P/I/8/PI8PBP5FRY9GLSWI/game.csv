"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $750,000 for the product?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This still leaves you with a good deal and gets us closer to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose $800,000 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and what you're asking.",800000.0,Bob,4,
