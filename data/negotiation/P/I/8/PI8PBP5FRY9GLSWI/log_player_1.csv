"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $800,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $800,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This still leaves you with a good deal and gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose $800,000 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and what you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me and secures the product at its true value. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer, or losing time and selling to John for the same price."
