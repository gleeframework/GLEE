"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $22,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your price point. How about we settle on $20,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",17500.0,Bob,4,
