"Alice, your product looks great, but I'm only willing to pay $15000. This is my maximum budget for this type of item. I'm hoping we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $17000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $16000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $16500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $16000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $16250, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,7,
