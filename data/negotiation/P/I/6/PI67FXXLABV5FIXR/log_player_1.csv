Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement quickly.
