Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between pushing for a higher price and leaving room for negotiation. 

Here's the logic:

* **$900,000 is more than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him a reason to negotiate and potentially accept. 
* **$900,000 is less than my minimum value:** This allows me to make concessions without feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response:** This builds rapport and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible, but also to keep Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm confident that I can get a higher offer from Bob by rejecting his counteroffer and making my own.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because my goal is to maximize my earnings, and that likely means getting closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of this product for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between my original offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Fair Value:**  $875,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, making it a fair deal for both of us.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to find a solution that works for both parties, keeping the negotiation open and positive. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still putting me in a strong position to get a better price than Bob's initial counteroffer."
