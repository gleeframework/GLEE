"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price of $1,200,000. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. There are still 9 rounds left, so you have plenty of time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to take that risk. Let's see if we can make a deal at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,200,000. While she is coming down, there is still room for negotiation. You can likely get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer. There are still 7 rounds left, so you have time to work towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive maintenance package, which will save you money in the long run. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product with added value. I'm still at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the added warranty and maintenance package are nice, the core price remains above your target price of $1,200,000. There are still 5 rounds left and you have time to see if you can negotiate a lower price.  You can try to counteroffer again, or potentially offer a trade-off -  accepting a slightly higher price in exchange for removing the warranty and maintenance package, for example."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added value you're providing. However,  I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product without the warranty and maintenance package. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to remove the warranty and maintenance package, but I need to make up for the lost value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000. You only have 3 rounds left to reach an agreement with Alice, and you may not be able to secure a better deal.  It's better to buy from John at this point and avoid further negotiations."
