"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's closer to his target price, Bob can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is a guaranteed deal within his budget.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
