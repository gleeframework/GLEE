"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $12000, which is the lowest I can go. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle after all. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $10800, but I'll throw in an extra incentive - I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,,
