"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** The message highlights ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price, even though we haven't specified what the product is.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gathering information about Bob's willingness to pay. His response will help shape your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is quite good, it's still below your $1,500,000 guarantee from John.  There's room for negotiation, and you haven't exhausted your rounds.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the door open for a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your budget limitations, the value this product brings to the table is truly exceptional.  I could consider coming down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant decrease from our initial offer, signaling flexibility but also emphasizing the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:** By staying well above both Bob's offer and your guaranteed price, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Justification:** The message continues to highlight the product's value to justify the high price. 
* **Observation:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,400,000 suggests he might value the product more than his initial offer implied.  We're still aiming to discover his true ceiling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the value and the market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer secures you a profit exceeding what you could get from John.  There's little reason to believe you could negotiate a significantly better deal with Bob at this point."
