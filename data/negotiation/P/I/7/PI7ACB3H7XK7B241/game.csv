,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $180, which is a significant discount from my original price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet at $180. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to my budget of $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really trying to get the product for a low price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $120. This is my best compromise so far, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're really trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $160, which is a $40 discount from my previous offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer that's a bit more aggressive. I can sell it to you for $140, which is my absolute minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. Is this a deal you're willing to do?",140.0,Alice,9,
