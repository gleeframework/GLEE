Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $75."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Alice is close to your target price, but you have a solid backup option.  John is willing to sell you the product for your target price of $80.  It's not worth risking more rounds of negotiation with Alice when you can secure the product now at your desired price from John."
