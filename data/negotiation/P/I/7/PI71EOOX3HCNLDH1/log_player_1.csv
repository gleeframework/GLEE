Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering at $20,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can decide to meet somewhere in the middle while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Quick Sale vs. Maximum Profit:** While you could try an even higher price, there's a chance Bob will reject outright. This offer balances the potential for a quick sale at a high profit with the certainty of selling to John at your minimum."
