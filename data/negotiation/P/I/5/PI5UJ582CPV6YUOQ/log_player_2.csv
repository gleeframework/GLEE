"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is below his maximum, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000 before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards Bob's target price of $1,200,000 while still being reasonable given Alice's valuation of $1,500,000. It signals Bob's serious interest in the product while also indicating his willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price, and with multiple rounds remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate. Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to compromise, and another counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his seriousness while still staying below his maximum.  This counteroffer is closer to his target price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting further away from Bob's target price.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down much further, and with several rounds left, Bob is at risk of running out of time and being stuck with a higher price.  Given John's price of $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's the most financially sensible option at this point."
