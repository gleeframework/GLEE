Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is a great value, but I'm on a budget. Here's my counteroffer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget concerns, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $18,000? That's a significant discount from my initial ask.
