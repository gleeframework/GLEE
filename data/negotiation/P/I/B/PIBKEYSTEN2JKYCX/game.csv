,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm asking for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $10,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while now.  I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next round.",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm really trying to be flexible. However, $10,625 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close this deal. If not, I may have to consider other options.",10750.0,Alice,7,
