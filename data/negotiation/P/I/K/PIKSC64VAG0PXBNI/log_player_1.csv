""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).

Offering the product at $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain. Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price allows you to potentially earn $125,000 more than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to an even higher final price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer and you'll get your guaranteed $800,000 from John. However, the potential to earn significantly more makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
