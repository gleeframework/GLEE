"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $14,000, and he knows Alice is willing to sell for less than $14,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13,500 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a price I can comfortably accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He's still hoping to get the product for closer to $13,500, and he has 7 more rounds to negotiate. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,600.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13600}
