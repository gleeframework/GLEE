"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13500 at this point. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a price I can comfortably accept."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13600.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,600 is very close to my last counteroffer of $13,750. Given that we are in round 4, and John is offering $12,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best option. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm likely to get a better price than John's offer."
