Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Limited time offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price alone. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you don't lose anything by attempting a higher price with Bob first."
