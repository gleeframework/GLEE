"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, and I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions or concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice, which could save you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than buying from John, and it's closer to Bob's desired price point. While there's always the chance Bob could get an even lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up buying from John at a much higher price is too high."
