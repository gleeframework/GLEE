"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
