Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also showing my willingness to negotiate.
