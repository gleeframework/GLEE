Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'll offer it to him for $15,000.

{""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Since Bob's offer is equal to the minimum value I'm willing to accept ($12,000), I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
