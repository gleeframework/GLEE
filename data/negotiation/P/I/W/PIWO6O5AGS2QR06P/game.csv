,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, while also being reasonable for both parties.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
