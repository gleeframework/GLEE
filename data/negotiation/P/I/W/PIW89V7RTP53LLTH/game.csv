"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $13,200? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price.",13200.0,Alice,5,
