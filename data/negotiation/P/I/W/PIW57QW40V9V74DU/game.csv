"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? I'd like to support your business, but I need to stay within my financial limits.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to support my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price further to $110? I believe this would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $115. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your effort in trying to meet my budget. However, I still feel that I am unable to commit to $115 at this time. I would like to propose a final offer of $110. I hope this will be acceptable, and I look forward to making a purchase.",110.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I can go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on this offer and explore other options. I think the product would be a great fit for someone who is willing to pay the true value of $120.",120.0,Alice,7,
