# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
