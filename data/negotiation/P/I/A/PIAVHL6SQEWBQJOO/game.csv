"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still unable to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1050000. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested in continuing our negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still valuing the product highly, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  While $950000 is getting closer, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price.  How about $1000000? This is a fair price, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
