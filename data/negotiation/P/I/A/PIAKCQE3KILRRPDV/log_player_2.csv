"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000.  This means you can save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though Alice's offer is above her value ($8,000), it's still a good deal for you.** You're getting a product you value highly for a price that's significantly lower than what you'd pay John."
