"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still fair given its value, and it would allow us both to close a profitable deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I could consider letting it go for $920,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that still reflects the significant benefits the product offers.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $880,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, this product is quite valuable, and I have other interested parties.  My final offer is $900,000. This allows us both to benefit significantly. Let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen.",890000.0,Bob,6,
