Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. $18,000 is still quite high for me. Would you consider $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is at his maximum:** Bob has stated that $10,000 is his final offer. This aligns with the information that the product is worth $10,000 to him.  It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer means losing out on $5,000. 
* **Time saved:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob might not yield a better outcome, and it consumes time and effort. Selling to John closes the deal quickly."
