Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy with the $1,500,000 value, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,750,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,625,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Can we meet at $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer my initial asking price,  $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my target and ensures a sale.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
