"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to me and your own bottom line, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my own expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
