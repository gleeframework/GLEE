Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially setting the price at $14,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $8,500 and unwilling to budge significantly.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me. Taking the guaranteed $10,000 from John is the best course of action now."
