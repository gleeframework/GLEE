"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial amount and demonstrates my serious interest.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",750000.0,Alice,5,
