Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This provides a buffer for potential counteroffers and ensures you don't immediately lose out on a better deal with John.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond accordingly. 

Remember, the goal is to find a balance between securing a good price and potentially reaching a deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's interest indicates there's potential for a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation and potentially reaching a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is too quick:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's no guarantee that you won't be able to get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price while still keeping the negotiation open. This counteroffer should be high enough to be attractive to Bob but low enough to leave room for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Value:** The message emphasizes the value Bob gets for the product at this price, encouraging him to consider it a good deal.
* **Openness:** The message keeps the negotiation open, suggesting a willingness to continue discussing and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a substantial amount and demonstrates my serious interest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $700,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Bob's continued interest and willingness to increase his offer indicates there's potential to reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is still premature:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000,  you can likely get a better price from Bob with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price but still acknowledges his increase. This counteroffer should be high enough to be attractive to Bob but low enough to leave room for further negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is exactly in the middle of your previous offer ($850,000) and Bob's current offer ($700,000).  
* **Demonstrating flexibility:**  This shows Bob that you are willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Staying above the minimum:** The counteroffer still keeps you above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Encouraging closure:** The message emphasizes finding a compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
