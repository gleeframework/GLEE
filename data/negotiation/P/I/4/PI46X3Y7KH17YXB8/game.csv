"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $15000 might be your limit. However, this product is truly special and worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $17500. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I respect that. However, $12000 is simply too low for this product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. How about we split the difference and settle on $14000?  I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $12000, and you've rejected it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $12000. I think we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to know if you're willing to sell it to me for $12000 or not. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10000.",12000.0,Bob,6,
