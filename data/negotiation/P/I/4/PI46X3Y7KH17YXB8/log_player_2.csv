Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but $20,000 is too steep. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $15000 might be your limit. However, this product is truly special and worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $17500. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is as high as I'm willing to go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I respect that. However, $12000 is simply too low for this product. It's a one-of-a-kind item, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. How about we split the difference and settle on $14000?  I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not willing to pay $14,000, and I don't think the product is worth that much more than my previous offer of $12,000. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm still not willing to pay more than $12,000. I'm starting to think that Alice is not serious about selling the product for a reasonable price. I'd like to make another counteroffer, but this time I'll try to be more direct.

{""message"": ""I've already offered you $12,000, and you've rejected it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. I think we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to know if you're willing to sell it to me for $12,000 or not. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
