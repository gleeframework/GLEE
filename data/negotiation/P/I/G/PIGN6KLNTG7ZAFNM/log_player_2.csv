"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired $1,000,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible. While Alice has come down a bit, $1,150,000 is still above his target. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make this deal work, I need to stay closer to my initial offer of $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a 5% discount from my original offer. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Alice has indicated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at this point."
