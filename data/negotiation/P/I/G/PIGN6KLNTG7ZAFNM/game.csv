"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is the highest I can go, given my constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make this deal work, I need to stay closer to my initial offer of $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a 5% discount from my original offer. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
