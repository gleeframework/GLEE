Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but above my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I'm keeping John ($100 offer) as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value ($120).  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. I'm still willing to go lower, but not that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims to establish a sense of compromise. It's still a price that earns me a profit but moves closer to Bob's initial offer. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:** I'm not willing to go below $100, so this counteroffer holds firm while signaling some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, how about we meet at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $98 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a profit, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale. Bob is clearly interested but trying to get a good deal. Accepting now ensures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
