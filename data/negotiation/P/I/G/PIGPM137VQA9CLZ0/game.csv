"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my range, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $750,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
