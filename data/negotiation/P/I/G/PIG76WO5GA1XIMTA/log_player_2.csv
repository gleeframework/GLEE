"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to make an offer on this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to acquire this product for a slightly lower price point. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by lowering the price by $100,000. It's a significant enough reduction to signal your serious interest while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a lower price point, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800000 to make it worth my while. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and $850,000 is a good price point for you. While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer again, wasting rounds. Accepting this offer secures a decent deal while leaving some room for your budget."
