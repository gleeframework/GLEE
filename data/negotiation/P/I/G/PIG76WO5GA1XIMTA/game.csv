"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to acquire this product for a slightly lower price point. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a lower price point, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $800000 to make it worth my while. I'm offering the product to you for $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Alice,3,
