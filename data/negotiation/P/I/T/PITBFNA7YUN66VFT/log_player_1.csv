Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value,"" you subtly remind Bob of its worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob could lose the opportunity if he doesn't act, encouraging a decision.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is crucial. You want to be direct about your offer while remaining approachable in case Bob wants to negotiate."
