"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to make a counter offer.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a fairer price would be closer to $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,500? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget constraints.",10000.0,Alice,5,
