"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to make a counter offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Politely Declines:** It acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states it's outside the budget.
* **Anchors Low:** By starting significantly lower ($6,000), it aims to shift the negotiation closer to your desired range.
* **Shows Interest:** It reaffirms your interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Leaves Room:** It doesn't commit to $6,000 as your final offer, allowing for flexibility as the negotiation progresses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a fairer price would be closer to $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down a bit, but $13,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $7,500? I feel like that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Progress:**  It recognizes Alice's movement on price, keeping the tone positive.
* **Moves Up Strategically:** The offer increases from $6,000 to $7,500, showing willingness to compromise but still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Frames as Compromise:** By suggesting $7,500 is ""fair,"" it aims to find a middle ground rather than continuing an extreme back-and-forth.
* **Nears the Walk-Away Point:**  While still below your $8,000 limit, this offer gets closer to your maximum, signaling that you're serious but won't go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now at $10,000, which is still $2,000 more than John's offer.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to bridge the gap. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
