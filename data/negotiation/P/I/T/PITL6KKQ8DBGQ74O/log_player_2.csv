```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000. 

Here's why:

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** The negotiations with Alice have reached a point where neither party seems willing to budge significantly. Alice is not willing to go below $11,500, and Bob is not willing to go above $10,900.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is higher than Alice's final offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, buying from John guarantees him the product without the risk of further negotiation. 

While Bob has been able to reduce the price from $12,000 to $11,500, the potential for further negotiation is limited.  By choosing to buy from John, Bob minimizes the risk of further negotiation breakdown and ensures he gets the product without exceeding his budget."
