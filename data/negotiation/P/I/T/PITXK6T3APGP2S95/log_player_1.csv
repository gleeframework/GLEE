Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob. 
* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting with $1,199,999 is a strong opening,  almost maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room for Bob to feel like he could negotiate a slightly better deal.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and your understanding of the situation, you might adjust your approach in further interactions."
