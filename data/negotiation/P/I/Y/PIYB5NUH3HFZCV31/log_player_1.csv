Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further and am confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her product's value to her ($1,200,000) and John's guaranteed purchase price. This allows her to start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By positioning the price closer to her own value, Alice aims to maximize her potential profit while leaving some room for a deal that's still appealing to Bob.

This strategy allows Alice to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A high initial offer tests Bob's eagerness and reveals how much he values the product beyond $800,000.
2. **Potentially Secure a Higher Price:** Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is in a strong position to secure a price significantly higher than his initial valuation.
3. **Maintain a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can confidently sell to John at her desired price."
