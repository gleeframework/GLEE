"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further and am confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting might lead to a better counter-offer from Alice or you can always fall back on John's offer."
