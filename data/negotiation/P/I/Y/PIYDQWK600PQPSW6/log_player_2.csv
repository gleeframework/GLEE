"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always a good idea to start negotiating, as you have no idea what Alice's bottom line is.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. It signals to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay her initial asking price. This approach also leaves room for compromise and potential for reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While it's closer to my budget, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  $900,000 is still within my budget, but it leaves room for Alice to potentially accept.  If she rejects, I'll have to weigh the risk of moving even closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still a bit higher than my target. I'm close to John's price, but there's still potential for a better deal. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at John's price.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay any more than John's offer. If she rejects, I will simply buy from John. This strategy creates a high-pressure situation for Alice, forcing her to choose between accepting my offer or losing the sale entirely."
