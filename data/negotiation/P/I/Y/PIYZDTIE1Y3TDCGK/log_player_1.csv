"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I don't want to go too low too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,500.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while ensuring I get at least $15,000 (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally come up to my minimum price. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product for $15,000. It's a good outcome as I was able to get my minimum price and avoid selling to John at the same price."
