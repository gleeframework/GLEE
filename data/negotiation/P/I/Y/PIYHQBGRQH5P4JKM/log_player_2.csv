Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be frank, $1,150,000 is too far below the product's true market value.  My final offer is $1,450,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other opportunities.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price well above your budget. While she might come down slightly in another round, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close enough to John's offer of $1,200,000. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and further haggling might not be fruitful.  It's time to secure the product at a price you know works."
