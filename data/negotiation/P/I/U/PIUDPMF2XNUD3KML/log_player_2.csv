"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can potentially get a better deal from Alice, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115? "", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $125 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he's willing to pay from John. It's also a reasonable compromise from Alice's previous offer. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation."
