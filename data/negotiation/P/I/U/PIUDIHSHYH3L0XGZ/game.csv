"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I've assessed its value to be significant, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a fair market value while leaving room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and propose a price of $950,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and propose a price of $920,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
