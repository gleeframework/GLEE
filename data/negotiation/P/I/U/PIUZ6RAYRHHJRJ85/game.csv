"Alice, $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
