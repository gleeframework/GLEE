{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. It also shows good faith by offering a price close to what I know the product is worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is above my minimum and represents a good compromise.  I'm willing to accept this deal and move forward."
