"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by making a counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate down from Alice's price, and a counteroffer will give him a chance to explore a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer to his target price, but he can still aim for something lower.  He should make a counteroffer to see if he can get a price closer to $850,000."
