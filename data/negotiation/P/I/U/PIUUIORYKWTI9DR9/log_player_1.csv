"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay up to that amount, but no more. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $1,300,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I need to see $1,325,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still too low, and I've already made several concessions. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
