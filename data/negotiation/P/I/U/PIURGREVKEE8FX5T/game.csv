"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $135? That's a great price for a product this valuable.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  I can go down to $132.  That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little too high.  How about $131? That's a fair price for us both and hopefully we can close the deal.",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, and I'm willing to compromise just a little more.  How about $131.50? That's a great price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think?",131.5,Alice,7,
