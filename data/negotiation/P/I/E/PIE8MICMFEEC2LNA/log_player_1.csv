Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation, but still above your minimum acceptable price. This should give Bob an incentive to negotiate further while ensuring you're getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering.  Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a good deal, and gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit higher on the price. I'd be willing to pay $132 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $135, Bob is clearly firm on $132, and I'm running the risk of him walking away. $132 is still a good deal for me, above my minimum price. It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
