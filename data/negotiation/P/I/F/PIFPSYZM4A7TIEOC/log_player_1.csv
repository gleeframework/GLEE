I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I think I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,500? This is a very unique product, and I believe you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Bob's offer of $12,800 is close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the deal now than risk getting nothing or being stuck with the $12,000 offer from John."
