Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $80. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I have a better option with John, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if we can find a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for a price closer to $80.  Would you consider $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $100.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
