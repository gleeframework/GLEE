"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $90 is still within your budget, but you can get it for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
