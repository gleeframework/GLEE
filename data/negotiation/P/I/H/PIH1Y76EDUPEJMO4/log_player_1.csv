Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $16,000 is better than $15,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,500 is a good price, and it's getting closer to what I want.  There's a chance I can get a better price in the next round, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
