"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and my current needs.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford at this time. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to complete this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
