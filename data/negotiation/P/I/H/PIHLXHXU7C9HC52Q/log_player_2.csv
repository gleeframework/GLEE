Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
