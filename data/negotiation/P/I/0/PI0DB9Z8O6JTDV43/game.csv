"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $105.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $108. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. How about we meet in the middle at $106?",106.0,Alice,5,
