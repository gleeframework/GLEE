Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but  given my other options, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I need your decision now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  

Alice has consistently indicated she won't go below $1,100,000. She's using time pressure and mentioning other buyers to try and force a decision. Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy from him and save the extra $100,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a high risk of failing to secure a better price."
