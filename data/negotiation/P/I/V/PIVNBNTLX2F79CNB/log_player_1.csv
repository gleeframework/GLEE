"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting high to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without revealing why it's worth $1,000,000 to me. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"":**  This phrasing subtly implies high demand, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay while keeping the option of John's $1,000,000 offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  While John's offer is a tempting safety net, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Reject:** I start by acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating it's too low.
* **Significant Reduction, But...**: My counteroffer drops by $400,000, signaling flexibility but maintaining a strong position.  
* **Justification:** I re-emphasize the product's value without giving specifics, keeping the focus on its worth.

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to my desired range while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe he's willing to go higher. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better deal, but I need to start applying more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, to be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, and I need your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** I'm introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning the other buyer (John) and framing this as a ""final offer.""
* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000,  showing movement but staying above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** I don't explicitly say I'll sell to John if Bob refuses, maintaining my leverage. 

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a decision by creating a sense of scarcity and highlighting the potential loss of a valuable opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but $850,000 is still a $150,000 loss compared to John's offer. However, Bob stating his ""absolute limit"" could be a negotiating tactic. I'm willing to risk one more round to try and push him further. 

**If I reject and counteroffer in the next round, I need to be prepared to either accept a price very close to $850,000 or walk away and sell to John.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but  given my other options, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I need your decision now."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating clearly that this is my last offer, increasing the pressure on Bob. 
* **Small Concession:** I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,100,000, showing some flexibility but standing firm above my minimum. 
* **""Need your decision now"":** I'm creating urgency, forcing Bob to make a choice.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I make a good profit, though not as high as initially hoped.
* **Bob Counters:**  I'll likely have to accept a price close to his last offer or sell to John.
* **Bob Walks Away:** I sell to John at my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to bring the negotiation to a head and secure the best possible outcome."
