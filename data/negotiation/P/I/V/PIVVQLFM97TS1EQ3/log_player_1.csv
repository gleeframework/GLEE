Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's aim for $825,000.  This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
