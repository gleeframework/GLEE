"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a fantastic item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120 and Alice's offer is $120, there's no room for negotiation to save money. You're better off buying from John for the same price, as it avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially losing the product."
