"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me and its worth to you. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,100,000? This would give us both a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
