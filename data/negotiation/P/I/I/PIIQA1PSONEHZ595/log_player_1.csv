I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it allows for some negotiation and leaves room for a profitable sale. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price."
