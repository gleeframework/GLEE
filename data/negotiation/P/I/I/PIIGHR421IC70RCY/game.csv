"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,3,
