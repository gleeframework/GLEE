"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $675000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $675000. Let me know what you think!",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $662500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think?",662500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $662500 is enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $700000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",700000.0,Alice,5,
