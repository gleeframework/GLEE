Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, but I'm also not ready to sell to John yet. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm countering with $13,000.  This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, hopefully making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it would be great to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is the best option right now.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be a better deal, but I'm not guaranteed that John will actually purchase the product.  There's a chance Bob will increase his offer if I reject it, but the risk is too high that he'll walk away completely.  It's better to lock in a sale at a price that's still profitable for me."
