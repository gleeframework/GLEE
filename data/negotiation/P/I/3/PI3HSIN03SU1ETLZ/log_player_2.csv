"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is above his budget, and there's room for negotiation. He can try to get a better price from Alice or switch to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $16500. This is a significant price reduction, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There are still rounds remaining, and he might be able to secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we both see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
