"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd prefer to pay less, $110 is still within your $120 budget and a better deal than buying from John. 
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer.** You risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice if you reject her offer, and you might end up having to pay John's higher price."
