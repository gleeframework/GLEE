"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and gives you a significant profit margin. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good profit margin and is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's try to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
