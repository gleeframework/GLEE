Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to give up on my target profit just yet. I'll offer you a slight adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $112? It's a small step closer to my target, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",112.0,Alice,5,
