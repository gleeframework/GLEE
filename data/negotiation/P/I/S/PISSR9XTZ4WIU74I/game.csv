"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway earlier, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,5,
