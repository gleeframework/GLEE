"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a strong addition to your portfolio. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John is a safe option, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $500,000 is significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation with Bob, as I believe I can still get a higher price.  However, selling to John is now a more attractive option as I'm getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to run out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at your bottom line, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the remaining $10000, so I'll offer $790000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is becoming too high. While $790,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $800,000 from John.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids any further potential negotiation complications."
