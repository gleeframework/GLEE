"Alice, $2000000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 right now. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  If that's not acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1100000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
