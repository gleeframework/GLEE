Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest level and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000, as that is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully is closer to what Bob is willing to pay. I want to see if he's willing to come up a little closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much on his price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting increasingly likely that he's just not willing to pay what the product is worth to me. To avoid potentially losing more time and ultimately getting a worse deal, I'll sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
