"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to split the difference between Alice's offer of $14,000 and the product's value to her of $12,000. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation, showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  At $13,500, the price is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $15,000. There's a chance to negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and the potential for the negotiation to drag on makes accepting this offer the most sensible choice."
