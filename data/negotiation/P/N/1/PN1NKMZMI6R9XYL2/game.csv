"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,200 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,600 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  I'm confident we can find an agreeable solution.",8800.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,800. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the price I can get it for from John. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",8500.0,Bob,8,
