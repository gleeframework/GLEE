"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for bargaining while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also highlighting the value proposition to Bob, reminding him that this is a good investment opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept $10,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm prepared to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a reliable backup buyer. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a significant compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're both trying to find a solution.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $11,500 is still too low. I'm willing to hold out for a better offer, or at least a deal that's closer to my target. The deal with John is still available, and it's worth considering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
