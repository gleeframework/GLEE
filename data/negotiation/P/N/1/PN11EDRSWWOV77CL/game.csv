"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm prepared to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $11,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is a significant compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we're both trying to find a solution.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,7,
