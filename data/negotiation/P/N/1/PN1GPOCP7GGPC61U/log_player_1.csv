Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll propose a new offer of $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob is clearly anchoring hard around $1,200,000. Accepting his offer of $1,220,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
