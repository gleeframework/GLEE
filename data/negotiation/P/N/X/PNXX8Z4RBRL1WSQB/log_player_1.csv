Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your need to sell and my budget. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe with more negotiation, I can get closer to my goal of $1,000,000 or higher.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a win.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  If you're serious about selling, I think this is the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more than $1,000,000, Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
