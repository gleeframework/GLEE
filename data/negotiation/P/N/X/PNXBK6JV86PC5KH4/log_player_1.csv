"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $95. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more than that to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what I want to get from John, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to me, subtly implying that it's worth more than $95. This might make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $87.50? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This gives you a great price and allows me to stay within my own limits.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $89.50? I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and I still have the option to sell to John, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time, and we're getting closer to a deal. I'm going to make one final offer. $91. This is a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for me. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $88? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a final compromise. Please consider this one last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum price. While $88 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to risk missing out on the guaranteed $100 from John. I'll sell to John and secure a better outcome."
