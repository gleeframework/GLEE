{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum value ($12,000) but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy gives me more leverage and allows for potential profit beyond my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

This is just the first step. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. Even if he's unwilling to go up to my initial $15,000, I believe there's room for compromise. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a more favorable outcome through continued negotiation. 

I'll now proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer but also a reduction from my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and the benefit of this price for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to finding a solution that works for both parties.

I believe this counteroffer is fair and balanced, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal while still remaining above my minimum selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting would mean selling at a loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's still room for a deal closer to my minimum value.
* **Risk of losing deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, but there's a chance that Bob might increase his offer in the next round. I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a higher price.

I will proceed to the next round of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $10,750? This is a good compromise that would be fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer represents a further compromise from my previous counteroffer. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still below my ideal price, showing a willingness to find a solution.
* **Middle Ground:**  The price is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's current offer ($9,500), making it seem fair and neutral.
* **Positive and Urgent Tone:**  The message encourages Bob to accept while acknowledging his budget constraints. It also implies a sense of finality, urging him to act quickly before I consider other options. 

This counteroffer aims to secure a deal while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've been clear about my budget, and I'm not willing to pay more than $10000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant financial loss for me.
* **Risk of No Deal:**  Bob's statement about potentially buying from John for $10,000 suggests that he may not be willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting his offer could lead to a stalemate, resulting in no sale.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

While it's disappointing not to reach a higher price, selling to John ensures a secure and profitable outcome."
