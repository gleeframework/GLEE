"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $10750? This is a good compromise that would be fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've been clear about my budget, and I'm not willing to pay more than $10000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
