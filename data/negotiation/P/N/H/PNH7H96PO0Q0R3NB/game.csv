"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the value of this product to the right buyer is undeniably higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  I believe this reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
