"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to pay $115. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105. Would you be open to that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $110?  This would be a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $107.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to what I can afford.",107.0,Bob,4,
