"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential and my own investment. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Consider this a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and she is offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is $400,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a much better deal.
