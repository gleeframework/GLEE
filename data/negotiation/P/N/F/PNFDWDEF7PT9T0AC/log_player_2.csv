"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which still leaves you a decent profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice is offering $13,000.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Potential Counteroffer:**  Bob could counteroffer at $12,500, but there's a risk Alice might reject it.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Accepting $13,000 is a good deal. It's significantly better than John's price and only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and secures a favorable price."
