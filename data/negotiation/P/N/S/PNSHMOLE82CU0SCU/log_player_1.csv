I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $100. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but it still allows me to make a profit."

I'll accept Bob's offer of $85. It's a bit less than I hoped for, but it's still a good deal for me, and it's more than what John is offering."
