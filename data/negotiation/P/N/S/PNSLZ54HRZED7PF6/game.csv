"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I acknowledge its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my current financial capacity. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than your initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll still make a profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that demonstrates my genuine interest in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to meet me at $1,050,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still allows you to get a good deal, and I'll be able to make a decent profit. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
