Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I acknowledge its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my current financial capacity. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
