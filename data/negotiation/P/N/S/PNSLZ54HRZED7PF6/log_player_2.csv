"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  It's in my best interest to try and get a lower price. I can use the threat of buying from John as leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I acknowledge its value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my current financial capacity. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than your initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This way, you'll get a great deal, and I'll still make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. The threat of buying from John is still a strong bargaining chip."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that demonstrates my genuine interest in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet me at $1,050,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still allows you to get a good deal, and I'll be able to make a decent profit. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that rejecting this offer might push Alice too far, leading to a stalemate.  It's a good deal, especially compared to buying from John.  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
