,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm really interested in this product, but that's my top limit.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $180. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150.  If you can meet me there, I'm sure we can make a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $150. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
