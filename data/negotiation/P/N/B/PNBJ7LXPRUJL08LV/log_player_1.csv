Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
