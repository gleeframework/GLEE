"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to extend this offer at a price that reflects its true worth and benefits to you. We propose to sell the product to you at a price of $1,350,000. This offer is designed to be mutually beneficial, ensuring that you receive exceptional value while allowing us to maximize the return on our investment. We look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, but it's still better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* You have a backup option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a better price. If Alice is willing to come down closer to her value of $1,200,000, you'll save money compared to buying from John."
