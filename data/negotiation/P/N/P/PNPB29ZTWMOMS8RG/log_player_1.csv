Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $975,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be open to $800,000? That's the top end of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is a strategic point to stop negotiating with Bob. Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has now stated $800,000 is the top of his budget.  This aligns with your knowledge that the product's value to him is $800,000. It's unlikely you can push him much higher.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. There's no risk of further negotiation or Bob ultimately backing out.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations with Bob has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting John's offer provides immediate closure."
