Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  By starting at $11,000, I give Bob some room to make a counteroffer. This makes him feel more in control of the negotiation.
* **John as a backup:** I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, which provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000 and  even below my initial offer of $11,000. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** I'm confident I can get a better price.  I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer or even slightly lower, but still above Bob's offer, and see if he's willing to negotiate further.
* **John is a backup:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I make at least my minimum desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $11,000.  
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer still keeps me above my minimum price of $12,000, ensuring I'm not losing money.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By offering a compromise, I show flexibility but don't give away too much. I still have room to negotiate if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **No more room for negotiation:**  I've already made a concession, and Bob's offer is at the limit of what I'm willing to accept.  There's no guarantee he'll come up any further, and I don't want to risk another round and end up getting a lower price.
* **John is a sure thing:** John is willing to pay my minimum, guaranteeing that I get my desired profit.  

Since I have a reliable buyer in John, it's more logical to accept his offer and sell the product to him for $12,000.  I can avoid further negotiation and ensure I meet my financial goals."
