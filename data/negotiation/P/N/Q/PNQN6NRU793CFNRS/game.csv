"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is far below the value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000.  This price is still below my minimum, but it reflects a genuine attempt to find a solution we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
