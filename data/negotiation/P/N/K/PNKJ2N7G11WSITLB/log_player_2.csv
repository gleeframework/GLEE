"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still a bit higher than your ideal price point. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's being taken advantage of.  By starting with a lower price, it also sets the stage for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but she's also showing a willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too high for you. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise. $95 is closer, but still a bit more than I want to spend.  How about $90? This is a fair price that works for both of us,  and allows us to come to a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to move a little bit. This suggests you're ready to make a deal but are still trying to save some money.  It also highlights your willingness to compromise and potentially close the deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, so I'm offering it to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a genuine willingness to compromise, and $92 is now closer to your desired price point.  It's still a bit higher than your ideal price, but it's getting into a range where it's worth accepting the deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's also likely to take more time and there's a risk that the negotiations could break down. 

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product, especially considering you have the option to buy from John for $120 if you're unhappy with the outcome."
