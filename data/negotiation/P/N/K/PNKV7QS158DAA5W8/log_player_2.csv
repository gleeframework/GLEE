"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we stay well below our $100 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $95 is my initial asking price, I could meet you halfway at $85. This offer reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still a bit high. We'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle on $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're holding firm at $75. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of both our initial offer and Alice's cost."
