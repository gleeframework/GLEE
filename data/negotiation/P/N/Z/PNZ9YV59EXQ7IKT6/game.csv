"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still trying to get the best deal I can, and I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
