"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you have room to negotiate. Aiming for a lower price will save you money. You'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  You've shown willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. The offer of $9,000 is below Alice's ideal price but above her minimum (as the product is worth $8,000 to her)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and potentially saves you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still trying to get the best deal I can, and I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to split the difference between your last offer ($9,000) and Alice's latest offer ($9,500). This shows continued willingness to compromise while keeping the pressure on Alice to come down a bit further."
