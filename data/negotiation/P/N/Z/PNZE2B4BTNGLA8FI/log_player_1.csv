Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant amount above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation but still reflecting the product's worth. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk going lower.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me my minimum, and I don't have to worry about further negotiation with Bob."
