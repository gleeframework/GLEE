"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a significant value for your investment, and I'll be earning a good return on my asset.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the market price I could get it for from John.",920000.0,Bob,4,
