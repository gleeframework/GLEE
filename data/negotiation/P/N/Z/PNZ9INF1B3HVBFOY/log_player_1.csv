Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's a $3,000 gap where you can negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **It demonstrates you're serious about selling:** By offering a price that's not your absolute minimum, you show Bob you're willing to compromise but also that you value the product.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
