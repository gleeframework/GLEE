"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know you'll find immense value in it.  To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This first offer is designed to assess Bob's eagerness and flexibility. His response will inform my subsequent strategies. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John ($1,000,000).  I won't let the negotiations with Bob drag on if they aren't proving fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a fairer agreement. I am willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value and my initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective, however, my valuation of the product is significantly higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not conceding too much. This counter-offer splits the difference between his last offer and mine, encouraging him to move towards a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Maintaining Strength:**  I'm not rushing to accept his offer, demonstrating that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a strong deal. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is well above my minimum ($1,000,000) and provides a healthy profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating his seriousness about the purchase. 
* **Time Value:** We've already completed four rounds. While I have more rounds,  securing a good deal now outweighs the potential for slightly more profit with diminishing returns and the risk of Bob walking away."
