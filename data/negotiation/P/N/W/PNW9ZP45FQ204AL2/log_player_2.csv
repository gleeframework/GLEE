"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a bit less than that. How about $100? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is higher than your maximum budget of $80.
* You know you can get the product for $80 from John. 

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to get the best price."
