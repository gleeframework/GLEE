"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle between $9500 and $8500? I'm thinking of a price of $9000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $8700. How about we meet in the middle between $9000 and $8700? I'm thinking of a price of $8850. It's a small step up from your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8850.0,Alice,5,
