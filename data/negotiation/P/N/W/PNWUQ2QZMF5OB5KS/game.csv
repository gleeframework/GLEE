"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. I'm ready to be flexible, but I need to ensure a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
