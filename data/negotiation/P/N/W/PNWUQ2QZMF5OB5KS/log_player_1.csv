"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price, indicating there's room for negotiation. Accepting $950,000 is a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'll counter to keep him engaged while aiming higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,010,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your perspective."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $980,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer, but the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed price is still significant. I'll express some flexibility to keep him engaged but aim for a price closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. I'm ready to be flexible, but I need to ensure a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your position."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $990,000 is the maximum I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my desired price point. While he's getting closer, the remaining difference is substantial enough to warrant accepting John's offer. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,200,000 value and avoids further negotiation risk."
