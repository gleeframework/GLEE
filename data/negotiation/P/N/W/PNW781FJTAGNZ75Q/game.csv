"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to my budget. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is the best price for this product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
