You can definitely do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $10,500. This is still above Alice's value for the product, but leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than her initial offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm raising my offer one last time to $12,000.  This is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but I'm hoping to meet in the middle this round. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to consider buying from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm running out of time, and with only one round left, it's not likely I can get a better price from Alice. I'll buy from John to ensure I get the product."
