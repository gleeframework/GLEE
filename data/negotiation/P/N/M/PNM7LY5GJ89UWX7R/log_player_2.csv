You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's always worth exploring if you can get it lower.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to see Alice's reaction. This is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to push for a good price.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, giving Bob the opportunity to refine his strategy in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but Bob is still determined to get a better price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and provides an opportunity to potentially secure a price closer to his ideal range.  He can also use this round to further gauge Alice's bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise while still pushing for a price that is beneficial for him. This move allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway and potentially close the deal sooner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and Bob is now within his target price range.  Accepting this offer will allow him to acquire the product at a significant discount compared to John's offer.  While there's always the potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John or the negotiation dragging on for longer outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
