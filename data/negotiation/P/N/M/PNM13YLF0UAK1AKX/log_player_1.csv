{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm willing to let it go for $110. It's a steal, you won't find a better deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering I've already made a few offers and we're getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

This negotiation has gone on for a while, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum price, it's still not high enough.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm not going to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
