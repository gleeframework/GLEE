"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **You can save money:** While $100 is less than your $120 maximum, you know John will sell it for $120. There's a chance Alice might go lower. 
* **Negotiation power:** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to come down in price to make the sale."
