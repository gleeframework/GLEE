"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

This is a starting point, slightly above Bob's value but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my $15,000 value as possible within the 10 rounds, but also want to avoid losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still aiming to stay above Bob's value. This should show that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't sell for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is still too low, but Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer. I'm confident we can get closer to my target value with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, aiming for a compromise that is closer to my value while still being within Bob's possible range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is an increase, it's still significantly below my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price point.  The time is running out and I need to maximize my profit."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is tempting, with only two rounds left, I still believe I can secure a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

With only one round remaining, I'm lowering my offer slightly to show flexibility. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than previous offers, it's still not enough. I've exhausted all my negotiation options and need to secure the deal. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best course of action at this point."
