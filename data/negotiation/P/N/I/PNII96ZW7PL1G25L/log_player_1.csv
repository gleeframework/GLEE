Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer of $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's higher than John's offer, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, I can get Bob to accept a price that is closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's counteroffer is still too low. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely to yield a significantly better price. Accepting John's offer guarantees me a solid profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation failures."
