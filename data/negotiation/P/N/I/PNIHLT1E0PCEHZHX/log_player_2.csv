"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, I'll choose to buy from him to save money and avoid further negotiations."
