"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
