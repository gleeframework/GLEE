``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice's price of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Bob saves money:** Accepting Alice's offer means Bob saves $300,000. 
* **Bob still gets a good deal:**  Even though Bob pays $1,200,000, he still gets the product for a price lower than his maximum budget of $1,500,000."
