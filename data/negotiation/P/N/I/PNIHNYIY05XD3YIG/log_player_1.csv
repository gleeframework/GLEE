"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous as to offend Bob. It leaves ample room for him to counteroffer and for a mutually beneficial deal to be reached. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping in mind that you have the John offer ($800,000) as a fallback ensures you don't settle for anything drastically lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly less than your target price and what Bob is willing to pay. You have room to negotiate, and with 8 rounds remaining, there's a good chance you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By saying you're willing to come down, you show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic often feels fair to both parties, even though it doesn't necessarily reflect a true midpoint in value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above your minimum ($800,000) while still offering Bob a substantial discount from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to settle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his counteroffers are getting closer to your desired range. While $1,075,000 is a tempting offer, you're still early in the negotiation (6 rounds left). It's worth pushing a little further to see if you can bridge the gap and secure a price closer to $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but that's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Strategic Compromise:** You're accepting a price slightly below your previous offer but above the midpoint between your initial ask and Bob's first offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep dragging out the negotiation. This offer maintains some of your potential profit while increasing the likelihood of closing the deal."
