""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $930,000 is below my initial target, it's crucial to consider the following:

* **Time:** I only have two rounds left, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer significantly. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of getting a lower offer or no deal at all.
* **Certainty:** Accepting Bob's offer provides a guaranteed $930,000. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but there's always a slight risk that something could go wrong. 
* **Profit Margin:** $930,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

Taking these factors into account, accepting Bob's offer at this stage presents the best balance of profit and minimal risk."
