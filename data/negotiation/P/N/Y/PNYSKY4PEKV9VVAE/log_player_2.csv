"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($10,000).  You have a chance to get it for even less by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is halfway between Alice's desired price of $8,000 and my maximum price of $10,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I want to pay. I'm willing to take another round of negotiation and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved slightly closer to my initial counteroffer, so I'm also moving slightly closer to hers, offering $8,750. This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,400 is getting closer to my maximum price of $10,000. However, I'm not seeing a significant change in her willingness to negotiate. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further rounds of negotiation. This will guarantee I get the product within my budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
