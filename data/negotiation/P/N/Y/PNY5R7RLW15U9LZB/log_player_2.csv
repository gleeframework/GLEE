"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what you can get from John.  Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, buying from John is the best choice."
