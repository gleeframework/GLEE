"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me, but not too far off from what John is willing to pay. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and encourages him to make a counteroffer, which is what I want to happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, I can potentially do better. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?"", ""product_price"": 97.50} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to my initial asking price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  If that works for you, let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 just doesn't quite work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm  making another counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my initial asking price but still reasonable for Bob.  My goal is to get as close to my desired price as possible without risking losing Bob as a buyer."
