"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's truly a game-changer in its field and offers unparalleled value. Given its significance to you, I believe it's worth every penny of its $12,000 value. However, to make this opportunity more accessible, I am offering it to you for $11,000. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to fairly compensate for the product's worth. I trust this pricing will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further."
