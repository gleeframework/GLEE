"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to counteroffer and attempt to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer starts at $1,050,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's important to note that Bob wants to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to avoid delaying the purchase too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He is aiming to save as much money as possible and feels there is still room for negotiation to get closer to his desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to meet Alice halfway while still aiming for a price closer to his target. This move shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer, and is now very close to Bob's target price.  While he could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will become unwilling to continue and he may end up having to pay $1,000,000 to John.  It's also possible that Alice will counteroffer again and drive the price even higher.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
