"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell to John for $800,000, which is less than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). This makes her claim unlikely.
* You have a backup option with John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her hand. She's motivated to sell and might offer a lower price. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you're not worse off as you can still buy from John."
