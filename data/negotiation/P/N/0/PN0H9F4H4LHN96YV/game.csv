"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $9,000 is significantly below the value the product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500?  It's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you. I'm willing to go down to $10,200 as a final offer. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get what we want out of this deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,100. If we can agree on this price, I'll commit to purchasing the product immediately.",10100.0,Bob,6,
