Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but  $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $930,000? I think that's a fair offer.
