"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, but  $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $930,000? I think that's a fair offer.",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I can't go lower than $970,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal and both be happy.",970000.0,Alice,5,
