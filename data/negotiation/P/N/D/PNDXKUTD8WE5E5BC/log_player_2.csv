"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, we believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its true worth, I am offering it to you for $110. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a product valued at $120 by you, at a slightly higher but reasonable price. Don't miss out on this chance to get a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overvaluing the product:**  She's trying to convince you it's worth $120 when you've already established your maximum price is $120. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $120. While it's not ideal, it's better than paying $110.
* **Potential for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be willing to lower it to make the sale, especially since she values the product less than you do."
