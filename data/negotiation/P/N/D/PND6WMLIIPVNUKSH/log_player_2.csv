"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $10,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

You are starting the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows that you are serious about getting a good deal and are willing to negotiate. $9,000 is still a significant amount of money, but it leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that is still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your maximum budget. It's better to buy from John for $10,000 to ensure you stay within your budget."
