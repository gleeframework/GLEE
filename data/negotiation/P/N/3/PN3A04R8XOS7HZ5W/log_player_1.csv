Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get from the product. This encourages him to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting at $1,000,000, I leave room for negotiation and can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasizing value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob makes him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Plan B:**  The option to sell to John provides a safety net and allows me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  Although John offers a higher price, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to increase the price while still staying within the range of what he might be willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've countered with $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Compromise:** I've framed it as a compromise, showing willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I've added ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground,"" to signal I'm open to further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This shows good faith and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Remaining firm:** I'm still significantly above Bob's offer, leaving room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm open to finding a middle ground, which makes me appear reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $925,000 is only $75,000 away from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will either reject further offers or that I might not be able to reach a price I'm satisfied with.
* **Value of the deal:** $925,000 is still a significant amount of money, and it's a good deal considering the potential risk of further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Accepting the offer:** This minimizes the risk of losing the deal and allows me to secure a decent price.
* **Taking advantage of the compromise:** Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, and it's a good indication that we've reached a mutually acceptable point. 
* **Moving forward:** By accepting the offer, I can move forward and finalize the sale, minimizing any potential delays or setbacks."
