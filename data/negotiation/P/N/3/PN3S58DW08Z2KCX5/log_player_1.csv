Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, but leaves room for potential compromise. I'm aiming for a good deal, but also acknowledging the possibility that Bob might have a higher value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is a decent offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my original asking price.  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would like to push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good deal. It's significantly more than what John is offering and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  It's time to close the deal and secure the profit."
