Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value and doesn't reflect the potential benefits you'll realize. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth, and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product.  While I agree it's unique, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price acknowledges the product's worth while allowing me to make a reasonable investment. I hope we can find a compromise at this point.
