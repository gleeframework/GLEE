"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $1300000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. This offer reflects a significant commitment on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and the commitment you're showing. However, $900000 is significantly lower than the product's true value, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.  To meet halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. This is still a substantial discount for you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence. However,  $1000000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  To reach a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
