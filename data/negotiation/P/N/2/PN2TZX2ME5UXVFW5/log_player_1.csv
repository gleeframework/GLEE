{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still gives me some room to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer altogether. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take that option."
