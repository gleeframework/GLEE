"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $14,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on it.",14500.0,Alice,5,
