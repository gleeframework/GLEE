"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer reflects the value to me while ensuring we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product at $1,100,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident you'll find this price to be a great value for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
