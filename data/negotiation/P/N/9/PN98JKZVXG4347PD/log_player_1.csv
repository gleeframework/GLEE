Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to start the negotiation.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by inviting Bob to share his thoughts. 
* **Plan B:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. While he's still below my desired price, he's shown willingness to negotiate and recognizes the product's value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can counter with a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I've dropped my price significantly from $1,400,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a compromise.
* **Reiterate the value:** I've restated the value of the product, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Positive tone:** I've maintained a positive and open tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I've emphasized the importance of finding a deal that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer reflects the value to me while ensuring we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is stalled:** While Bob has increased his offer, it seems we're stuck at a point where we can't reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Opportunity cost:** The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more time I'm losing that I could be spending securing John's offer.  John's offer provides me with the best possible outcome.

**Next step:**  I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if I can get Bob to budge. If he rejects again, I'll move on to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.

**Reasoning:**

* **One last attempt:** I'm offering one final counteroffer, recognizing that further negotiations could be unproductive.
* **Slight compromise:** I've reduced my price to $1,100,000, demonstrating flexibility without going below my desired minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob, suggesting it's still a good deal at this price. 
* **Setting a clear deadline:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
