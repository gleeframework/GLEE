"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay $950,000 for the product at this time. I hope this proposal works for you.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm open to a final compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  This would allow for a fair deal for both of us, and I think it's a price that reflects the value of the product to you.  What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I understand your position and am willing to consider your latest offer. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000. This is a significant step towards meeting you halfway, while also ensuring I can manage the cost within my budget.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
