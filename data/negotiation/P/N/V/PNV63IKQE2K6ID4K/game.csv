"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking that $750000 is a bit below my target.

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $780000 is a bit higher than your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $820000. This price is closer to my target, but I'm still open to negotiations. Let me know if this is something you'd be comfortable with.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $810000.
