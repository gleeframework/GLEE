Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I believe this offer is appealing enough to entice Bob while leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount of money.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to sell it for more, it's a fair deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
