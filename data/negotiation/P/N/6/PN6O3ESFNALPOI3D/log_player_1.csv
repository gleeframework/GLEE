{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is high for you, but leaves room for potential compromise. It also acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product, making it more likely he will engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'll counter his offer and aim for a price closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is only $200 away from my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting close to my floor and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
