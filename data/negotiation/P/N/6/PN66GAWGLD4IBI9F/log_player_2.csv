"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, as I believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1000000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price as buying from John. Since you want to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this round.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will yield a better price."
