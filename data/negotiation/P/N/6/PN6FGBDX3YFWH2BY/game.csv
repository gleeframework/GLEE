"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. Let me know if this works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get it for a lower price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1,050,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
