"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is below the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,850,000? This acknowledges the value while making it a worthwhile investment for you.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go to $1,700,000.  It's a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also aligning with my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,700,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $1,775,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1775000.0,Alice,5,
