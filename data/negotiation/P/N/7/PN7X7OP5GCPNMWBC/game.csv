"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $7,000. What do you say?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is still quite low, and I need to get closer to the actual value. Would you be willing to do $9,500? ",9500.0,Alice,5,
