"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's still a fair price, considering the value of the item.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's a one-time offer, so think carefully before making your next move!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like the way you think! Meeting in the middle is a great approach. However, I'm still a bit short on the profit side. I can do $10,800, which is my absolute lowest price. It's a one-time offer, so make it count!",10800.0,Alice,5,
