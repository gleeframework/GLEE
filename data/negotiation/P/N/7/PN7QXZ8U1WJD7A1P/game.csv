"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16,000. What do you think?"
