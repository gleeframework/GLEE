"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's beneficial for both of us.  I'm also aware that John is a backup option, so I don't have to be afraid of losing the deal completely."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a bit higher.  I'm running out of rounds, but I'm not ready to give up on a better deal yet."

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. It's a small decrease from my last offer but still a decent amount. I'm hoping this is enough to close the deal. We're running out of rounds, and John is always a viable option, but I think there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
