Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that I know you'll find incredibly beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible without losing the guaranteed sale to John.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle above our guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential to benefit from it, making the offer more enticing. 
 
**Important Note:** While John guarantees $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above that price means a quicker sale and potentially less hassle."
