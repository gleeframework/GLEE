"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a good balance between what you're willing to sell it for and what I'm willing to pay.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we settle on $8,900?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal without further delay.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $8,700? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair compromise.",8700.0,Bob,6,
