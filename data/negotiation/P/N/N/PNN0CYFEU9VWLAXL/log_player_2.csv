"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a chance for a significant return while acknowledging the value I place on it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. 
* You have a backup option with John, ensuring you can still get the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
