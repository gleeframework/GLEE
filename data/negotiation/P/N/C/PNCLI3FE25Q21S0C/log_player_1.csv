**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and inching closer to my minimum price. I'm not willing to go below $800,000, but there's still room to negotiate upwards from his offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my absolute minimum price.  While there might be a slim chance of squeezing a bit more out of the deal, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer guarantees I make my minimum and avoids potentially losing him as a buyer."
