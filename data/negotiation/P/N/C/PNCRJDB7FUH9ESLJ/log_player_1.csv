Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a decent price for Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation for me. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price a bit, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if the price drops too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold of $8,000, and it's likely that he won't go lower. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
