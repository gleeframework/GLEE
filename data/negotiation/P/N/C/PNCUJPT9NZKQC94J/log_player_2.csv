"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is still above the product's value to you ($1,000,000).  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's too early to buy from John at $1,500,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is higher than your offer. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still lower than the price from John ($1,500,000) and higher than the value of the product to you ($1,000,000).  This is a good deal for you, so it's best to accept it."
