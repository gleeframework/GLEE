Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (as stated in the prompt)
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $12,000
* **John's willingness to pay:** $15,000

Therefore, offering $14,000 to Bob:

* Gives me a higher profit than selling to John ($14,000 > $15,000).
* Still gives Bob a better deal than paying $15,000 to John.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still giving Bob an incentive to accept the offer."
