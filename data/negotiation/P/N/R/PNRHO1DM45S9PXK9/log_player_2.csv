"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's closer to his desired price. However, Bob can likely still negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit over budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. This is the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,125,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks pushing the price even higher or delaying the purchase.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at his guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
