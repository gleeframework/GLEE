"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1100000 to see if we can find common ground. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is just too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $975000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1012500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $980000?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're close, but $980000 is still just a little too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us and it's the closest I can go without losing too much. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
