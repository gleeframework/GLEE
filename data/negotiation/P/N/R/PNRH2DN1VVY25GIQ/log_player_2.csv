"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but he's also making it clear that he's serious about buying the product.  Offering $10,000 shows he's willing to negotiate and potentially reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position.  He can likely get the price down further.  $11,000 is still a good deal for him, but it's worth trying to see if he can get it even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing that he is willing to negotiate further by offering a price slightly higher than his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This demonstrates good faith while keeping the pressure on Alice to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $11,250.  That's only $250 more than your last offer, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, Bob can still potentially get a better price. He has more rounds to negotiate and still has John as a backup option. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and explore if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,875.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating his willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway once again. He's showing that he's serious about making a deal, but he's also not willing to overpay. By offering $10,875, he's putting the pressure back on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,875 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $11,062.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,062.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,062.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,062.50, which is a good deal for Bob. He's saved a significant amount compared to John's price and has only three rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Alice seems to be approaching her bottom line. Accepting the offer is a safe and beneficial decision at this point."
