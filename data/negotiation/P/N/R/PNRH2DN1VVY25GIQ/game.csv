"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000?  That way we both get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $11,250.  That's only $250 more than your last offer, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,875.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,875 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $11,062.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal.",11062.5,Alice,7,
