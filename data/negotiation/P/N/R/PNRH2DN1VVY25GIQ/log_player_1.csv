Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $10,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $11,250.  That's only $250 more than your last offer, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
