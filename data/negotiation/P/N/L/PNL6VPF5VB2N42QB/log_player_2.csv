# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to let you have this incredible product for $13,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You're getting the product for $1,500 less than John's price.
* **While you'd like to pay less, this is the best deal you're likely to get.** Alice is already offering a price below her own valuation.

**Remember, you're trying to save money, but you also want to secure the product. Accepting Alice's offer achieves both goals.**"
