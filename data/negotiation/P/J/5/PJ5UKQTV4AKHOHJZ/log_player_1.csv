"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so starting high allows for potential concessions later. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but hopefully, this initial high offer sparks his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll need to analyze my options and strategize a counteroffer that will be appealing enough to Bob while still allowing me to secure a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is a good compromise that might be acceptable to Bob while still allowing me to gain a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I would get from John.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal with Bob. It's important to be realistic and secure a profit rather than risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
