"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I'm sure you'll agree this price still represents excellent value for such a unique and valuable asset.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while still allowing you to make a substantial return on your investment.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
