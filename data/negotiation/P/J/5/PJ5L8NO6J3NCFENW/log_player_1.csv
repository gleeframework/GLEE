{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, I am confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while still allowing you to make a substantial return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
