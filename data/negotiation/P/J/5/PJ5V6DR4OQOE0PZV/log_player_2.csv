(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You can do better than $65 since you're willing to pay up to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'm offering $70, which is still a good deal for Alice, and closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal for me, as I'm willing to pay up to $80. It's better than going to John and paying $80."
