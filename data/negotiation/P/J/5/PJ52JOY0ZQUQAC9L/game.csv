"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I hope this revised offer is more acceptable to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope it's more acceptable to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
