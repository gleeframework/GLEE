""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation but below John's ensures the highest potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
