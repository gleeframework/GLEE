"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to you is $15,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $13,000 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum requirements. Let's meet at $13,500, and we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
