"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my financial limits. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price allows me to make a profit while still offering you a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It would be a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
