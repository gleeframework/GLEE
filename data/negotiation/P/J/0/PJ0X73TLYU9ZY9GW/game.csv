"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still give you a substantial profit, and I'd be able to get a better price than selling to John. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That's closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $900,000 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. How about we compromise at $950,000?  This is a solid deal for both of us, and it's much more than I'd get from selling to John. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
