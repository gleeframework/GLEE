Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would still give you a substantial profit, and I'd be able to get a better price than selling to John. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That's closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again.  $900,000 is getting closer to my goal, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $900,000 is a fair price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. How about we compromise at $950,000?  This is a solid deal for both of us, and it's much more than I'd get from selling to John. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
