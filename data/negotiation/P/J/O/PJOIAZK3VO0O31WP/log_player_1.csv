I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a good starting point.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider lowering the price a bit, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000 as that's my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $11,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my desired amount."
