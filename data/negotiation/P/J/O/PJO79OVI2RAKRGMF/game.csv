"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
