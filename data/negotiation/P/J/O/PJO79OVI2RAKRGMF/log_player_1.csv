Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. We're early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to hold out a little longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,275,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller concession this round to signal that I'm nearing my limit. By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a decision and avoid further back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at $1,225,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Profitable:** It's still a profit of $25,000 over selling to John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his last offer, and I risk him walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
