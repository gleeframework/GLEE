"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $250 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $220, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $220 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to consider $180?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to save as much as possible, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $180. I can do $200, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $200 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $190?",190.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $195 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to go up to $185, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",185.0,Bob,8,
