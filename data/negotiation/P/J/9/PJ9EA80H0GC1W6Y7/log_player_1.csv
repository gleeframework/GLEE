"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential to get closer to my initial offer. Bob's low counteroffer suggests he might be willing to negotiate further.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and would still allow us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product, and his willingness to meet me in the middle indicates he's open to further compromise. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,400,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1400000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's potential for a higher price. It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $1,200,000. This gives me a safety net, and I'm not under pressure to settle for a lower price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,350,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us to move forward with the transaction.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firm on his price of $1,200,000, and I've already rejected his offer once at this price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price.  At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
