"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $110, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him feel valued.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to increase his interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which is important for keeping the conversation going. 

**Note:** I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more aggressive with my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price.
* **My Value:** I have a minimum value of $120 for this product, and selling to John for that price is always an option.
* **Negotiation:**  I want to continue the negotiation process to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. There's a possibility that I can get a higher price than $95 if I'm patient.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $95 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a compromise by offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer of $95 and my previous offer of $110.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again reiterating the value of the product to Bob and making it clear that this price still represents a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While I'm being flexible, I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive relationship with Bob.

I'm confident this counteroffer is reasonable and will hopefully lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Close Enough:** While Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum value of $120, it's still not high enough. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at a lower price.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation with Bob, and I'm confident I can push for a better price in the next round.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. While $100 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product for me. How about $107? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Focus on Fair Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that my offer is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not dropping the price too much below my minimum value, demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair deal.

**Goal:** I aim to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price in the next few rounds. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, and I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $105 is essentially meeting me in the middle of our last two offers ($100 and $107).
* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $105 is still below my minimum value of $120, it's close enough to consider.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already on round 6, and I want to close the deal before I'm forced to sell to John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in communication, so accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy at this point. 

**Conclusion:**  I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105, as it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to close the deal without risking further negotiation or selling at a lower price."
