"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is offering the maximum he values the product for, and we know we have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John. It makes the most sense to take the sure thing with John."
