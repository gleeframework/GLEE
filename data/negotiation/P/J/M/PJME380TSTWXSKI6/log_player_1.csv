Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, but it's still a decent amount. Since I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum value. Here's my counteroffer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. Since I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send another counteroffer to try to get closer to my minimum value."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum value, and I'm starting to think that selling to John for $1,200,000 might not be the best option anymore. Since Bob's offer is only $10,000 less than my minimum value, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $990,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good compromise."
