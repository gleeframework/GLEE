"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but considering its importance to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am offering the product to you for $9,500. This price reflects the product's worth and also allows me to make a fair profit. I understand it might be a bit above your initial expectations, but given its high value to you, I believe this is a reasonable offer. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further or if there's anything else I can assist you with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is too high. While it's below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave the door open for a counter-offer or can proceed with John if necessary."
