Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is $400,000 above your minimum acceptable price, but still significantly below the value Bob places on the product. This strategy is designed to maximize your profit while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob. If he rejects, you still have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing you a profit of $800,000."
