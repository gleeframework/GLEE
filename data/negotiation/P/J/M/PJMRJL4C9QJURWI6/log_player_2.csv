"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John.
* **You value the product lower than John:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her, it's still significantly lower than what you'd pay John.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice for you."
