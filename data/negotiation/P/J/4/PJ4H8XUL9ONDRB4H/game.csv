"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite low for the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
