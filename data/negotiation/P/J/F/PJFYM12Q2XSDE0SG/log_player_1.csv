Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,150,000:
    * Leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
    * Provides a potential $150,000 profit above John's offer.
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob's perspective, fostering potential negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  A more complex approach might involve multiple offers and counter-offers."
