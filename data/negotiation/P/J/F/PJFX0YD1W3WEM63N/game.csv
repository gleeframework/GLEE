"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product sits higher. Would you be open to considering $1,120,000? This price better reflects the unique benefits and potential the product offers.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your “final offer” doesn’t fully reflect the value this product will bring.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that makes sense for me. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm proposing $1,080,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still not convinced that $1,080,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,015,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1015000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been flexible and made significant moves to reach a deal, but I'm not seeing that same flexibility from your side. I need you to be realistic about the value this product offers.  I'm willing to consider $1,050,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. Let me know if you're ready to make a serious commitment.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you feel I haven't been flexible enough, but I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'd like to propose $1,025,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
