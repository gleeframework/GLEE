Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product is worth more than $180 by stating ""I think it's worth a lot.""
* **Limited Time Offer:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob first, you create a sense of scarcity and encourage a quicker decision. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a backup to buy the product at your minimum price."
