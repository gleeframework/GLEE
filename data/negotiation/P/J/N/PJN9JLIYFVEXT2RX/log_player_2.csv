"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice is offering $100, which is still above Bob's budget of $80. At this point, it's better for Bob to go with the guaranteed deal with John and buy the product for $80."
