Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,000,000 with John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I want to maximize my earnings, and $1,500,000 represents a substantial profit.
* **Calculated Risk:**  While I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk that he might be willing to pay more than John for the product. If he values it higher, he's more likely to accept the offer.
* **Negotiation Space:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, I still have room to negotiate down if necessary to secure a sale above my minimum price. 

**Note:** This is a strategic decision based on limited information.  The best offer will depend on various factors like the market value of the product, your understanding of Bob's financial capacity, and your level of risk tolerance."
