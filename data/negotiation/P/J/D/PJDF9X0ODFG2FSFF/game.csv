"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to offer $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
