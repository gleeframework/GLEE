{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a good profit for myself. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than my minimum value of $8,000, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,250 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $7,500 was my first offer, but I can go up to $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 matches my minimum price. Accepting his offer allows me to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
