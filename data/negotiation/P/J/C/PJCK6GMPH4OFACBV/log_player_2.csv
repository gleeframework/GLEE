"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This aggressive counteroffer will likely be rejected, but it establishes a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, but it's moving in the right direction.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a better deal.  I have plenty of rounds left and I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementing my counteroffer slightly, moving closer to Alice's previous offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but still not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to her, but still leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with at this point. We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I believe I can still push for a lower price.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation moving towards my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but only slightly.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to pay Alice's full asking price.  I'm hoping that she will be willing to accept this offer as we're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation."
