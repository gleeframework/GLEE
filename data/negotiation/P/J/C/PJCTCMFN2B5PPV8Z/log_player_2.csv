This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is nearing her limit:**  Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Savings are significant:** You're still getting a $2,200 discount from your maximum budget.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Further haggling could push Alice away, and John's offer is significantly worse."
