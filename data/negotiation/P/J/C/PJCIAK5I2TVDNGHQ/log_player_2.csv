"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to his maximum value of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and still gives me a good profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should continue to negotiate. Alice has lowered her offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, Bob can still try to get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price of $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and still gives you a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and Bob is already getting a good deal at this price. While he can try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob will have to buy from John for $1,000,000. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice as it saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John."
