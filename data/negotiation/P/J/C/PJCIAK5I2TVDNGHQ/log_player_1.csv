# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.
