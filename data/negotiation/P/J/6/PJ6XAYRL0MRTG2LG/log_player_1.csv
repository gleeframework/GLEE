Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a fallback option if Bob rejects the offer and I can't find a better price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm hoping to get closer to that figure through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price and may be more appealing than his initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** With each round, Bob's offer is increasing.  I believe I can push him closer to $10,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm only increasing the price by $200 from Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also maintain some leverage.
* **Close to Bob's Offer:**  $9,400 is very close to Bob's last offer, potentially making it more appealing than his previous counteroffer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offer:** Bob has now matched my last offer, indicating he's willing to meet me halfway. 
* **Close to Minimum:** $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a better outcome than selling to John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a better outcome, but it also risks Bob walking away.  Accepting the offer secures a good price."
