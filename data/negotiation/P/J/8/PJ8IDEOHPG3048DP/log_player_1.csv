Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
