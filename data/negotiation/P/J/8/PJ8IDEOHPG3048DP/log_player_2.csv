Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what John is offering. It's better to buy from John and save $50,000."
