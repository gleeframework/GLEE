Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $12,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make more than your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be higher elsewhere, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
