"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand $12,000 is a significant investment, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $6,000 is considerably lower than my minimum. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is still pushing it. How about we settle on $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250? It's a strong offer, and it saves you time and effort finding another buyer.",8250.0,Bob,6,
