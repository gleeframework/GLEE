"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's important to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below our actual budget of $8,000 to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to move on her price. If she completely rejects this, we know we might have to go up significantly or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand $12,000 is a significant investment, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $6,000 is considerably lower than my minimum. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $9,000 is still above your budget. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $8,000. You can afford to reject this offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm willing to increase my offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're serious, but staying well below her current price and below our max budget.
* **Compromise Language:** Framing this as a ""fair compromise"" can make it more appealing to Alice while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves some room for another counteroffer from Alice if she's not quite ready to accept $7,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $7,000 is still pushing it. How about we settle on $8,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting close to your budget, but her ""final offer"" is still above what John is offering. There's no harm in seeing if she'll budge a little more, especially since she's declared it her final offer.  You can try one more counteroffer before resorting to John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,250? It's a strong offer, and it saves you time and effort finding another buyer."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're meeting Alice directly in the middle of her last offer ($8,500) and our previous offer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Benefits for Alice:** By mentioning the time and effort saved, we're subtly reminding Alice of the advantages of closing the deal with us now.
* **Last Attempt:** This is a final push to see if Alice will budge. If she rejects this, we'll likely take John's offer in the next round."
