"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to pay a bit more, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would still give you a good deal and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $925,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we settle on $875,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
