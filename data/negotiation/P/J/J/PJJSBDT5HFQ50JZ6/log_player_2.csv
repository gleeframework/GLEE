"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within my budget, but I can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to negotiate since her minimum is $1,200,000, and she likely wants to make a profit.  I'll start by rejecting her offer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but I'm not quite ready to commit to your initial price. I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer,  $200,000 lower than Alice's starting price. This demonstrates my intention to negotiate seriously while still staying within my budget. I've also added a message that emphasizes the value to both of us, hoping to appeal to her desire to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,350,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. What are your thoughts on this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000 than her original price of $1,200,000, and it's still within my budget.  Continuing to negotiate might save a little more, but there's a risk Alice could become less flexible or I might end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further uncertainty."
