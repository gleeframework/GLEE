"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,350,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that. Can you meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen to get this product at the minimum, but I'm still hoping to make a little more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that. Can you meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from his minimum price.  While I can continue to counteroffer, there's a high chance we'll reach a stalemate. It's safer to sell to John now and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss of profit."
