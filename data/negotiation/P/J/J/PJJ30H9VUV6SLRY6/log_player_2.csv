# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get a better deal from John, and there's still room to negotiate with Alice. He should try to counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'll offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is still higher than what John is offering.  It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate for a small potential savings."
