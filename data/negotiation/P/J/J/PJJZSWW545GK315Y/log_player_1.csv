I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum of $12,000. This gives Bob a chance to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,250. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still ensures I make a decent profit. I believe this price might be acceptable to Bob, especially since he rejected my initial offer and likely understands the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's counteroffer of $10,800 is too low, and it's clear we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'd rather sell to John and guarantee my minimum desired profit."
