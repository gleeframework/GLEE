"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value to me creates a sense of urgency and might entice Bob to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to counter or sell to John. The goal is to maximize my profit while considering the risk of losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm aiming for a profitable deal, I won't accept such a drastic reduction from my initial offer. It's important to maintain some leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll try to find a middle ground, aiming for a price that's more acceptable to Bob while still ensuring a decent profit for me. I need to be strategic, considering the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price, further encouraging Bob to consider accepting. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. The closer we get to the final rounds, the more risk I'll take in continuing with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we try $700,000?  That's a substantial sum, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob. With only six rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting, and I need to carefully weigh the potential risk of losing the deal to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your eagerness to close the deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try $850,000. This offer is closer to your last proposal, and it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. This should encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm again highlighting the product's value to reinforce the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in finding a solution at this price, demonstrating a positive and collaborative approach.

**Next Steps:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up slightly. How about $725,000? That's a fair compromise, and it avoids dragging this negotiation out further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  With only four rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and not settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll use the remaining rounds to try and push for a higher price, while also remaining aware of the possibility of selling to John if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us.  We're close to a deal, let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm countering with a price that's a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining my leverage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing the potential win-win scenario.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""We're close to a deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm aiming to secure a deal with Bob. I'll carefully analyze his response and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. The pressure is mounting, but I'm still focused on achieving the best possible outcome for myself."
