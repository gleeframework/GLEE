"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we try $700,000?  That's a substantial sum, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your eagerness to close the deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try $850,000. This offer is closer to your last proposal, and it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up slightly. How about $725,000? That's a fair compromise, and it avoids dragging this negotiation out further.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $800,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value to both of us.  We're close to a deal, let's make it happen.",800000.0,Alice,7,
