"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, to be fair, we're still a ways apart. I can go up to $900,000, but I need to see some more movement on your end to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
