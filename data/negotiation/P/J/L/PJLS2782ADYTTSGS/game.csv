"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $900,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this price still offers great value for you, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $750,000.  How about we split the difference at $800,000? That's the lowest I can go, but it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested!",800000.0,Alice,5,
