{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make a good deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is higher than your minimum price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling like you're giving away too much.
* **It's a fair price:**  Bob values the product at $150, so $130 is a reasonable starting point. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create a bit of negotiating room while still putting the ball in Bob's court. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. He clearly values the product at $150, so there's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than his offer, to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about $115? That's still a great price considering how much you value the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $107.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $107 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum, and there's a good chance that further negotiation would only drag things out and risk losing the sale to John.  It's time to close this deal and move on."
