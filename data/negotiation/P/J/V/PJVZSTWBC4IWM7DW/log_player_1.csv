"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's valuation. Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying close to his maximum.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process, making a counteroffer more likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's aware of the product's value to both parties, suggesting he might be willing to go higher.  We'll counter with a slightly lower price to incentivize him while staying above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and show willingness to negotiate by decreasing our price.
* **Middle Ground:** Proposing $1,350,000 positions it as a fair compromise.
* **Direct Approach:** We're moving towards a more direct negotiation style to expedite the process."
