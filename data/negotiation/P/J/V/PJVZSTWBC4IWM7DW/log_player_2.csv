"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, it's still higher than the product's value to her. There's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore options before jumping at the first offer."
