"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $95 is too close to John's price, and you want to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $95, you're still closer to John's price than you'd like to be. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $89.  That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering $89, which is a fair price considering your goal is to save as much money as possible. It's a good deal compared to John's offer of $100."
