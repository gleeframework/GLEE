"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$20,000 is way too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my maximum budget is $8,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than $20,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal. He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to accept his $8,000 offer. If he can't, he can always buy the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's finalize this deal at $8,000 and move forward."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one final compromise at $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating for a while and is getting closer to his target, but Alice is still not willing to budge. While $9,500 is better than previous offers, it is still outside Bob's budget. Since Bob has only three rounds left, it is more sensible to buy from John, who is offering the product at $8,000, which perfectly fits Bob's budget."
