"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in this product but my maximum budget is $8,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's finalize this deal at $8,000 and move forward.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one final compromise at $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,7,
