"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm asking $130 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is only worth $120 to you, and she's asking for $130. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your budget:**  This offer is still below your maximum price point of $120.
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $115 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing you're serious about buying but also seeking a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While she's come down, it's still above your maximum price point of $120.
* **You have a better alternative.** You can buy the product from John for $120, which is a better deal. However, there's still room to negotiate with Alice, so you'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is your final offer, as it matches your maximum price point.
* **Appealing to compromise:**  You're suggesting a middle ground, which can be persuasive in negotiations. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the desire to close the deal, potentially prompting Alice to accept."
