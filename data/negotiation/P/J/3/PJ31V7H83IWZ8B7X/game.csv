"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll gain. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm willing to pay.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive and it allows me to stay closer to my own valuation.  Let's close this deal!",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,425,000, but I need to be honest, I'm getting close to considering John's offer. I'd like to try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
