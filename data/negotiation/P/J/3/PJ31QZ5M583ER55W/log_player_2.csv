# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. I understand its significance and appreciate your interest. My offer for this exceptional item is $950,000. I believe this price reflects the quality and worth of the product while ensuring a fair return for me. I look forward to discussing the details and potentially securing this transaction with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John."
