"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about getting a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $10250. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $11000, and I'll throw in a premium service package worth $500. This way, you'll get the product and some extra value on top of it. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the premium service package, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final offer of $10000. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
