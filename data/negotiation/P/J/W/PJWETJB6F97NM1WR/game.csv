"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in your product, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we're both seeing in the product.  What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,6,
