"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more! Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, he can start negotiating a lower price with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in your product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11000 is closer, it's still a bit below my target. How about $11500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we're both seeing in the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11250 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11375.  It's a fair price, and I'm eager to close this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. He has already rejected Alice's last offer and with only 3 rounds remaining, he's unlikely to get a better price from Alice.  John's offer is the best deal available."
