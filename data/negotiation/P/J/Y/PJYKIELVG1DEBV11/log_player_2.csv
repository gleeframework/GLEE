"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $15,000 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys our interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $11,000 is below its true value. Could we agree on $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I find acceptable. However, there's still room for negotiation before reaching my $15,000 fallback option. I'll continue the bargaining to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $12,000, we're proposing a compromise that splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($12,500) and our previous counteroffer ($11,000). 
* **Maintaining Interest:** We're still expressing willingness to purchase and negotiate, aiming to keep the conversation going without appearing overly aggressive in our bargaining."
