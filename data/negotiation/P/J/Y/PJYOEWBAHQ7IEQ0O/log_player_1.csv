Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a profit for Bob ($100,000) while securing a significant gain for me ($200,000 above my minimum).
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer without trying to negotiate a lower price."
