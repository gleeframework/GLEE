"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm definitely interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this incredible product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $1,050,000.  If that's acceptable, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
