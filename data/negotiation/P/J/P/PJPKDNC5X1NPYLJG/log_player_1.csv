Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. Aim for a price that gives both of you a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a win-win, allowing you to benefit greatly while recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Positive Message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer.
* **Strong Price Point:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, a significant incentive to accept, while netting you a $150,000 profit over your fallback option.
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:**  Positioning the offer as mutually beneficial encourages Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob could counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy while keeping your minimum price in mind."
