"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $16,000 to start. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $16,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
