"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for negotiation. I believe $90 is a reasonable starting point, given that I'm willing to pay $100 from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $100.  While it's closer, I'm still willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $105, which is still within my budget and shows I'm serious about making a deal. This is a compromise, hoping to meet Alice halfway while still saving some money compared to her offer."
