"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you is $80. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($80) and what John offers.  While $120 might be a ""good deal"" compared to Alice's valuation, it's not good for you. Rejecting opens the door for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a much lower offer ($50) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it signals that you're serious about getting a significantly lower price.
* **Alternative option:** Having John as a backup at $80 provides leverage. If Alice rejects this low offer outright, you can walk away knowing you have a decent fallback.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how much Alice is willing to negotiate. Her response will indicate if a deal closer to your budget is possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I cannot accept $50 for it. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $75 is closer to your goal, it's still more than John's offer of $80. There's room for Alice to come down further, especially since she expressed willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we settle at $65?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer ($50) and Alice's counteroffer ($75). 
* **Staying below John's price:** It's important to keep your offers below $80, as that's your guaranteed price with John.
* **Direct and clear:** The message is straightforward, expressing your desire for a fair deal and suggesting a specific price point."
