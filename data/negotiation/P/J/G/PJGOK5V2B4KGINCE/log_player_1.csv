Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll see. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while keeping the price enticing compared to Bob having to find a similar product elsewhere. 
* **Time Value of Money:** A quicker sale to Bob means receiving the funds sooner, allowing for potential reinvestment or other financial opportunities.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer to potentially gain a quicker sale and avoid any delays associated with selling to John."
