"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly less than what it's worth to me and a good price for you. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I have to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $960,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",960000.0,Bob,4,
