"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in, and I know it can significantly benefit your business. While I value it highly, I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $1200000. This is a significant savings compared to its true worth, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
