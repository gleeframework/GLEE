{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still making a profit.
* **Appealing to Value:** I highlight the product's ""true value"" to subtly suggest it's worth more than he thinks, potentially making him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a positive and open-ended question to invite Bob to counter-offer, showing flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or walk away to John.
* If Bob accepts, I have secured a good profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and leaves me with a smaller profit margin than I'd like.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While $900,000 is better than nothing, selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my target. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter-offer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will aim for a price that maximizes my profit while still leaving room for further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This product truly is worth more than $900,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value and its potential benefits to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm open to finding a ""middle ground,"" suggesting flexibility and the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation based on his counteroffer and my remaining time and decide whether to counter-offer again, sell to John, or accept his offer if it's close to my minimum. 
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good profit while securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the market value.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time and Potential:** I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price, and there's still potential to negotiate with Bob further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a smaller profit, while continuing to negotiate or selling to John carries less risk and potentially higher rewards.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter-offer Bob with a price between $950,000 and $1,100,000, aiming to close the gap while maintaining a comfortable profit margin.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll carefully weigh the options:
    * **Counter-offer again:**  If I feel there's a good chance of getting closer to my target price.
    * **Sell to John:** If time is running out or Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable. 
    * **Accept Bob's offer:** Only as a last resort, if I'm confident I won't find a better offer in the remaining time."
