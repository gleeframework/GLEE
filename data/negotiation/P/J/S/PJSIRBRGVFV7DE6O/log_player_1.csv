Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $8,000, Bob values it at $12,000. There's a window to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob saves $2,000 compared to his perceived value, and you gain an extra $2,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is concise and highlights the value proposition for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
