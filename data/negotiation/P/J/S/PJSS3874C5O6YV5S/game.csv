"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it could bring to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
