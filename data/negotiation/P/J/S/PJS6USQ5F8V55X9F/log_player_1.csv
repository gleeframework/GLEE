{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal and expressing confidence in its value for Bob. This aims to make him more receptive.
* **Room for counteroffers:** Leaving space for Bob to counteroffer ensures the negotiation can progress.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **Accept my offer:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **Counteroffer:**  Analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide:
    * **Accept:** If the counteroffer is close to my acceptable price or higher.
    * **Reject & Counter:** If the counteroffer is too low, I'll counter with a slightly reduced price.
    * **Reject & Sell to John:**  If Bob's counteroffer is unacceptable, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving some room for compromise.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I might be able to get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This will allow me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer is higher than Bob's but lower than my previous offer.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlight the value:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Keep the door open:** My message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to continue the discussion and potentially reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a price closer to my goal. 
* **Bob rejects and counteroffers:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide:
    * **Accept:**  If his counteroffer is close to my minimum or higher.
    * **Reject and counter:** If his offer is still too low, I'll make a final counteroffer before potentially selling to John. 
    * **Reject and sell to John:**  If his counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but still low:**  $10,200 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still a significant distance away.  
* **Opportunity for a final counter:** I believe I can still push for a higher price.  A small counteroffer might be enough to secure a deal closer to my desired range.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I'm confident I can get a better price with one more counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's, leaving a small margin for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,200 is close, but I need to be at least $10,500 to make this work for me.  I'm willing to accept $10,500 as my final offer.  This is the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final counteroffer:** This is my final offer, leaving little room for further negotiation. 
* **Small increase:** The counteroffer is only $300 higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a slightly better price.
* **Clear message:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Risk assessment:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've secured a price above my initial counteroffers and still well above Bob's first offer.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

* **No further negotiation:**  Bob has clearly stated he's unwilling to go higher, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
