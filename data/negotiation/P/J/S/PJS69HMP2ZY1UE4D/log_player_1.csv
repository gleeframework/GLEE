"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. It's also a strong opening offer that shows I'm serious about selling but also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $1,000,000. I know the product is worth more to him, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still holding firm on my desired price. I believe this compromise will be attractive to Bob and lead us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and it's getting too risky to continue negotiating with him.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but if he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. If Bob rejects this, I will likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's not budging much, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a deal completely."
