"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your initial offer, $12,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. Could you do $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $18,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
