"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's true interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""immense value and potential,"" I'm framing the product in a positive light without revealing specific reasons behind my high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've made it clear that I'm willing to negotiate (""find a mutually beneficial agreement""), signaling to Bob that I'm flexible and open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to my desired range. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my fallback option, but I'll explore negotiating with Bob further before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you recognize the value of this product.  While $2,300,000 represents a premium price for its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging and Appreciating:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer and appreciating his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm subtly reiterating the product's high value by connecting it to a ""premium price"" due to its ""unique qualities.""
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease of $200,000 from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it's a calculated move, still keeping the price well above my minimum and aiming to guide Bob closer to $2,000,000.
* **Focusing on Value, Not Just Price:** I'm highlighting the ""return on investment"" Bob will gain, shifting the focus from the upfront cost to the long-term benefits, which could potentially justify a higher price in his mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offers, but we are still far apart. He needs to make a more substantial jump to make it worthwhile to continue negotiations. I'm willing to counteroffer again to see if I can draw him closer to $2 million. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative if the gap remains too wide."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be frank, $1,700,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to make one more move and offer it for $1,950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** I'm shifting to a more direct tone, indicating that the negotiation can't continue indefinitely. I'm stating that $1,700,000 is simply too low.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting $1,950,000 as my ""final offer"" and a ""compromise,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** I'm still aiming for a price that provides a good profit margin, but I'm also aware that if Bob rejects this, accepting John's offer might be the most logical choice to avoid potentially wasting more time in a drawn-out negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to meet my price expectations.  His increase to $1,750,000 is insignificant, and his ultimatum suggests he's not likely to move much higher. 

While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get an offer significantly closer to my $1,950,000 mark.  Accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 

Therefore, the most rational decision at this point is to cut my losses, accept John's offer, and move forward.  This guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price and avoids wasting further time and energy on a negotiation that's unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
