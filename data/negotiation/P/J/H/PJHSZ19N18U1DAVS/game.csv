"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. I'll sell it to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. I'll sell it to you for $1050000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 30-day money-back guarantee. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $1050000. I'll meet you at $980000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000",980000.0,Bob,6,
