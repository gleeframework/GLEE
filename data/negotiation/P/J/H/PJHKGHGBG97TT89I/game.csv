"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is a tempting offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and our previous discussions. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $812,500.  This is my final offer. I believe it's fair considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and the market value. I'm willing to make one more offer, and if it's not accepted, I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000.",795000.0,Bob,6,
