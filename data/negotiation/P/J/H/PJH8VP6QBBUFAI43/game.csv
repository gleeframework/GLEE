"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $750,000 is simply too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and gives you a significant saving compared to your initial valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
