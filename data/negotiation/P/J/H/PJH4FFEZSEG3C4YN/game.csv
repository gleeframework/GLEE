"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering its usual price is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not quite comfortable with the $7,000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is still a great deal, considering its usual price is $8,000. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit lower on the price. How about we meet in the middle from your last offer at $7,125?",7125.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is still a great deal, considering its usual price is $8,000. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,100. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",7100.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're still trying to negotiate at this point. I'm not willing to go below $7,000, and I think that's already a very good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,050. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",7050.0,Alice,9,
