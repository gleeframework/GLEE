Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000, but we don't want to sell it for less than our minimum ($15,000).
* **Starting High:** We start with a price higher than Bob's valuation but potentially within a negotiable range.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so we are not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If we knew he was prone to accepting the first offer, we might start even higher.
* **Relationship Building:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, we might adjust our approach to be less aggressive."
