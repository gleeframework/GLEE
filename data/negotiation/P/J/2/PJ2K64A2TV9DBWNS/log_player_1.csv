"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and concessions. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""value and potential"" and the benefits to Bob's business, the aim is to anchor his perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a significant potential profit in securing a deal with Bob above that price. This initial offer leaves ample room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's worth negotiating further, but keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I can consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and the long-term benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Reduction:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still anchoring the price well above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  By continuing to emphasize the product's ""unique capabilities"" and ""long-term benefits,"" the goal is to justify the price and shift Bob's focus away from his initial low offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation over the remaining rounds while keeping us within a potentially profitable range above John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still not feasible for me. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to make a more significant adjustment, I'm still interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob's offer remaining at his perceived value ($1,000,000) suggests this is a critical point in the negotiation. Accepting now would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.
* **Negotiating Leverage:** We still have several rounds left, and John's offer provides a safety net. Rejecting this offer maintains the pressure on Bob to move closer to our desired range. 
* **Towards a Compromise:** By rejecting, we signal that a more substantial compromise is needed from both sides for the deal to progress. The next counteroffer will be crucial in determining if an agreement with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find an agreement that works for us both. To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my desire to work with you.  I believe this price represents a fair and mutually beneficial opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer drops below the midpoint between the previous offer and Bob's price, signaling a significant willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Collaboration:** The message highlights a ""desire to work with"" Bob, framing the negotiation as a joint effort rather than a battle.
* **Justification and Finality:**  By calling it a ""fair and mutually beneficial opportunity,"" the aim is to subtly nudge Bob towards a deal while still maintaining a price significantly above John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:** With half the rounds remaining, this offer aims to inject urgency and encourage Bob to make a counter-proposal closer to the desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a strong offer, and I need to see a similar level of flexibility from you to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Compromise:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant move from his previous position and represents a substantial profit above John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While holding out for a higher price is tempting, further negotiation risks alienating Bob and potentially leading to a deadlock. The time and effort spent on securing an incrementally better deal might not outweigh the benefits of accepting now.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Accepting at this point locks in a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob reducing his offer or the negotiation breaking down entirely in the remaining rounds."
