Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially go higher if Bob is willing. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $125? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum value of $150. You're better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more though. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that you're still willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your previous offer:** This shows you're flexible. 
* **It's still above your minimum value:** You're still making a profit. 

By counter-offering at $135, you're demonstrating that you're willing to meet Bob halfway, while still protecting your interests."
