"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $125? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more though. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget than John's offer of $120.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept and secure the product at a price that's relatively close to his limit. Further negotiation might risk losing the product to another buyer or delaying the purchase."
