"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to still generate a significant return on investment. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's not quite in line with the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still allow for a strong return on investment for you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,300,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to still generate a decent return on investment. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
