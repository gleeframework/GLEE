Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, it's not quite in line with the value I believe this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I propose a price of $1,300,000.  This would still allow for a strong return on investment for you, while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach an agreement.
