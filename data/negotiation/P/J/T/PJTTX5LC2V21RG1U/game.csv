"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a great value for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
