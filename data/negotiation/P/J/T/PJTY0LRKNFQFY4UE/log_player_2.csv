"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer helps establish a baseline for negotiation. While $6,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's asking price, it leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you halfway at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum acceptable price, which is also a great deal for us (saving $2,000 from John's price). There's no guarantee of securing a better deal in further rounds, and we risk Alice withdrawing the offer or reaching an impasse."
