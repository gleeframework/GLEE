Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I see its potential,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your budget considerations, the value of this product is truly significant and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is a significant move from my previous offer, showing my commitment to closing this deal. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move towards my price, and we're getting closer to a potential deal. Accepting $875,000 is tempting, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to push him a bit further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment for you, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This reflects the value I place on finding the right buyer for this unique product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000.  This shows my seriousness about acquiring the product, and it allows us to meet halfway. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $885,000 is a solid compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and keeps a good profit margin.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, and I'd rather secure a good deal now than potentially lose him as a buyer."
