"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly above your ideal price.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Alice is open to discussion, indicating that there's room to lower the price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You can always buy from John if negotiations fail, so there's no need to rush into Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I see its potential,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your budget considerations, the value of this product is truly significant and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight decrease, $925,000 is still above my ideal price point.  
* **More negotiation is possible.**  Alice is willing to compromise, so there's still room for further price reduction.
* **John's offer is still a fallback.** It's important to keep that option open in case negotiations with Alice break down."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is a significant move from my previous offer, showing my commitment to closing this deal. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment for you, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This reflects the value I place on finding the right buyer for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  It's closer to your ideal price, but you're still aiming to save more.
* **More negotiation is possible.** Alice has said this is her final offer, but you can still try to push for a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safe fallback.** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail.  

**Strategy for Next Round:**

In the next round, you can try a counteroffer close to $875,000, perhaps offering $880,000 or $885,000. Explain that this represents a significant investment for you, and you're confident that this is a fair price given the value of the product.  You're also demonstrating that you're serious about closing the deal, but you need a price that works within your budget."
