"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I see its potential,  $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it gives us both room to negotiate.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your budget considerations, the value of this product is truly significant and $850,000 falls short of what I believe is fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This feels like a strong compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This is a significant move from my previous offer, showing my commitment to closing this deal. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment for you, but this product truly is exceptional. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This reflects the value I place on finding the right buyer for this unique product.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but $900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $885,000.  This shows my seriousness about acquiring the product, and it allows us to meet halfway. Let's work together to make this happen.",885000.0,Bob,6,
