"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is still within your stated value, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet halfway and seal the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is the highest I can stretch within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
