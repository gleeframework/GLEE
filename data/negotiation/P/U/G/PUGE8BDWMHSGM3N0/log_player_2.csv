"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:** $13,000
* **John's price:** $15,000
* **Bob's maximum:** $15,000

Accepting Alice's offer is the best option. It saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John and still gets him the product. While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
