Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
