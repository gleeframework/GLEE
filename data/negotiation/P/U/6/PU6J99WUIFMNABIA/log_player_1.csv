Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Above Guaranteed Sale:** The offer is significantly higher than John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who values the product more, while still guaranteeing a substantial profit if he declines."
