Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale price).
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" adds perceived value, making the high price more palatable.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he outright rejects the offer or counters too low, you always have the safety net of John's $1,200,000 offer."
