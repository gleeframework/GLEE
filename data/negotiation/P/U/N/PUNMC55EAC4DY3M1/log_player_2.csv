"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $13,500. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer ($6,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move on price. This anchors the negotiation in my favor.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I know I can go up to $8,000 if needed, so this offer leaves me with bargaining space.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite but makes it clear that $13,500 is completely unreasonable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $11,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $11,000 is still significantly above my $8,000 limit and leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Testing the ""Final Offer"":** By rejecting this, I'm calling Alice's bluff on it being her final offer. She might be more flexible than she's letting on.
* **John is my Safety Net:**  I'm comfortable walking away because I know I can get the product from John for a reasonable price."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still outside my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000, but that's really as high as I can go. It's a fair offer, considering I could get it elsewhere for a bit less."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer, But Within Budget:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by increasing my offer, but I'm staying firmly within my $8,000 limit. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  By mentioning that I have another option for less, I'm creating a sense of urgency and subtly pressuring Alice to negotiate.
* **Final Offer (Almost):**  While I don't explicitly say it's my final offer, $7,000 is my target price. I'm prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept."
