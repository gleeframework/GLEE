"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $115. This is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm willing to pay more than my target.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $125, which is the best I can do. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
