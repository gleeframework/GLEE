"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $100. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also trying to be friendly and persuasive to encourage him to accept the offer.  If Bob rejects, I'll have more information about his potential maximum value for the product and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's too risky to accept such a low offer, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further in the next round to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a great price for such a valuable product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the product's value to hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  How about $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to get this deal finalized.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm now offering $80, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price and expressing my desire to finalize the deal.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
