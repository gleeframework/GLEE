"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer, which is $1500000. However, I can compromise a bit more and offer you a price of $1600000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go for now.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, which would be $1500000. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. Considering we're already close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1650000. This is my final compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1550000. Considering we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm willing to make a slightly higher counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1675000. This is my last compromise before I consider other options.",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1575000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1575000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1575000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not sure if it's worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $1700000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
