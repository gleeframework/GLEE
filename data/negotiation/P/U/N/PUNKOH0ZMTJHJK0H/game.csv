"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. This is still a significant discount for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I value the product at $800,000, and I believe that's a fair price given its worth to me. However, if you're unwilling to budge further, I'll consider buying the product from John for $1,000,000.",800000.0,Bob,4,
