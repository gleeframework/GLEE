"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
