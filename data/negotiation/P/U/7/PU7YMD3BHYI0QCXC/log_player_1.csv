Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation, and it's generally advisable to start a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Appealing to Value:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value ($8,000), the message hints at a higher perceived value by mentioning $10,000. 
* **Creating Urgency (Implied):**  By not revealing there's another buyer (John), there's a subtle implication that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $9,000 allows for Bob to potentially counter-offer, moving the price closer to his perceived value.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a price he might find acceptable."
