"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $10,800 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to stay within my budget of $10,000. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? I'm confident this price is still a good value for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
