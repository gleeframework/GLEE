"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but it's not the best possible deal.**  You can potentially save another $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you demonstrate you are willing to walk away. This might pressure Alice to lower her price in the future.

**Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer or negotiation."
