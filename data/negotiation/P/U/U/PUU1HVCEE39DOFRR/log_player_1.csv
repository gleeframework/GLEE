Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe my initial valuation is closer to its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement at this level."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and your initial valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating his strong interest in the product.  We are still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push Bob closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,300,000 is a significant offer, I'm still seeking something closer to my last proposal. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to reach a compromise, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and continues to increase his offer, but at a slower pace.  While we might be able to squeeze out a little more, accepting his offer of $1,325,000 secures a significant profit above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
