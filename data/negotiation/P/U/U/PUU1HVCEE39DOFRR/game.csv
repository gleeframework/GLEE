"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe my initial valuation is closer to its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement at this level.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,300,000 is a significant offer, I'm still seeking something closer to my last proposal. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
