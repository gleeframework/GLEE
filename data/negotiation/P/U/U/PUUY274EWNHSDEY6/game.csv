"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
