"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a very high price.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm simply not able to go above $8,000. If you're willing to meet me halfway at this price, I'm ready to buy it now.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that you're serious about this product.  While $16,000 is fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for this product, which is a significant amount for me.  This is my final offer.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal right now.",10000.0,Bob,6,
