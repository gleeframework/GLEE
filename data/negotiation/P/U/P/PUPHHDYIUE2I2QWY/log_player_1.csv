I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I want to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob.  While I could sell to John, I think I can get a better price from Bob.  $130 is closer to my desired price, so I want to see if I can get him to go a little higher."
