"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is the price I'd get from John, so there's no incentive for me to settle for less. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and below the value he places on the product. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's initial offer, which might make him more likely to negotiate. I'm leaving some room for further negotiation, but I won't go lower than $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering below my minimum acceptable price, even though he's increased his offer. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not yet ready to accept an offer below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. We're running out of rounds, so I'll continue to negotiate but keep John as a backup option.  I will continue to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm offering $1,125,000, which is still above Bob's latest offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me in the middle. We have fewer rounds remaining, and I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call! Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price.  However, we're close to the end of the negotiation rounds and there's a chance we won't reach an agreement in the next two rounds. It's better to secure a deal now for $1,100,000 than risk getting nothing or having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
