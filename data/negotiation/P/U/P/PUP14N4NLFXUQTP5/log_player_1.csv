"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value the product brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting the value this product brings to your business.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think there's room for negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can secure a better price by counteroffering. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can reach a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, which is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my target of $900,000. We're already in the latter half of the rounds, so I need to start closing the deal. However, with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, so I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to secure a price as close as possible to $890,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $880,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's close this deal with this final offer."", ""product_price"": 885000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $885,000. I'm willing to meet you at $882,500, which is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last few rounds, and while $882,500 is slightly lower than my desired price, it's still a significantly better deal than selling to John. There's a high risk that Bob will reject my next offer, and we might not be able to reach a deal. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure a sale at a price that's still favorable."
