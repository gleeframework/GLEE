"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value for that price, considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance of negotiating a lower price, considering your budget and John's backup offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer but is still comfortably above her perceived value of the product. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed while aiming for a price that's beneficial for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $7,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you do $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price that seems like a bargain. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good value, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to end the negotiation quickly. We're offering Alice her perceived value for the product, which is a fair deal. It also keeps us well below our maximum budget and John's alternative offer."
