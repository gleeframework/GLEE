Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to get a good deal.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $7,750, and you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation for such a small potential gain."
