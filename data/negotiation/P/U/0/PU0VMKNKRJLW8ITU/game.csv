"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This offer is still within a reasonable range, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $1,300,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. I truly believe this product has significant value, and I'm confident this price will allow for a successful transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,375,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
