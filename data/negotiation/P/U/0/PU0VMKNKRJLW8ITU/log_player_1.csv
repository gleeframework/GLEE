Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000.  This offer is still within a reasonable range, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,350,000. I truly believe this product has significant value, and I'm confident this price will allow for a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above our minimum price and there's room for negotiation. It's worth pushing a little further to try and secure a better deal."
