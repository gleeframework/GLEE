Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because John acts as a safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**
    *  Keeps the tone positive and collaborative. 
    *  Highlights ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to emphasize the product's desirability. 
    *  Ends with an open question to encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, giving you room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You might need to adjust your price slightly to reach an agreement. 
* **Information is Power:** In real negotiations, gathering information about Bob's needs and constraints would give you an even stronger position."
