"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is unfortunately way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To make this work, I could come down to $19,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $8,000.  Is there any flexibility on your end to get closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $8,000 is still much lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider a significant move if it means closing the deal. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
