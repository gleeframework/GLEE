"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than what John is selling for, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, I'm not quite ready to pay that much. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $9,000 is less than $10,000, making Alice's offer more appealing.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.

It's a good idea to accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a price lower than John's, while still saving some money."
