{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000):** You're still getting a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's estimated value ($10,000):** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 

By offering this price, you're setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, there's still room to negotiate. You can potentially get closer to your desired price ($9,500) by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  Selling to John right now would be giving up potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,250.  This is still a fair price given the value of the product, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin.
* **Fairness:** $9,250 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his estimated value of $10,000.
* **Motivational Message:** The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're closing in on a fair price. I would like to propose $9,100 as my final offer for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,100 is slightly less than your ideal price, it's still a good deal considering:

* **Bob's likely final offer:** He's already lowered his offer significantly and may not budge much further.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Alternative buyer:** John's offer of $8,000 is less than what Bob is offering.

It's time to accept the offer and secure a sale that is close to your desired price."
