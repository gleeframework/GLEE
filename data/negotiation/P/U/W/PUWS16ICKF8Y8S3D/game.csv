"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $9,000.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll take $10,000 for it. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price. $10,000 is still a bit high for me though.  How about $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about buying this.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $9,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and lets us close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
