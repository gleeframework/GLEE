"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers its true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I recognize you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make a significant move and consider $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than reasonable price considering the value you'll be gaining.",950000.0,Alice,5,
