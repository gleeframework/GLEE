"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your operations.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",920000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $935000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. I believe this is a good compromise. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $935000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $915000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I am too.  I'm willing to come down to $925000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.  We're both close to a deal, and I don't want to lose this opportunity.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and my previous offer of $915000. I'll pay $920000 for the product. This is my final offer.",920000.0,Bob,6,
