"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $140. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
