{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget. Would you be able to consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget. While $100 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still hoping to find a way to purchase this product for closer to my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $105? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still taking advantage of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm not confident Bob will go higher, and I don't want to risk a long negotiation.  John's offer is my guaranteed minimum, so I'm going to take it."
