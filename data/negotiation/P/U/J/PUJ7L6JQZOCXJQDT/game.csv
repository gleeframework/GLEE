"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I believe it could be valuable for my business. However, I can only offer $800000 for it at this time. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $800000 is far below what I need to make this worthwhile, I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can find common ground. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This still reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1200000 is still above my budget, I'm ready to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the potential value of this product for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
