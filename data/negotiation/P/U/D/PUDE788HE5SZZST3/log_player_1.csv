"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the potential value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. It's not worth selling to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement, hoping to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $85 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob in the hope of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is still not workable for me. Let's compromise at $80. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm aiming for a compromise at $80, which is still above my minimum price but might be acceptable for Bob given our previous rounds of negotiation. I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the compromise offered."
