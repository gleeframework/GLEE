"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$750,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get it lower before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows my willingness to negotiate and hopefully pushes Alice to come down from her initial position. I believe $600,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is closer to my target, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can get it lower with another counteroffer.  I'm not yet at a point where buying from John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows I'm willing to move a bit, but I'm still holding firm on trying to get a better price.  I'm hoping this will bring Alice closer to my target price without going too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $725,000 is tempting, I still want to see if I can get a better deal. Alice has already moved closer to my counteroffer, so I think there's still room for further negotiation. Buying from John at this point would be a worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only by a small amount. This demonstrates that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, but I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Alice and bring us closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has gone back to her original offer. While I'm tempted to accept, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe I can get it closer to my target with another counteroffer. Buying from John at this point is a worse deal, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer hasn't changed, so I'm going to increase my counteroffer again. I believe $700,000 is a fair compromise that's within my budget and hopefully appealing enough to Alice.  I'm nearing the end of the negotiation, so I need to find a deal that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are approaching the end of the negotiations and Alice is not showing signs of coming down much further.  While I still believe I could potentially negotiate a slightly better price, the risk of not closing the deal at all is too high at this point.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the best option to guarantee I get the product within my budget."
