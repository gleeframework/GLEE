"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $1,290,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,290,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,285,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. What do you think?",1285000.0,Alice,7,
