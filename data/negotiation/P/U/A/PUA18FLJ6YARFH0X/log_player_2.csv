"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($12,000)** is better than your alternative of buying from John for $15,000.
* You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so getting it for $12,000 saves you $3,000."
