"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's performance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000.

While Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob time to potentially reach a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to his budget, he's still $50,000 above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to counter-offer and potentially get a better deal.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so he has time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $830,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $845,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $845,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now gone through 7 rounds of negotiations with Alice.  Despite his efforts to negotiate a lower price, Alice is still offering $845,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  

With only 3 rounds remaining, the chances of Alice dropping her price to Bob's desired level are slim.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially losing more time with further negotiations."
