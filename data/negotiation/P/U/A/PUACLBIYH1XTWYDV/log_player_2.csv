"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, aiming to find a middle ground. This is a significant reduction, but it's still within a range where both of us might find a deal acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,250 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if I can get the price down to a point where it's worth buying from Alice rather than John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $8,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget limit of $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm framing it as a fair price that benefits both of us.  It's worth seeing if Alice will finally accept my offer."
