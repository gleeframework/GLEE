# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.

This is the best option for a few reasons:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice has stated this is her lowest price. Continuing to negotiate might frustrate her and jeopardize the deal.
* **Fair Price:**  $800,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 offer.
* **Limited Rounds:**  You only have 10 rounds, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
