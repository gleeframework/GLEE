Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $11,000 is a good price for him, as he's willing to pay up to $12,000.  While he might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his next offer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
