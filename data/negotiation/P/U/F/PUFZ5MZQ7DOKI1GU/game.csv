"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Let's start with $1,250,000 and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
