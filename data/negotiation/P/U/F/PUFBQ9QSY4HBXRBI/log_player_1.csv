"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good outcome.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob, making it seem like a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for a deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining control:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $145? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by much. This signals that I'm open to negotiation, but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $145 is still a good deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as something that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close to John's offer:**  I'm getting closer to John's offer of $150. It's worth seeing if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob before selling to John.
* **Potential for a deal:** I'm not ready to give up on Bob completely. There's still a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by coming down in price, but still maintaining a good margin for myself.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""fair price"" to emphasize that this offer is mutually beneficial.
* **Urgency (Subtle):** Mentioning closing the deal adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to minimum:**  $135 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's not a terrible deal, I'm not convinced I can squeeze out much more from Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a reliable buyer, and I know he'll pay me $150. This is a guaranteed outcome, with no risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** We've already had five rounds of negotiation, and with only five rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with either buyer is increasing. 

Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome at this point."
