"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying if the price was closer to $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'll try to find a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,5,
