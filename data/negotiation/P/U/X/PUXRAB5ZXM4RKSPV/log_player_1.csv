"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" framing it as a premium opportunity rather than a mere commodity.  
* **Alternative:** I'm aware of John's standing offer of $1,000,000. While this is my safety net, I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There are 8 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a price closer to my target.
* **John as Leverage:**  John's standing offer acts as a safety net, giving me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more realistic proposal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, the counteroffer remains well above both Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's high value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer creates a sense of fairness and encourages him to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I can go up to $950,000. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is nearing my $1,000,000 threshold.
* **Potential Upside:** With 6 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room to negotiate a slightly better price from Bob, especially as he seems motivated to close the deal. 
* **John as Leverage:** I'll continue using John's offer as leverage, but I'll need to start making smaller concessions to incentivize Bob to move closer to my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by a smaller increment ($100,000), signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Justification:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to meet me near the middle ground.
* **Time Pressure:** While I have time remaining, I want to apply some subtle pressure to close the deal sooner rather than later. Bob might be more willing to concede as we get closer to the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us to both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firmly anchored at $950,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $1,000,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge the gap.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. Time is valuable, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed profit than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation that might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Certainty:** John's offer provides a sure thing, eliminating uncertainty and potential for Bob to walk away later in the negotiation."
