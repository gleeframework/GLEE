"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more realistic proposal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I can go up to $950,000. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
