"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$50 is a great deal, but I can potentially get it for even cheaper.  There's no harm in rejecting the offer and seeing if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground. I'm confident I can get the product for less than $50, and $35 is a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $40 is still a good price, I'm still hoping to get it for lower. I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she rejected my counteroffer.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 38}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her price to $40.  I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $38, which is still lower than her current offer but shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  This should encourage her to make another concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $45, which is higher than my last counteroffer of $38, but still a good deal compared to John's price of $120.  Since we're at round 5, I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  I'm going to accept this offer, as it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and I don't want to risk ending up paying John's higher price."
