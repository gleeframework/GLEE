{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This presents a significant return on investment for you, considering its worth to you. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Option:** It's important to remember that there's a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John if Bob refuses. This offer ensures a significant profit regardless."
