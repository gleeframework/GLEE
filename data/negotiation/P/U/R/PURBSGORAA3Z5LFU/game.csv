"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand you're working within a budget.  However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows for a profit for me, while giving you a good price on a valuable product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $850,000. Can we make a deal at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can we make a deal at this price?",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $875,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  It's important that we find a price that reflects its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. This is my final offer before I move forward with another buyer.  Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I've already made a significant concession by offering $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,8,
