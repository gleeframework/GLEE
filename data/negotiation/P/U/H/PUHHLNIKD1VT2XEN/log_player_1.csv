Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high ($1,150,000) leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and Alice can still potentially meet her desired minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer, and a successful negotiation often involves multiple exchanges to find a mutually agreeable price."
