This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also frames the price as fair, which can help Bob feel more comfortable considering it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a better offer than John's, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's value.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise and above my minimum.  It's time to close the deal."
