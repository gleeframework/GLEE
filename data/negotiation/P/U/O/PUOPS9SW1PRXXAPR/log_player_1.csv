This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:** This makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a final counteroffer.  I'm also factoring in the risk of Bob walking away entirely and potentially missing out on a sale."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. Would you consider $1,190,000? I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,190,000 is only slightly lower than my last counteroffer of $1,212,500.  It's also significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While I'd like to push for a higher price,  it's likely we're at a stalemate.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy to secure a sale and maximize my earnings."
