Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on your price, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $14,000? That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to wrap this up today.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $15,000. John is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk losing that sale."
