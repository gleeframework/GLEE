Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating why Bob should pay more than its worth to him. This creates an opportunity for Bob to justify a high price in his own mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and invites Bob to engage in discussion, making it more likely he'll counter-offer rather than outright rejecting the initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your approach. 
* **Market Information:** While not provided, knowing if the product has a broader market or competitors would influence your strategy."
