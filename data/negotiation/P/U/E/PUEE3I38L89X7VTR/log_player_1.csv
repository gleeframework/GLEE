I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
