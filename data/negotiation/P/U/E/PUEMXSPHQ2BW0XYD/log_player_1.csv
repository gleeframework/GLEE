Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I have to be honest, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the worth of what I'm offering."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $1,100,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
