"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I have to be honest, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the worth of what I'm offering.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I can see you're serious about this. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $1,100,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
