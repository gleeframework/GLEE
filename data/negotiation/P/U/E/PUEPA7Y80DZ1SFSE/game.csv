"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $60 is too far below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $100. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a significant step from my last offer and meets you closer to your price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a good compromise and a good price for both of us. If you're serious about buying it, let's work with this number. Otherwise, I'll have to move on.",90.0,Alice,5,
