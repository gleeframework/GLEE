{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you might be interested. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum value of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. By offering a price that's appealing to Bob, I hope to encourage him to accept the offer or counter with a reasonable price, allowing me to potentially earn a good profit.  If he rejects, I can always resort to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I am not willing to sell it for such a low price. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $60 is too far below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $100. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a significant step from my last offer and meets you closer to your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a good compromise and a good price for both of us. If you're serious about buying it, let's work with this number. Otherwise, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 90}
