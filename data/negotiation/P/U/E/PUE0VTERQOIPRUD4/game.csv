"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",87.5,Bob,10,
