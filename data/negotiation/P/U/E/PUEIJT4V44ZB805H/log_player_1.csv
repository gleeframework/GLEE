Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to move on to a sure thing."
