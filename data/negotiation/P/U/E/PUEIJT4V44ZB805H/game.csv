"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
