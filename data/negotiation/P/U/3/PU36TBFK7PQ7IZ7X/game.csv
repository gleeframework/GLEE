"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the comprehensive package you've put together. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for myself. Therefore, I am willing to consider your offer of $11,000. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $12,500 for the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
