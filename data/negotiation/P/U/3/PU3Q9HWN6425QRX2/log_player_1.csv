"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point because it's  more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm being optimistic but leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $120. How about we aim for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and see if I can get closer to my goal. $90 is better than $80, but I think I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm going to offer Bob $95. This is closer to his offer, but still leaves a bit of room for negotiation. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can get him to accept."
