# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer allows for that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,150,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's desired price range.  While Bob could attempt another counteroffer, it's likely Alice will not budge further.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price and avoid the risk of losing it to John or having to continue negotiations."
