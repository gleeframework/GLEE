{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you.  I'm starting the price at $25,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 25000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer with a price that's still a fair bit higher than what he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $20,000,  but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $20000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

This is a great opportunity! Bob's offer is exactly what I would get selling to John. I'll close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
