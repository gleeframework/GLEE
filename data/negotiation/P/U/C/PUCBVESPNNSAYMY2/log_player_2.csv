"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe could be very valuable to you.  I'm starting the price at $25000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. It's always best to start with a rejection and counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $25,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  By starting with a significantly lower counteroffer ($12,000), you're immediately setting a strong negotiating position.  This makes it clear you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Show Interest:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product while also making it clear that you're not going to pay the initial asking price. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for you to increase your offer if Alice is unwilling to come down to $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $20000,  but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting again will allow you to continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $20,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is your final offer adds pressure and makes Alice aware you're serious about this price. 
* **""Ready to Close"":**  This phrase reinforces your commitment to the deal at this price.
* **Meeting your Maximum:**  You've reached your maximum budget, so this is the highest you're willing to go.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Alice will accept or make a counteroffer closer to your budget. If she rejects, you can still go to John for $15,000, ensuring you don't overspend."
