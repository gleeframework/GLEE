"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing $1500000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
