"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1000000, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's meet at $950000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
