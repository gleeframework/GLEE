# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $15,000 is above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have 10 rounds to do so.
* Buying from John at $12,000 is a viable option, but negotiating with Alice might lead to an even better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. 
* You have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and you can still potentially get a better deal.
* Buying from John is still a viable option, but negotiating with Alice might lead to an even better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which I believe is a fair price considering our mutual interest in this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13250. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000.
* You only have 5 rounds left to negotiate, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better deal with Alice.
* Buying from John at $12,000 is the most cost-effective option, as it's within your budget and secures the product."
