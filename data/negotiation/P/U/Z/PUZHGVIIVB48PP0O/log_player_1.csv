{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for some negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It's a good balance between maximizing my potential earnings and keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
