"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for even less. By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
 
Alice has moved to $110, which is a good compromise. While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject your counteroffer and you'll end up buying from John for $150.  It's better to secure the product at $110 and save $40 compared to John."
