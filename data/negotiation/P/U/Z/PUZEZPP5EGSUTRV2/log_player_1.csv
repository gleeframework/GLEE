Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair return, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. It's a solid price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find some common ground here.
