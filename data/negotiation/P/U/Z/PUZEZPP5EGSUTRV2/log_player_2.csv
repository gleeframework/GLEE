"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's also more than the product is worth to her ($1,200,000). I will try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I've tried to price this fairly, and while $1,300,000 is tempting, it's a significant gap from what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a win-win, allowing me a fair return and you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still slightly higher than my ideal. I'll try to negotiate further to get it down closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair return, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. It's a solid price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This product has a lot of potential, and I want to make sure I'm pricing it appropriately. Would you be willing to consider $1,335,000? It's a small compromise for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,335,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,335,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,335,000 is close enough to my counteroffer of $1,325,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
