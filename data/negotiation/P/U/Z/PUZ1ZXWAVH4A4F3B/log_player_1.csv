"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price point, and still make a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,250? That would make it possible for me to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round. I'm also wary of reaching a point where selling to John becomes the more profitable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's find a compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
