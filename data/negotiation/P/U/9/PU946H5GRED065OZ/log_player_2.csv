Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $7,200 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

At this point, it's likely best to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** You're getting the product for $7,200, a saving of $800 from John's price and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate might make Alice less willing to compromise, and you risk ending up with a worse deal or having to go with John's $8,000 offer."
