"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,900 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
