"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is as low as I can go. I think it's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
