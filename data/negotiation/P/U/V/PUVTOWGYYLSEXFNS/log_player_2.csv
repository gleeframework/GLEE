Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,200, which is as low as I can go. I think it's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Alice is very close to her lowest acceptable price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $10,200 is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product altogether."
