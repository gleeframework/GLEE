"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to let it go for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product is valuable, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $75 is still a bit low. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $85. This is a good price for both of us. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
