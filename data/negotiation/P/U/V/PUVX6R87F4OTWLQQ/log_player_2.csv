"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, and likely much higher than her minimum desired price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of a potential deal. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This should hopefully trigger a counter-offer from Alice, allowing us to reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. There's room for further negotiation, and I want to explore that before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still too high.  I'm confident that with some more negotiation, I can get a better price.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 625000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I'm not willing to overpay. I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting higher, and we're running out of time.  I've already rejected her last two offers, and there's a chance she might continue to increase the price.  Buying from John is a guaranteed deal, and although it's more expensive, it's less risky and avoids further negotiation.  I'm willing to pay the premium to secure the product quickly and avoid potential delays or further price increases."
