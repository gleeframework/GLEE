{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $150 
* **Alice's offer:** $130
* **Value to Alice:** $120

Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's value:** $120
* **Bob's value:** $150

Offering $125 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value. This increases the chances of Alice accepting while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $135
* **Bob's value:** $150
* **Alice's value:** $120

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value, but still below Bob's maximum.  It is worth exploring further negotiation to try and get the price closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's last offer:** $135
* **Bob's value:** $150
* **Alice's value:** $120

This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's value but leaves room for negotiation in the next round. It is a reasonable compromise that can potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $132
* **Bob's value:** $150
* **Alice's value:** $120

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer would result in a good deal for Bob, allowing him to purchase the product for $12 less than his maximum value.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk of the deal falling apart or Alice reverting to a higher price. It's a good time to lock in the current offer and secure the purchase."
