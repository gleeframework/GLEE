"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, your price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,700,000 is still above what I'm able to spend right now. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. I can offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I've made it this far, and I'm not ready to give up yet. I can see that you're close to your maximum budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair one.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm still not comfortable going above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
