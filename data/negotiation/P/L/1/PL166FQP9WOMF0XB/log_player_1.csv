Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's no need to lowball. Starting high leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't undervalue the product.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but still offers a substantial profit for you. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially landing a price closer to $1,000,000 or higher.
* **Justification and Confidence:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in a fair deal. This can make Bob more receptive to the offer even if he doesn't initially agree with the price.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you have the leverage to negotiate down, knowing John provides a strong fallback option."
