"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am only able to consider offers within my budget range. I would like to counteroffer at $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is driven by budget, but I need you to meet me closer to my walk-away point.  $1,800,000 is the lowest I'll go.  This product has the potential to transform your business, and I wouldn't be offering it to you if I didn't truly believe that.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I understand the value of the product and the potential benefits it could bring. However, based on my financial situation, I cannot agree to a price higher than $1,600,000. I hope this meets closer to your expectations.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
