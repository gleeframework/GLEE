Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I understand the value of the product and the potential benefits it could bring. However, based on my financial situation, I cannot agree to a price higher than $1,600,000. I hope this meets closer to your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While getting $1,800,000 would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above Bob's perceived value and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely.  It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's offer, which is only slightly higher."
