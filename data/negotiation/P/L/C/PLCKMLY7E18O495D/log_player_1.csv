Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, I believe it would be very valuable for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his maximum price and matches what John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation."
