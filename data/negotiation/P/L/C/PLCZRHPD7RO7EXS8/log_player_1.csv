Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but also shows him the value I place on the product. It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000, so I don't want to be too quick to accept a low counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price but also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,900,000, Bob's offer is above my minimum price and  it's getting close to what John is offering. It's  time to close the deal before I risk losing both buyers."
