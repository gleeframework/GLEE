Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a price of $119. I believe it's a steal at this price and you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, but offering it at $120 risks Bob rejecting it and you settling for John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and makes the offer appear highly beneficial to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a tiny window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially allowing you to secure a slightly higher price."
