"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering $800,000.  This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  It's a strong opening move, and it gives Alice some room to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but I can still try to push for a lower price.  I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $825,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal.  It's a small enough increment that Alice might be willing to accept, but it also gives me room to negotiate further if she counters again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has moved closer to my offer. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I can't push for much lower without risking losing the product.  It's time to accept her offer and save $160,000 compared to buying from John."
