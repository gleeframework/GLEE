"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible. I'm confident he'll be willing to negotiate down, but I want to maximize my profit potential.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, but it still ensures I make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd prefer, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also higher than what John is offering.  Given the limited rounds, it's a good time to close the deal."
