Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still net you a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is a strong offer. It's substantially more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the ""limited-time"" and ""other buyers"" elements create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing for a possible agreement closer to your desired price."
