"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is slightly below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for a significantly better price from John ($1,000,000).  There's no need to negotiate with Alice further."
