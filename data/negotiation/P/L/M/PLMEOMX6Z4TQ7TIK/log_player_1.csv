Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's a great deal at $170. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations on the higher side. This leaves room for potential compromise and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($150). This ensures that even if Bob negotiates you down, you're still likely to make a profit.
* **Below Bob's Value:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value ($100), it's not astronomically high. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more than he initially intended, especially if you present a strong case for the product's value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have John as a backup buyer, so you have some leverage in the negotiation."
