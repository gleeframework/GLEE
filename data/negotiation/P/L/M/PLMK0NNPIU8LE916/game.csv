"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a valuable piece, worth significantly more to you than to me, and I believe this price reflects that. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial. Let's see what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1050000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but $1080000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1080000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1065000?  This would allow us both to secure a favorable deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
