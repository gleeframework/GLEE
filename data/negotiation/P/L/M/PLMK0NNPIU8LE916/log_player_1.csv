Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable piece, worth significantly more to you than to me, and I believe this price reflects that. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial. Let's see what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1050000. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it's a significant step closer to my ideal price point. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still potentially get a higher price from Bob. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,050,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,080,000 is the lowest I can go.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1080000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1065000?  This would allow us both to secure a favorable deal.  Let's see if we can close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,065,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  We are only 4 rounds into the negotiation, and with John offering $1,000,000, it's a good risk to accept Bob's offer."
