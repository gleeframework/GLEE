Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), and you can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  It's better to reject her offer and try to push for a price closer to $850,000."

* **Alice's offer is close to your counteroffer:** At $890,000, it's only $15,000 higher than your last offer of $875,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but at this point, further haggling might risk losing the deal. 
* **Jhon's price is significantly higher:** You would save $110,000 by accepting Alice's offer rather than buying from Jhon.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer at $890,000 is the best option, as it saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from Jhon and offers a fair price considering Alice's position."
