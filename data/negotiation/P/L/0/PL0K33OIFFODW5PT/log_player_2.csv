"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not a good deal for Bob. It's worth $1,200,000 to him and Alice is asking for more. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good value for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice has come down to $1,250,000. This is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000. It's still a little more than Bob would ideally want to pay, but it's a reasonable compromise."
