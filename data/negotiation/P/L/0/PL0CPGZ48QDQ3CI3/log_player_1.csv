"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Near Bob's Value:** The offer is just below Bob's perceived value, making it seem like a good deal while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate down.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach and invites Bob's feedback, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both Bob's perceived value and our desired outcome.  We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to $1,000,000. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value this product brings to your specific operations is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Justification:**  We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and slightly lower our price, demonstrating flexibility. We also reiterate the product's unique value to Bob, justifying a higher price point.
* **Strong Position:** The new offer is a strong compromise, still significantly above our minimum and leaving Bob with a substantial net gain from the deal.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** We aim to keep the negotiation moving and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Near the Finish Line:** We are getting close! Bob is inching closer, indicating he's serious about the purchase. We still have room to negotiate, and walking away now with only a $50,000 difference might be leaving money on the table. 
* **Time Remaining:** With several rounds left, we have time for another counteroffer that could potentially secure us a better deal. 

Let's keep the pressure on!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see some movement on your end as well.  Would you be willing to meet at $985,000? This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our concession size to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Call for Reciprocity:** By explicitly stating that we need ""movement"" from Bob, we're encouraging him to increase his offer.
* **Framing:**  Positioning the price as a joint ""investment"" rather than just a purchase price aims to create a sense of partnership and emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal.
* **Leaving Room:** While close to our desired range, this offer still gives us a little wiggle room for a final concession in a later round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $972,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $972,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $972,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** $972,500 is a very good price. It's significantly higher than our fallback option of selling to John ($800,000) and provides a substantial profit margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the potential gains are becoming smaller and riskier. Bob might be less willing to move now, and we don't want to jeopardize the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner.  

Sometimes, a good deal is better than holding out for a potentially perfect deal."
