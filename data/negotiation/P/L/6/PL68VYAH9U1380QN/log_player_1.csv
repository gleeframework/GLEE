Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $119 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting you even closer to your maximum potential profit.
* **Maintain Relationship:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price shows Bob you are interested in making a deal with him specifically, which can be good for future interactions. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
