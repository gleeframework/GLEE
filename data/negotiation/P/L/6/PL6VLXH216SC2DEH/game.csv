"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $900,000 is a bit outside of what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still slightly more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  I'm confident that this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and my current financial situation.  I hope you'll reconsider.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, thank you again for your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground and close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
