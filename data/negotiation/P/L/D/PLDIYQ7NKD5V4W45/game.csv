"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still outside my range.  I'm firm at $900,000. This is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. Let's settle this.  Would you consider $950,000? This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
