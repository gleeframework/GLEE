"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price from Alice. There's also the option to buy from John for $150 if Alice doesn't budge."
