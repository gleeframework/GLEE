# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that. I could consider coming down to $1,275,000.  This is a very fair offer considering its potential. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget.  However, it's closer to your desired price.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a more favorable price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  While the product's value justifies a higher price, I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what you're getting.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't go lower.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most prudent decision to buy from John. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
