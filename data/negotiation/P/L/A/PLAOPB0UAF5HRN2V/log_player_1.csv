Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a high initial offer, but it gives you a good starting point for negotiation. You can then adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you believe the product is worth. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still reflecting the value you place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now quite close to your initial asking price and is a good compromise. Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John at a lower price."
