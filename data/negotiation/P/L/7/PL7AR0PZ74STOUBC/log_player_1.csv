Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything lower.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $400,000 if he buys it from you. 
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $800,000 and $1,200,000 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept.  A common negotiation tactic is to start high and potentially negotiate down if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and focus on Bob's potential gain.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide if his counter-offer is acceptable or if you're willing to go lower. 
* **Negotiation Style:**  This example uses a collaborative tone, aiming for a win-win. You could adjust your message and price depending on your desired negotiation style."
