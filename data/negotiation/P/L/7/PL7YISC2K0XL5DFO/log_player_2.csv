"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's room for more negotiation, and he should aim for a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000, which is a significant step closer to your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he can still try to get a better deal. He's only used 5 rounds so far, and he has the option of buying from John if the negotiations fall through.  He should aim for a price closer to $9,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach an agreement, I'm sure we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick with your previous offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's getting closer to his ideal price, but $10,500 is still a bit high.  He has 3 rounds left, and he can still buy from John if negotiations break down. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit. We're both close to an agreement, let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one final offer, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. He has one round left with Alice, but her price is still too high for him. At this point, it's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with, even if it means missing out on potentially getting a slightly lower price from Alice in the final round."
