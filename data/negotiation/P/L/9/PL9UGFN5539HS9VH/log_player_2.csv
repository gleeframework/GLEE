"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum value. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to lower the price further with another counteroffer.  It's more advantageous to continue the negotiation rather than accepting this offer or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:** $1,250,000 is only $250,000 more than Bob's maximum of $1,000,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** Bob has already made several counteroffers, and there's a chance Alice might not budge further.  
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If Bob rejects this offer, he can still buy from John for $1,000,000.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,250,000 is the best choice as it secures the product while staying within a reasonable range for Bob."
