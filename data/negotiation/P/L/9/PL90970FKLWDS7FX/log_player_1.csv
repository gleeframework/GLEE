Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so he's likely to at least consider this offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** This allows for a more collaborative negotiation process rather than a hardline stance. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. It's worth trying to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $8,500 is still too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  It's a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  It emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Stay above your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a price you're comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob."
