{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, which is a good sign. However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  There are several rounds left, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from $100 to $105. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a better price. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good price. It's a significant discount from her original price of $120 and only $3 more than my last counteroffer.  With only five rounds left, it's not worth risking that she'll reject my counteroffer and potentially force me to buy from John at a higher price.  This offer represents a good balance between saving money and securing the product."
