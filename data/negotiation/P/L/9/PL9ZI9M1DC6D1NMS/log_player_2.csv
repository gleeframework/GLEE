"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it can greatly benefit you, and this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is way above your budget and Alice's initial offer is likely a negotiating tactic.  It's time to negotiate down towards your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer, we signal that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for us. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** Offering $8,000 aims to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired range. Even if Alice doesn't agree immediately, it shifts the discussion downwards.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We don't want to start too close to our $10,000 maximum, as that leaves us little room to maneuver if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $19,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $19,000 is still significantly above your $10,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests she's motivated to sell. There's likely room to negotiate further.
* **Alternative Option:** You still have the fallback option of buying from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $19,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We increase our offer to show Alice we're serious and willing to compromise.
* **Staying Below Maximum:** The $11,000 offer remains below your $10,000 maximum, leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By expressing that $19,000 is a ""stretch,"" we subtly create a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it already matches what other buyers are offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $15,000 is her final offer. This means further negotiation with her is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.
* **Above Budget:** $15,000 is still significantly above your $10,000 budget. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with.

**It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product at your target price from John.**"
