{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value, potentially making Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I'd love to hear back from you and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, but it's still closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to close the gap between us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $10,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market rate. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, it's very close and significantly higher than what he initially offered. It's a fair compromise considering the negotiation process and the risk of losing John as a buyer if I continue to reject offers. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale."
