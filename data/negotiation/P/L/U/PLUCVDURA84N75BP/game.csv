"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low, as I believe the product's value is still higher than that. I'm willing to compromise at $1,050,000, just like my previous offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
