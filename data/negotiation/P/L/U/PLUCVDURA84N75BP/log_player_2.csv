"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $300,000 discount is significant but still gives Alice some room to negotiate.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  By starting with a specific number, you signal your seriousness and intent to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left some space to move higher if needed during the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better price, as I have 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I've stated my absolute maximum price, which is still a good deal for Alice considering her minimum value is also $1,000,000.
* **Clear deadline:**  This offer clearly shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also sets a boundary for further negotiation.
* **Sets the stage for a potential final round:** If Alice rejects this offer, there's only one round left, making it more likely she'll accept or face the possibility of losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to go that low, as I believe the product's value is still higher than that. I'm willing to compromise at $1,050,000, just like my previous offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to budge from $1,050,000, and I'm unwilling to go above $1,000,000. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not finding a deal is increasing. It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget, rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on a deal altogether."
