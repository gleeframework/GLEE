"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. It's still a bit above the value you mentioned, but I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  I have 8 rounds left, so I'm willing to risk rejecting his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to the value we both know the product holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $9500. I can do $8000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly the same as what John is offering.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, time is running out. It's better to secure the deal now and guarantee a sale than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
