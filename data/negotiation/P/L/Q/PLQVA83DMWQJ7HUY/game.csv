"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I can offer you a revised price of $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
