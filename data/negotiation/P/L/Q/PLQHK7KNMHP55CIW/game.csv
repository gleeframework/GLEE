"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
