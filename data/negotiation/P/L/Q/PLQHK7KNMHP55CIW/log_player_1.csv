Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point because it shows you're confident in your product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is better than John's $12,000, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000. It seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that benefits me, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  I'll sell to John for $12,000 and secure a fair price for my product."
