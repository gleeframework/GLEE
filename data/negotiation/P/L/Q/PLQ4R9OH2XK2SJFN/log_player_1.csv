Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob is now offering the same amount as John. While I could try to push for more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk him lowering his offer in future rounds. It's better to accept a sure thing than risk losing the sale altogether."
