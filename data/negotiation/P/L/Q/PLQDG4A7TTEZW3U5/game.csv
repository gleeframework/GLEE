"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! Thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $110. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
