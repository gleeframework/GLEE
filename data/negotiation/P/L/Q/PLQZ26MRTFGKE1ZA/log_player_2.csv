"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000), but it's still more than you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $1,400,000 represents a fair valuation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is within my budget and a fair compromise.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, it's likely that the price will not drop significantly lower. Accepting her offer is the best course of action to acquire the product while saving money."
