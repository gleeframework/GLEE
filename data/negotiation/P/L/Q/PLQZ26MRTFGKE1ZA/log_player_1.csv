Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
