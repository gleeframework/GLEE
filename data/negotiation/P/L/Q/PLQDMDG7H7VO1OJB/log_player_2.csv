"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at face value. Since both of you value the product at $1,200,000, there's potential for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows us to start the negotiation process and see if Alice is willing to budge on the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it shows I'm serious about negotiating. It's also a reasonable starting point, as both of us value the product at $1,200,000. We'll see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my desired price.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer of $1,125,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between our last two positions. This demonstrates a continued effort to find a mutually agreeable price while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1140000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slowly decreasing, indicating a willingness to compromise. My counteroffer of $1,140,000 is a small increase from my previous offer.  This signals that I'm still interested in negotiating but also that I'm getting closer to my limit. It's a strategic move to try and find a middle ground and get a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price.  While the negotiations have moved, there are still rounds available, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing. Rejecting this offer keeps me in the negotiation and allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $1,180,000. I'm offering $1,150,000.  This is a significant step closer to my desired price point.  There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer as we're approaching the middle ground and there are only a couple of rounds left. It's a calculated risk, but it could lead to a successful purchase at a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original price of $1,200,000.  There is only one round left.  While it's possible to continue negotiating, it is highly unlikely Alice will budge further.  It's better to avoid risking further negotiation and secure the product at the same price from John, who is offering a guaranteed deal."
