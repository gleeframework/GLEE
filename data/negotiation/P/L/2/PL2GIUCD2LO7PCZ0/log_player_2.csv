# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a Significant Reduction:** Bob is starting with a substantial reduction from Alice's offer, showing he's serious about negotiating. 
* **Focus on Value:** Bob emphasizes his willingness to pay a fair price, suggesting that $9,500 is a good value for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Momentum:**  Bob continues to push for a lower price, showing that he's determined to find a deal that works for him.

Round 5

Let's close this deal now, and I'll take the product off your hands."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $10,400. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product.  Let's close this deal and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still $2,400 over his target price. This is the final round, and Bob has the option of buying from John for $8,000.  It's more advantageous to go with John, as he's offering the best price and guarantees the deal.  Even if Bob rejects this offer and counter-offers, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy from John."
