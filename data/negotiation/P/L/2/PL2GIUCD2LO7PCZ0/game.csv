"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $11,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,250. This would be a good compromise for both of us and get this deal done.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's aim for a final agreement here.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,750 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's close this deal now, and I'll take the product off your hands.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in this round.  Let's make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm eager to close this deal, $10,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, which is a final offer from my side.  Let's call it a day and make this happen.",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $10,400. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",10400.0,Alice,9,
