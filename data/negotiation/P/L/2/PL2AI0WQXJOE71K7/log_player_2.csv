{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move. You can potentially get a much better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, but still well within my budget. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also showing my seriousness about buying the product."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to potentially secure the product for a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $600,000 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows that I am willing to negotiate but also that I have a limit on what I am willing to pay. This strategy aims to incentivize Alice to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $625,000 is getting closer to my counteroffer. It's a good deal for me as it is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or increase her price. It's better to secure this deal and save myself the potential for a higher price later."
