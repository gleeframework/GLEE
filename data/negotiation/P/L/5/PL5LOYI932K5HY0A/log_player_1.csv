"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's my maximum budget for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  $10,000 is my minimum, but I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount and a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is too low, and I'm not willing to go that low.  At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and guarantees a sale.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
