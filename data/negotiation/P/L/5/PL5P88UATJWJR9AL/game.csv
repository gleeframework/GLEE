"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you in the long run. Let's see if we can work out a deal that benefits us both.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm afraid $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. ",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground and close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a decent profit, but $1,500,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
