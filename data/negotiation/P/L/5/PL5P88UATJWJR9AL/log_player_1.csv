Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm afraid $1,800,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the wire, and Bob's offers are getting too low.  While it's frustrating to not get the highest price, John's offer guarantees me my minimum and ensures I don't lose out entirely."
