"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a decent profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering $100. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept it. I'm hoping to get at least $95 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95. This is a final compromise. It's still a good deal for me, and I hope it's enticing enough for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'm starting to get closer to the point where selling to John for $120 becomes a more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is better than nothing, it's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob. We've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price, and there's only a small window left. Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a decent profit and removes the risk of losing out completely."
