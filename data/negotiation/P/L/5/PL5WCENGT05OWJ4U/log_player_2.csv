"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price before committing.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, and you could potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and I'm hoping it will encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my counteroffer to $1,025,000. This is a smaller step than before, and I'm hoping it will show Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but also that I'm willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice has come down to $1,030,000 which is a good price considering my initial limit of $1,200,000. There's a risk that she might not accept my next counteroffer and I'll end up buying from John. So, I'll accept her offer and secure the product."
