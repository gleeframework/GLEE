"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm hoping to pay a bit less. I'm happy to offer $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own needs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000? This would make it a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be ready to close the purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
