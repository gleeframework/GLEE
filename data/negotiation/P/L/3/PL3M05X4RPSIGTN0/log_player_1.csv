Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, there's no guarantee he'll go higher than $8,000. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer or no deal at all."
