Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting frustrated, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $13,250.

It's clear Alice is very firm on her price. While we might be able to shave off a little more, going into the final round is too risky. It's better to secure the known good deal with John at $10,000 than to risk Alice being unwilling to budge further and ending up with no deal at all."
