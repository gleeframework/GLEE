"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. You have the safety net of buying from John at $120 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. It's significantly below both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget, leaving room for compromise.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is framed in a way that is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating your price preference.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a highly favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $115 is still above your ideal price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Suggesting a price point directly in the middle of the previous offers ($100 and $115) is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  While still aiming for a lower price, this counteroffer keeps you below your alternative option of buying from John."
