"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the significant value this product holds for you based on my understanding of your needs. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.** This is less than your maximum budget of $150.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30** compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most rational choice in this scenario, as it guarantees you a lower price than John's and gets you the product within your budget."
