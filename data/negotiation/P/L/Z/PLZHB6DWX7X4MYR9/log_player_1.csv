Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $2,500 markup (25%) is significant but not outrageous. It allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Scarcity Tactic:**  Mentioning that I'll list it publicly if Bob declines adds a subtle sense of urgency and potential loss for him."
