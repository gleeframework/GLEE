{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above what Bob values the product at, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to potentially earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go any lower. To ensure I get my minimum price, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150."
