"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is below his maximum budget, it's still too high. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob has the option of buying from John. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me is quite high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his preferred price. There are still 7 rounds left. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,075,000 is the highest I can go right now.  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your original asking price and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is a significant discount on its true value, reflecting my desire to see this deal closed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is close to Bob's preferred price, and they've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Accepting this offer means Bob saves $10,000 compared to buying from John and it's a good deal considering Alice's initial asking price. There's always the risk of trying for a lower price, but the potential savings are minimal, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal to John."
