"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your perspective. While I recognize there's a gap between our valuations, I believe $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's inherent value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially go up to $1,050,000.  This offer stands as a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. This is a firm number, and I'm unable to go any lower. I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential and the value it brings. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
