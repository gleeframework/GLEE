Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer! $13,500 is still a bit low for me considering the value this product offers. How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $15,500 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $14,000?  That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage to get a lower price.  Since Bob is unwilling to budge past $14,000, it's better to take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
