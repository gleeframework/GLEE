"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and features, I'd like to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you valuing the product so highly.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $100 for it, given my budget limitations.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understanding your budget constraints. Considering the value I place on the product, I am willing to adjust my offer to $110. This still allows me to feel fairly compensated while remaining within your budget range. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $110, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price he is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $110 is closer to my budget, I'm still only comfortable spending $100.  This is a fair price for both of us considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell it.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to offer the product to you for $105. This price allows me to feel fairly compensated while staying within your budget constraints. I believe this to be a mutually beneficial solution. Please let me know if this revised offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $105, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Bob has been steadfast in his offer of $100, and Alice is unlikely to budge further. It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $100.  This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a deadlock."
