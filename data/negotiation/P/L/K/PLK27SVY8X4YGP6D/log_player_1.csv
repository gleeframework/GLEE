"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant value, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob likely doesn't know the true value of the product. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to concede. 
* **Confidence & Value:** My message emphasizes the value and uniqueness of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates a willingness to negotiate, setting the stage for a back-and-forth process. 

This is my initial offer, and I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Still High:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still $100,000 higher than my guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $800,000, rejecting Bob's offer keeps the door open for a potentially higher return. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $950,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.
