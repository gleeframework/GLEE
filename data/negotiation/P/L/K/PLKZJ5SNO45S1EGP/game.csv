"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $130, which is still a fair price given the value you mentioned. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $130, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $175. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $145. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a decent profit while I can get a great deal on this product. Let's make it happen.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to consider your offer of $145. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle again. How about we compromise at $160? It's still a good profit for me, and you'll get a great deal on the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
