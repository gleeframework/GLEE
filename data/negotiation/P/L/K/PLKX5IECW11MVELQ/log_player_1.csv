# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{

``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below John's offer.  It's worth risking another round to see if we can push Bob closer to $970,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We are making a small concession to signal some flexibility, but also drawing a line in the sand. This creates a sense of urgency and makes it clear to Bob that this is a serious offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $965,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving in the right direction but slowly. We're getting closer to a point where accepting his offer might be the right choice, but we still have some room to negotiate. A firm rejection now might push him closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $970,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round, after which I will be moving forward with another buyer."",
""product_price"": 970000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** By introducing a deadline, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Compromise:** Meeting halfway shows a willingness to compromise, but holding firm on the price reinforces the value of the product.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Reminding Bob of John's offer emphasizes that we have other options if he's unwilling to meet our price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome, pushing Bob to make his final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering our previous negotiations, I am willing to pay $967,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $967,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $967,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving significantly towards our price, and we're approaching the end of our negotiation window. He's made it clear he's unwilling to meet our $970,000 bottom line.  While we could continue pushing, we risk losing both Bob and John. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
