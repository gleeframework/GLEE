"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details publicly, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  However, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price significantly lower than that, recognizing your specific needs.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to gain a profitable sale.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
