,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,500? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
