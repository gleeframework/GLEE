Round 2
Bob's offer:

Explanation:  

While Bob is getting closer, we've reached a point where the negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome than John's standing offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him stalling or the negotiations falling apart, leaving us with a worse outcome."
