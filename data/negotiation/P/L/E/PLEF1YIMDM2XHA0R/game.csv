"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a serious offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1000000.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1300000. This is my best compromise, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I still think $1200000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a high-demand product, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about $1225000?  That's a fair compromise that's within both of our price ranges. Let's finalize this and get the product moving.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that we're really close to a deal. However, I still think $1225000 is a bit short of the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'll throw in an additional incentive: I'll include a premium support package worth $50000, which will give you an exclusive advantage in using the product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of the support package, but I'm still focused on finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, and we can discuss the support package separately if that price is agreeable.  I'm confident we can find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see that we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I want to make it more attractive for you. I'll throw in the premium support package worth $50000, and I'll also include a 5% discount on the total price. That brings the total value to $1235000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1235000.0,Alice,9,
