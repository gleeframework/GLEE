Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's still significantly less than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to him and suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John. 

**Note:**  This is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the evolving negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John right now would guarantee a higher price, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired amount.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price somewhere between his offer and my initial offer, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to both of us, emphasizing the potential for a win-win outcome.
* **Setting a clear next step:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to continuing the negotiation, but I'm not willing to go lower than this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,150,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can push him much higher.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:**  Bob has shown a strong desire to save money, and his counteroffers are decreasing.  It's unlikely he'll agree to a price that's significantly higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,500,000, which is far more appealing than the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to negotiate a higher price with Bob,  the risk associated with further negotiations outweighs the potential reward.  Selling to John is the most financially secure option at this point."
