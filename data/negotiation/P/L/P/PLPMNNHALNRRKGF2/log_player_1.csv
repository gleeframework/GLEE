Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob by continuing the negotiation. 

This decision demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my goal of maximizing profits."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain Value:** I'm remaining firm in my belief that the product is worth more than Bob's offer.

* **Keep Negotiations Open:**  The message emphasizes compromise, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation process.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  To make this work, I'm offering $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find common ground.
