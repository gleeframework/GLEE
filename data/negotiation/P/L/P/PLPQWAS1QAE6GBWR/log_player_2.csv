# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the exceptional benefits it offers to users like you. I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
