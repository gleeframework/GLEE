"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125, but I'll throw in a small bonus, which will make it a great deal for you. Let me think for a moment... Ah, yes! I'll throw in a 10% discount on the product. That would bring the price down to $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but no higher. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at your target price of $110, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal too. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110, but I'll throw in a small additional bonus, which will make it a great deal for both of us. Let me think for a moment... Ah, yes! I'll throw in a 5% discount on the product, which will bring the price down to $104.50. What do you think?",104.5,Alice,9,
