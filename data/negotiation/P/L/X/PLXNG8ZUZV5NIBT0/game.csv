"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to me, and I believe its value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from the product. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $825,000. This offer is a compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
