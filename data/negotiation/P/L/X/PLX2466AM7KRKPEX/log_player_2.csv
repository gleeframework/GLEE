"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, you open the door to potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $100 shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating. It also leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice has shown some flexibility by dropping her offer to $110, I'm raising my offer slightly to $105. This demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise but still believe the price is too high.  This also keeps the negotiation moving towards a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within my acceptable range of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting further offers and me ending up buying from John for $120 is too high. It's time to secure the deal at a good price."
