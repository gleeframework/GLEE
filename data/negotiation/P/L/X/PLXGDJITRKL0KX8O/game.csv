"Thanks for the offer Alice! It's a great product but unfortunately, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $9000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $10500 was my previous offer, but I'll go a bit lower to $10250. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much further I can go. I'll make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $10250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",10250.0,Alice,7,
