Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Sale:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications that could arise from waiting.

This offer balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of John's offer."
