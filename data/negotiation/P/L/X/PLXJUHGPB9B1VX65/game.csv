"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000, which is still a good margin above my minimum price. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
