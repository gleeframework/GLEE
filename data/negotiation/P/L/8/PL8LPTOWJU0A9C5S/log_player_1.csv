"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant amount for Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to negotiating, which could potentially lead to a deal that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to maximize my profits while staying within a reasonable range that Bob might find appealing.
* By starting high, I create some room for negotiation and potentially earn more. 
* I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it does show he's interested in the product. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.  

**Strategy:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and try to get a better price. 
* I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.
* I'm mindful of the deadline and the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to continue negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us.
* By showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* I'm still keeping in mind the option to sell to John, but I'm optimistic about reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on my offer of $12000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has made it clear that $12,000 is his absolute maximum, and he's not willing to budge.
* **My minimum:** I'm unwilling to accept a price below $15,000, as it's my minimum.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Given that Bob won't increase his offer, selling the product to John for $15,000 is the best option to maximize my profits. 

**Strategy:**

* It's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than risk further rounds of negotiations with Bob, which could lead to a dead end.
*  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it seems like he's not willing to compromise. 
* I need to prioritize maximizing my earnings, and selling to John is the most sensible choice in this situation."
