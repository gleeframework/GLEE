Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,025,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and gets me closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept it."
