"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $50?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $90. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $65?",65.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $65 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
