"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $78 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $81?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
