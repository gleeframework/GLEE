"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm prepared to let it go for a price that's mutually beneficial. Consider this my initial offer: $1,000,000. Let's discuss if this is a good starting point for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's opening suggests negotiation is possible:**  She emphasizes the product's value to both parties and uses phrases like ""mutually beneficial"" and ""good starting point."" This implies she might be willing to lower the price.
* **You have a backup option:**  John guarantees you the product at $1,000,000. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This opens the door for a counter-offer from her, potentially saving you money. You can always fall back on John's offer if Alice doesn't budge."
