"That's a bit too high for me, I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. Is that something you'd be more comfortable with?",16000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $14000, which is closer to my minimum price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $13500, which is my best and final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your best and final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Is this the last chance to meet in the middle?",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on selling to you and consider other options. I'm going to sell the product to someone else.,0.0,Alice,9,
