Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or a surprisingly quick acceptance. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal (saving $25) while still netting you a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Encouraging Message:**  The message aims to be positive and frame the price as a special opportunity. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further or outright reject the offer. You'll have to decide how to respond based on his reaction."
