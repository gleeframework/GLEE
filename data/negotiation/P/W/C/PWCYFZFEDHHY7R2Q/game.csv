"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $15,000 to someone like you, and to get the ball rolling, I'm happy to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  While $10,500 is closer to the value I'm looking for, I can't quite let it go for that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,
