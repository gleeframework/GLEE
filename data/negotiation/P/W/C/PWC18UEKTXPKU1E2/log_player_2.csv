"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $120 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is a good deal, but you know you can get the product for $120 from John. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer."
