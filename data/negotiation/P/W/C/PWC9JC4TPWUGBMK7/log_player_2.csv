"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, considering my budget and its potential value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for some potential compromise. It also provides a reason for the offer based on your budget and perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is already a fairly aggressive discount on my end. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,000 is still above my budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,250, as it's a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims for a middle ground between the two previous offers. By proposing $11,250, it demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining within a reasonable price range for Bob. This approach can increase the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer."
