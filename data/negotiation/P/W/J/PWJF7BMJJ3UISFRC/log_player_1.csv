Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John. Therefore, her goal is to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant gain over John's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale."
