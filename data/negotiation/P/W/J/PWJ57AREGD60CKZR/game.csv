"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, though. Would you be willing to consider $12000? That's my top offer, but I'm sure we can find a good deal.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16000. It's a great price, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $14000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $15500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want this product, and $15500 is a fair offer. However, I'm still a bit over my budget. Would you be willing to accept $15000 as a final offer? I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",15000.0,Bob,6,
