Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This price reflects its value to me while also being a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
