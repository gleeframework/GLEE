# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.

Alice's offer is now at $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to pay closer to my initial counteroffer of $950,000, $1,000,000 is a reasonable price.  I'm happy to accept this offer as it saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for both of us."
