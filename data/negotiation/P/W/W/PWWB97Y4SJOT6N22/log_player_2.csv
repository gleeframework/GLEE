It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You want to save as much money as possible, and $15,000 is above your limit. You'll counteroffer to try and get a lower price."

Alice is still above your budget.  Since you can get the product from John for $12,000, it's better to go with that option and save the extra $1,000."
