Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than selling to John, there's still room to negotiate for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price. It's better than selling to John, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower price or a stalemate."
