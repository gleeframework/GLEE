"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still above the product's value to Alice, meaning there's room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  By rejecting the offer, you can try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure this product for a slightly lower price.  Considering the value it holds for you, I believe $850,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget while still providing you with a profitable sale."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to consider a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while meeting your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and her offer is $875,000. 
* **You've already made a counteroffer.** It's likely that continued negotiation will only lead to a longer process and potentially a higher price, given Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John."
