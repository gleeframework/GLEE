"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than $10,000,  Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob! I can see that you're serious about the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still too high for Bob. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge further."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $9,000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $9,750. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $9,750, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  It's getting close to Bob's maximum budget ($10,000), and it seems like the negotiation is going to be a long process.  It's  better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John at a slightly higher price than continue negotiating with Alice."
