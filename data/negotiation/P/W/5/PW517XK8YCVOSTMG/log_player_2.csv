"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John's offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is way above my budget for this product.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This creates room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal. 
* **Not Too Low:** While low, $6,000 isn't an insulting offer. It shows I'm serious about buying but need a price that works for me. 
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite but clearly states my position and desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $9,000 is still higher than my alternative of buying from John for $8,000. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to move on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000).  
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's crucial to keep my offers below $8,000. This ensures that if Alice rejects and I need to go with John, I'm still getting a better deal.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate while firmly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $8,200, which is still more expensive than John's $8,000 offer. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and further negotiation may not be productive. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best price available."
