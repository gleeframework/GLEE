"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. Unfortunately, $12,000 is way above my budget for this product.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being willing to move on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
