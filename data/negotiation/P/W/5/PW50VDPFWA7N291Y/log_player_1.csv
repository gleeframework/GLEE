{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will get. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not immediately cutting off negotiation by refusing counteroffers, giving Bob the chance to come closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a strong fallback position in case negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000, and even lower than my starting offer. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is clearly interested and has indicated a willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not pressured to accept a bad deal.

**Next step:** I'll counteroffer Bob and try to find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go as low as $8,500, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation positive. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not yet making a final stand, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $8,750 is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  While it's closer, it's not yet a good enough deal for me.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing genuine interest and willingness to negotiate, so there's still room for improvement. 
* **John is the safety net:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer allows me to hold out for a better price without feeling pressured. 

**Next step:** I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm ready to make one last concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my desired range.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making one more concession, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to close the deal.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** Again, I frame the offer as a fair compromise, hoping to leverage Bob's desire for a reasonable deal.
* **Clear Closing Point:** I explicitly mention this as my ""last concession,"" putting a bit more pressure on Bob to consider accepting. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:**  While I'm hoping for a yes, I'm prepared to accept John's offer if Bob still declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,750, so I'll offer $9,125. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** $9,125 is close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired outcome. I've already made several concessions, and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **John is the better option:**  Since John is guaranteed to pay $10,000, selling to him represents a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal than I can get with John.

**Conclusion:** While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob, I'm happy to secure the higher price from John."
