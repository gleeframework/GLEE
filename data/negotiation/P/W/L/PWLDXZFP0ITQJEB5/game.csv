"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to purchase the product from you for $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,5,
