"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
