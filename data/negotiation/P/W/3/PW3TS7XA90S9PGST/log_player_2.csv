{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. I'm not going to accept that. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $75, which is still below my maximum price but closer to what I think is fair."

While $85 is closer to my target, I still think I can get it for less.  I'll counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $80. This should be a good deal for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $82.5, which is only $2.50 more than my maximum. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk she'll get stubborn or I'll run out of rounds. It's better to accept her offer and get the product."
