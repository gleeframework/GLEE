Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its significant value, especially to someone like you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting negotiations closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value, especially tailored to Bob's needs, can make the offer more appealing and justify the high price. 

**Important:**

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By starting high, we aim for the best-case scenario while having the safety net of John's offer."
