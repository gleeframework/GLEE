"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I can't go any higher than that.",135.0,Bob,4,
