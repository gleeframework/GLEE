"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see the value of the product is clear to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Let's try $795,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers.",795000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $810,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers.",810000.0,Alice,7,
