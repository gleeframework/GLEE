"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. This price is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's worth to me and willing to take the risk of rejection in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm not giving up too much yet. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in this product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still keeping it above Bob's offer.  It's getting closer to John's offer, but I'm not giving up just yet.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk losing out completely to Bob's lowball offers.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
