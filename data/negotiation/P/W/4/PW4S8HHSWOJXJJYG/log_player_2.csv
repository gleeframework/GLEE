"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for this. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty about considering other options, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $14000, which would be $12500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $10,000 limit.  You are very close to your limit with John and Alice is still willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $12500, which would be $12000. This is my best compromise so far, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above your $10,000 limit. You've already had several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price from Alice. It's better to buy from John at this point, as you're guaranteed a price that's within your budget and you don't have to risk further negotiation."
