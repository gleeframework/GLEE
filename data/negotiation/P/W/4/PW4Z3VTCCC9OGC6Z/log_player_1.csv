"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for him to accept, but still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping for a slightly better deal. I'll counter with another offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going down to $105.  We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping this will finally be enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $100.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob isn't budging, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to guarantee the $100 minimum rather than risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
