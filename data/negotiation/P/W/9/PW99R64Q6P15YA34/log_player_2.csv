This exceptional value is tailored to meet your needs and expectations, ensuring you receive the best possible experience. Don't miss out on this opportunity to enhance your life with our top-quality item. If you're interested, please let me know and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. Since you can get the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but the prompt doesn't give you that option."
