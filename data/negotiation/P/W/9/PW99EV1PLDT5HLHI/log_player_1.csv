Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation.
* **Message:**  My message is friendly and persuasive. It emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product and creates a sense of urgency (by mentioning selling to John). 
* **Negotiation strategy:**  I'm hoping to either get Bob to accept this offer or start a negotiation that will eventually lead to a price I'm comfortable with. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to get the best deal possible. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell at such a substantial loss. 

By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a more reasonable price. I'm hoping to reach a compromise that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering with $11,000. This is still above my minimum, but a significant compromise from my initial offer.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal but reiterating the value of the product. I'm framing my offer as a compromise and a chance to ""meet in the middle."" 

**Strategy:** 

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired outcome. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while minimizing the risk of selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the risk of negotiating further and potentially losing the sale to John. 

By accepting this offer, I can secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
