"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is my final offer.  This still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can finalize this deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8875.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let's close this deal!",8875.0,Alice,5,
