"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is my final offer.  This still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still slightly above his maximum.  He can potentially save another $1,000 by continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to push her down further to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8875.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $8,875, which is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might raise her price again in the next round or refuse to budge further.

Considering Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's more advantageous to secure the lower price and avoid the potential for further negotiation complications."
