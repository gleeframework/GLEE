"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my final offer.  This still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can finalize this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try to counteroffer once more to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,875.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8875}
