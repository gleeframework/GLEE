"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $15,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a middle ground, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $17,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $16,000. If you're not willing to accept that, we might have to walk away.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $16,250.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,500 and $16,250. I'm thinking of a price of $16,375. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16375.0,Alice,9,
