"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $15,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a middle ground, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob is still aiming for a lower price. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $17,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $17,000 is closer to his desired price, he's still better off rejecting and counter-offering again.  He has 5 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $17,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm going to stick to my offer of $16,000. If you're not willing to accept that, we might have to walk away.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He has 3 rounds left.  While $16,500 is getting close, he's still better off rejecting and counter-offering again. There's a chance Alice will accept, or if not, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $16,250.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 16250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,500 and $16,250. I'm thinking of a price of $16,375. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has only one round left. Even if he rejects Alice's offer and makes a counteroffer, there is no guarantee that Alice will accept it. It's getting very close to his maximum price, and with only one round remaining, it's more advantageous to buy from John for his desired price of $15,000."
