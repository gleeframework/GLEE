Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as he values the product at $100 and can get it for $40 less. At the same time, I get $10 less than what I could get from John, but I'm still making a good profit.  This strategy maximizes my chances of a quick sale while still getting a decent price."
