"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, and I'm trying to stay within my budget.  $10,500 is my absolute best offer. If you can't do that, I'll have to consider my other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me to justify the sale. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12250.0,Alice,7,
