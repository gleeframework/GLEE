Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to see how Bob reacts.

{""product_price"": $850,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum value I have for the product, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum value.

{""product_price"": $795,000}"
