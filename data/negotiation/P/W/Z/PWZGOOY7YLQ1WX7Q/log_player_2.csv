"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit below your target, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000, but I can also consider a compromise. How about $950000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $950,000 is still within your budget.  It's a good deal compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee you can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, so it's a good time to accept."
