"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
