"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($1,200,000) than Bob's ($1,000,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and more likely to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting that my price is fair. 
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm leaving some space for negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer. 

This approach aims to get the ball rolling while ensuring I don't start too low and potentially miss out on maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is far too low, his message indicates he's willing to negotiate and values the product. This gives me room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Strategic play:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates my commitment to getting a fair price and sets the stage for further negotiations.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I'm trying to maximize my profit. If I can push Bob closer to my target price, it's worth exploring.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and continue the negotiation process."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $1,050,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a significant benefit. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget but emphasizing the product's worth. My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial price, demonstrating flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition, subtly pressuring him to consider the benefits of paying a slightly higher price.
* **Setting a Limit:** By stating that $1,050,000 is my ""absolute lowest,"" I create a sense of urgency and a clear boundary for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, emphasizing collaboration rather than confrontation.

This counteroffer is a strategic move, balancing my need to make a profit with the potential to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to maximizing profit and creating the potential for a higher counteroffer.
* **Strategic play:** Rejecting the offer allows me to push Bob further towards my target price, and I still have options if he continues to resist. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. 

I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for a deal that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground and close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (sort of):**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm suggesting that this is a final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal. By showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation leverage:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer is simply not in my best interest. 
* **Strategic play:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to raise his offer further. 
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John is always an option, I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob.

This decision maintains my negotiating position, demonstrating my commitment to earning a profit closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $950,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a product that's worth a lot more to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is my final attempt to bridge the gap with Bob. It's a significant compromise from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This is a classic negotiation tactic to show a willingness to compromise and encourage acceptance.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Creating Urgency:**  I'm making this a ""last chance"" offer to put pressure on Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to accept and finalize the sale while remaining close to my minimum acceptable price. It's a high-stakes move, but with only a few rounds left, it's worth pushing for a favorable outcome."
