"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $1,050,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a significant benefit. Let's make this deal happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still below what this product is worth. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground and close this deal!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $950,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time. How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a product that's worth a lot more to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,7,
