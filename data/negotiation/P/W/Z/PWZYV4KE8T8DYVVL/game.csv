"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to your target, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10800. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go up to $10800. I've already been thinking about buying the product from John for $8000, and I'm not sure if it's worth going above that. I'll make one final offer: $9500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Please let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",9500.0,Bob,6,
