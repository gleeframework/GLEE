"I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can do $10,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,250, and that's as low as I can go.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can do $10,000, but I need to get at least $10,500 out of this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go.",10000.0,Alice,7,
