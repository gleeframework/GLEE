"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1000000. This is an excellent value, considering the product's worth to you is $1200000. I'm offering you a 16.7% discount, which is a one-time opportunity you won't find anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay for the product. While you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This is a $200,000 saving, making it a good deal and worth accepting."
