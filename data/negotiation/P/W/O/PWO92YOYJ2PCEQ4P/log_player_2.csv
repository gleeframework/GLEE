"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do much better than $1,400,000.  He should counteroffer and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,250,000. This offer is good for the next 24 hours, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still do better. He should counteroffer again and see if he can get closer to his goal of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit short of what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's very close to his target price of $1,000,000, and there's still room to negotiate. If Alice is truly serious about selling, she will likely accept a counteroffer closer to his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I'm firm on my price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm prepared to move on to other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $1,200,000, and while that's better than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely he can get Alice to come down to his target price.  Buying from John guarantees him the best price and allows him to move on to other things."
