Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.  This strategy allows for potential counter-offers while keeping the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I'm still not satisfied. I can likely get closer to my target value by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has now offered his final price, which is still below my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a higher price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further time wasted in negotiations."
