"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting high, at $150, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  I'm also aiming for a price that's more than my minimum desired amount, giving me some leeway to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired amount. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm reducing my price to $110, still above my minimum desired amount. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product. This leaves room for further negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $100. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to reach a deal before I run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum desired amount, and I'm worried that if I reject it, I might end up with a lower price or have to sell to John for $120. It's better to secure a deal now than risk a worse outcome."
