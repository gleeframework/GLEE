"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth seeing if you can get a better price.  Since you're willing to pay $150, you have room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price gives you room to negotiate. This also shows Alice you are serious about getting a deal but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer.  $137.50 is still within your budget and a good compromise. It's likely that you can't get a much better price, especially with John offering the same price."
