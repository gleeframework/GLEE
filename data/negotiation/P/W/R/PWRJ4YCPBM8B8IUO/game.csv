"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to move forward with the sale at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000, but I still think that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
