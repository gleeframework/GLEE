Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
