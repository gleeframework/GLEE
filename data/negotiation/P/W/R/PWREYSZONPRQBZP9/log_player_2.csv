Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant discount, hoping to show Alice I'm serious about getting a good price.  $9,000 is still a good deal for her, and it gives us room to negotiate further if needed."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm offering a price that's almost halfway between her last offer and my last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want to keep the price as low as possible.  Let's see if she'll accept this offer."

I'm getting closer to my goal, but I'm still trying to keep the price below $10,000.  This offer is a small increase from my last one, but I think it's a good compromise.  I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
