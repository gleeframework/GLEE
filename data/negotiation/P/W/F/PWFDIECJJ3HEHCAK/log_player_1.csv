Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident that its true value is much higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm thinking of a price around $950,000. Can we discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear the negotiations are going to be a slow grind to get him close to $1,000,000.  Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's more time-efficient and less risky to accept the sure thing.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but it's not worth the risk of him walking away or the time investment at this point."
