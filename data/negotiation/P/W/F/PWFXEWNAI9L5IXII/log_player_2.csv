"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. It's a great value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to drop the price further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9,500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to stay under $9,000 if possible. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is closer to my target of $9,000.  It's a good deal considering John's price of $10,000, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away."
