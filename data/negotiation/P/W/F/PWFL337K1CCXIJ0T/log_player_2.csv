"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget constraints, $11,000 is significantly less than what I can accept for this product. Could you consider something closer to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I can tell you're serious about this product. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stuck at her minimum price ($15,000) and has even labeled it her ""final offer."" It's unlikely she'll go lower.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice when you can save $5,000 by going with John."
