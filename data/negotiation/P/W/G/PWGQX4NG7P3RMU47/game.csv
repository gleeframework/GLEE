I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105?,105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not getting any younger, Bob! I'll give you one last chance to make a deal. I'll meet you at $105 again, but this is my final offer on that price. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Alice,9,
