"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price. Although it's closer than before, it's still not a deal I'm willing to take right now. I want to see if I can get the price down even further. I'll counteroffer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price of $1,000,000. While we're getting closer, I don't want to risk going over my budget. I've already rejected multiple offers and I have limited rounds left.  Given the opportunity to buy the product from John for my maximum price, I'll take that option and finalize the deal."
