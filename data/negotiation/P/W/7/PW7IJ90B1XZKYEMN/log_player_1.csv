Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The offer isn't so high that Bob will immediately reject it, encouraging him to make a counteroffer.
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is above my minimum of $15,000, allowing me to potentially earn more.

**Next steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. If he seems unwilling to meet my price, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $11,500 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a lower price from Bob. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to close the gap without giving up too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is the best I can offer at this point. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This price is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $15,000,  giving me some room to potentially increase the price in future rounds. 
* **Demonstrating flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but still firm in my value for the product.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, there's a risk he'll refuse and I'll be left with nothing.
* **Guaranteed offer:** John's offer of $15,000 is a sure thing, ensuring I get the minimum price I'm comfortable with.

**Next steps:**

I'll move on to John and close the deal, securing a guaranteed profit. It's not the highest price, but it's the most secure option given Bob's continued reluctance to meet my price."
