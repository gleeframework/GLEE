"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $150 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, you can get the product for a much better price ($80) from John.  You should go with the guaranteed lower price."
