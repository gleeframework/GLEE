Alice's offer:

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll counteroffer at $120. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very firm on her price and it's unlikely she'll go below $120.  You can get the product for sure from John at $100, saving you at least $20."
