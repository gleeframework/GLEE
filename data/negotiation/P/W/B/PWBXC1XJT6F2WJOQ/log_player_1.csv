Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to sell for that price right now. I want to explore if we can find a more agreeable price point.  I believe the product's value justifies a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.

I'm confident this offer is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $925,000 is a better offer than before, it's still not meeting my minimum price expectations. I'm willing to continue negotiating but I'm not going to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $935,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $935,000 is getting closer, I'm getting the feeling that Bob might not be willing to meet my minimum price. I've already made several concessions and I'm not sure further negotiations will be productive. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to secure the deal."
