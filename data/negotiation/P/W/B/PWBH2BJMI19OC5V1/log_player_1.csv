Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000? I think this price is more in line with my expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $1,300,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
