"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate down while still maximizing my profit.  I'm also being friendly to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's too early to give up on getting a better deal.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's try to find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price.  I'm also emphasizing the need to find a solution that works for both of us to build a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'd be willing to go up to $70, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to counteroffer again and see if we can close the deal at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $70 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and emphasize the fairness of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying my best to make this work, Alice.  Could you do $75?  That would be pushing my budget, but I think it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had five rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with his offer.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John. I'm going to sell the product to John."
