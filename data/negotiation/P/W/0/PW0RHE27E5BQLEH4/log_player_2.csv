"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $16,000. This is slightly above the base value but includes exclusive features and benefits designed just for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $16,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially get a better price. 
* While buying from John is an option, it's important to explore if a better deal can be negotiated with Alice."
