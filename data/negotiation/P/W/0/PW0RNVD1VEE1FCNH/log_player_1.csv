{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's something you'll truly value.  My initial price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential for you.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While $900,000 is a significant profit,  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range with further negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and is fair considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,075,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me.  While I'd like to push for a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether, especially with only six rounds left."
