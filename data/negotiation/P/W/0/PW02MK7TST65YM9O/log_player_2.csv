"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potentially better price. Bob has the option of buying from John at $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept a price he's not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,325,000.  While this is still above Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal, especially since John is a backup option.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within Bob's budget, saving time and potentially avoiding any further negotiations."
