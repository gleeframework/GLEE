"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about we try $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
