Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm not ready to commit to that price yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
