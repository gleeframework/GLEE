"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what you value it at, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm not ready to commit to that price yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
