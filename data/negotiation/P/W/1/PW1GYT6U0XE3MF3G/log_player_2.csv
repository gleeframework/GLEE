"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $50,000."
