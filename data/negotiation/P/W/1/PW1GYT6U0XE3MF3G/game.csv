"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $900,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $850,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
