You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within the range where further negotiation might be possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get a better deal, so he's offering $850,000, a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a good compromise and within Bob's acceptable range. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on a good deal increases. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
