"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I'm getting a fair value for my product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $13,500.
