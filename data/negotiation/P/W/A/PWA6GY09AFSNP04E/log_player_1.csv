Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary without dropping below my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am proposing to purchase the product for $13,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a better price.  Bob is clearly interested and has already shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to close the gap. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong negotiating position and allows me to hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I'm getting a fair value for my product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Framing the Price as Fair:** I'm highlighting the fairness of the price for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still above Bob's initial offer, indicating that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **John's Offer in the Back of My Mind:**  Knowing John's offer provides me with a backup plan, giving me the confidence to hold firm on my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $13,500. I would like to propose purchasing the product for $13,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiation might risk a stalemate, especially since Bob has already rejected my previous counteroffer.
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation could lead to a delay in selling the product, costing me valuable time.  
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I have a solid fallback option with John's offer if I need to walk away. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and minimize the risk of losing a deal altogether."
