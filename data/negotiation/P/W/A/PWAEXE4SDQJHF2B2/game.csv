"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you do $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
