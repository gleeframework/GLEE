"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $15,000.  It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
