"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $15,000.  It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Emphasize Effort:** Acknowledging Bob's compromise helps keep the negotiation positive.
* **""Split the Difference"":**  This phrase suggests a fair solution and can make it easier for Bob to agree.
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide."
