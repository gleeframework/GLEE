Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $15,000.  It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer is still above your budget. Even though it's getting closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with her. Buying from John at $12,000 is the safest and most budget-friendly option."
