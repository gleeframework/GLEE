"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a substantial saving. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a better price from Alice. There's still room for negotiation, and you can use the option of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $1,080,000? This would still be a significant savings for you, while allowing me to get closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still closer to your goal of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, trying to push her closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there. How about $1,060,000? This is a good compromise and gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,070,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is very close to your target. You're only $70,000 away from your goal. It's likely that you won't get a better deal from Alice, and you risk losing the deal altogether if you keep rejecting offers.  The risk of negotiating further is higher than the potential savings."
