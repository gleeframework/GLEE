"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. The product is worth $80 to you, so you have room to bargain."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

While $100 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum.  You can try to negotiate further."
