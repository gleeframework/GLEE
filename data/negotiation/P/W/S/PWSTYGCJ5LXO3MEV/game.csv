"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a number I can be comfortable with. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $975,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire.  I'm willing to go as high as $990,000, but that's my absolute limit.",990000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'm counteroffering at $995,000.",995000.0,Alice,7,
