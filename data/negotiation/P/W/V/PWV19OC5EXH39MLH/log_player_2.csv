While $17,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm going to counteroffer again."

I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000.  It's a better deal for me, even though I might not get the same product."
