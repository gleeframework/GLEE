{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still a good deal, but I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I will try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to accept $12,000.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $13500. I would like to propose a price of $12500. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $10,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
