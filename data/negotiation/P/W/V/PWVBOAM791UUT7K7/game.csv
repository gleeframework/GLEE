"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product, which is $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $900,000, as that's already a compromise for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll offer you $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
