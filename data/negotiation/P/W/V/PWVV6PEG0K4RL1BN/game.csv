"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,500,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also confident in the significant value this product brings. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,750,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges its worth while still working for you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value in your product, I must stick to my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $1,700,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $1,700,000. I think $1,600,000 might be a more feasible price for me. I hope this can work for both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
