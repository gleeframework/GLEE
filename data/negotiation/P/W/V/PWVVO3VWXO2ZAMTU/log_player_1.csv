Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my minimum price of $150, which allows room for Bob to counteroffer. This makes the negotiation feel more balanced. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm using an enthusiastic tone to make the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product to Bob by mentioning its usefulness.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a deal. I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial proposal.  I also have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum price of $150. Even though it's closer to his valuation, it's not a financially viable deal for me.
* **Opportunity to counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $150 gives me leverage and confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and increase my chances of getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $120?  It's a fair price for a fantastic product, and it's a good compromise between our offers."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm offering $120, which is halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and compromise. 
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by calling it ""fantastic.""
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm positioning my offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal that is beneficial for both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $110 is very close to my minimum price of $150, but it's still below it. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Accepting Bob's offer might lead to more rounds of negotiation, potentially resulting in an even lower price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable amount.

By selling to John, I avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob and secure a guaranteed profit.  The risk of getting a lower price from Bob isn't worth it when I have a reliable buyer like John."
