"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $8,000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,200. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for closer to $6,500.  I understand the product is worth $8,000 to you, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $6,900. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $6,900 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay.  How about $6,700?  It's closer to your offer, and I think it would be a fair price for both of us.",6700.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,700. Considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a new offer of $6,850. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",6850.0,Alice,5,
