Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, starting high gives us negotiation room. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility (""discuss further"") to encourage Bob to counter-offer if the initial price is too high.
* **Justification of value:**  The message vaguely emphasizes the product's value (""significant value,"" ""your insights""), aiming to nudge Bob closer to our valuation. 

**Goal:** The goal is to find a sweet spot between Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) and our fallback price ($1,500,000).  By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, we maximize our potential profit."
