This offer is a starting point. It's  a high price but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob while still ensuring you're getting close to your goal of $1,500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
