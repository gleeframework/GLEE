"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal, but you can do better.
* You have the option to buy from John for $120, which is your maximum price. 
* Since you can get the product for your maximum price from John, there's no need to settle for Alice's offer. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options before resorting to buying from John."
