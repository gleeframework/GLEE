Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below your minimum price of $120. This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:**  This increases the likelihood that Bob will accept, as he still gets a good deal.
* **Lower than your minimum:** This secures you a higher price than selling to John, maximizing your potential earnings.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently move on to selling to John for your minimum price of $120."
