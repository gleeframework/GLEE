"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob.** Even though Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice is selling it for $900,000. This means Bob can save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not beneficial.** If Bob rejects, he has to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is the full amount he values it at.
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** This results in no savings for Bob.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice for Bob."
