Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
