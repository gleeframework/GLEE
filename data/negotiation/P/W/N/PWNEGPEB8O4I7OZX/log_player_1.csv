Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Justification for Value:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to consider the potential benefits and justify the higher price in his mind.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message keeps the conversation open, suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further. This allows Bob to feel involved in the process and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some leverage and that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product. If you have reason to believe Bob is a very tough negotiator or is highly price-sensitive, you might want to adjust your starting price accordingly."
