Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
