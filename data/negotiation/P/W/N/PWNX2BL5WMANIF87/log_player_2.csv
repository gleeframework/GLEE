"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price of $120.  There's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if you can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying, but it also demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.  $90 is a significant reduction from Alice's original offer, while still being within my price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and still gives you a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $95 is still above my target. I'm still confident I can get a better price if I keep negotiating.  It's also worth remembering that I have John as a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept anything above my max."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay around $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? "", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my goal of staying under $95, but I'm also demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.  Offering $92.50 shows that I'm serious about buying, while still giving Alice a little room to negotiate."
