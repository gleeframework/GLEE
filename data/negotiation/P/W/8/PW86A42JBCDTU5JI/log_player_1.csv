Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while giving you a significant return. Let's see if we can find common ground.

However, given the costs and investments made into the product, we cannot agree to the proposed price. We would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. This price still allows us a reasonable return on investment while acknowledging the value you place on the product. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would allow you to make a decent profit, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.
