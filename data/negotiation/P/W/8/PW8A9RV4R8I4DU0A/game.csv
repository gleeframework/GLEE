"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll see its worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,000 for it to make sense for me. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this offer balances its worth with your desire for a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too far off for me. To be honest, anything above $10,000 just doesn't make financial sense on my end. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm still interested.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a win-win for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. That middle ground is closer, but I need to stay firm on my budget. If you're willing to consider $10,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
