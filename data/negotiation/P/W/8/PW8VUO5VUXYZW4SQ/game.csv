"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's current market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but gives you a better deal than my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1300000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering both our positions. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1150000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a significant compromise on my end. If you're serious about buying this product, this is the best price I can offer. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
