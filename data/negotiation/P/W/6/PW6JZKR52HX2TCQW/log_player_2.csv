"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her value of $80. This signals my serious interest in buying the product while also demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my acceptable range of $150. It's a good deal compared to John's price, and I'm confident I won't be able to get a lower price from Alice."
