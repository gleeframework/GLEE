"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $825,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. Can you consider that price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's close this deal, I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
