"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a slightly better price.  How about $1350000? I believe that's still a fair price, considering the value to me, and allows for a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth the initial offer I made. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1380000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit.
