"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John guarantees a significantly higher profit.  It's worth exploring a few more rounds with Bob to see if a better offer can be reached, but selling to John is the safer option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to a reasonable price, it's still below the $1,350,000 I need to make this deal worthwhile.  It's risky, but I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little further. If this round doesn't yield a better result, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your final offer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you can see the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at my target price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1280000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below the $1,300,000 mark I'm aiming for, and with only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement is too high.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, selling to John guarantees a significantly higher profit and minimizes the risk of losing a potentially lucrative deal."
