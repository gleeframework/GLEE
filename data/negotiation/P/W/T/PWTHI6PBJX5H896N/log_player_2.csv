Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to get closer to it. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair compromise, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
