"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $875,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.",875000.0,Bob,6,
