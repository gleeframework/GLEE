{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $8,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still below my minimum but gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm mentioning the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard price, giving Bob the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm keeping John in the back of my mind as a backup buyer, but I'm giving Bob a chance to buy first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired price range before resorting to selling to John.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a good compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in this price, or if you need to reconsider further."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The price is still above my minimum of $12,000, allowing me to profit. 
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm restating my willingness to negotiate but also leaving room for Bob to back out if it's not within his budget.
* **Prepared for Rejection:** I'm ready for Bob to potentially reject this counteroffer, but I'm hoping the compromise will entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer is only $250 higher than his previous offer, indicating he's not willing to budge much.
* **Close to Minimum:** The offer is still very close to my minimum. 
* **John is the Safer Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is significantly better than the $8,750 offer from Bob.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a chance that if I reject Bob's offer, he'll get even more stubborn, potentially leading to further back and forth that could ultimately result in a lower price than John's offer.

I'm confident that John is the best option for maximizing my profits at this point."
