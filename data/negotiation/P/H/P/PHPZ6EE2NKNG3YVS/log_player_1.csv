Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to sell to Bob first gives me a chance to earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product for $11,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still being an attractive offer for Bob, as it's considerably less than his perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to my desired outcome."
