I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my guaranteed minimum value of $1,000,000 from John. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher potential profit:**  A higher price means a larger profit for me. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but finds the price too high. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a significantly higher sale."
