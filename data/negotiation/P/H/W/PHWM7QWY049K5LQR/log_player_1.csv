{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is close to my minimum value of $150, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $130. If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for such a fantastic product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low for me.  I'm not willing to go that low, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with him.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
