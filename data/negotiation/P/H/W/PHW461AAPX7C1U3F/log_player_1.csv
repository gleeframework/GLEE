``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a good starting point to see how interested he truly is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and shows flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still a good price for me and hopefully enough to convince Bob to accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough. I'm confident that John will buy it for $1,500,000, which is a good deal for me. I'm going to sell the product to John."
