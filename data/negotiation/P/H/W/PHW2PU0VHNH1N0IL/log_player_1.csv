Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $800,000, Bob values it much higher at $1,200,000. This presents a chance for a significantly higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely he'll go below $800,000 knowing it's his only chance to buy.
* **Confident Positioning:**  The message uses language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique chance"" to emphasize the product's value and create a sense of urgency. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the guaranteed sale to John as a backup."
