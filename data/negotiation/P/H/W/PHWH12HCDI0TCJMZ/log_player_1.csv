Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue the product from the start. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
