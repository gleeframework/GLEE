"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference again and settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure if $950,000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, but also reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still very interested in the product.  To be honest, my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'll buy it right now. Otherwise, I think I'll have to go with another option.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'd like to make it a bit sweeter for you. I'll throw in some additional perks and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. If you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, I'll include a comprehensive support package that will save you time and money in the long run. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
