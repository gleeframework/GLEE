"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, given its worth to you is $800,000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who's already committed to the full $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
