{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal while still being fair to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than the value to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. This is a good starting point to explore potential compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a good profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than your last counteroffer, and it's still above your minimum threshold of $10,000. Accepting his offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John for a lower price."
