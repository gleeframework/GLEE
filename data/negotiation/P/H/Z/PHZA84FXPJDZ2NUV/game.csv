"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  That way we both get a fair deal, and I can still make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this?",12500.0,Bob,4,
