{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still cannot go above $15,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a little closer to what I'd like to get, and it's only $500 less than my previous counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and ensure the sale."
