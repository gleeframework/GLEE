Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so $14,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer is still above your minimum of $15,000, giving you wiggle room to negotiate if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too high or too low, making it easier for Bob to accept or counter. 

By starting with a higher offer, you can potentially get closer to your desired price. Remember, you can always lower the price if Bob counters, but you can't raise it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $13,500. It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below your minimum of $15,000. You're better off rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer to try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $13,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's closer to your desired price:** It's a $500 increase from Bob's offer, bringing you closer to your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's still attractive to Bob:**  $14,500 is still within Bob's range of value, making it likely he'll consider it. 

By offering a compromise, you show flexibility while also pushing for a better price for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is still below your desired minimum of $15,000, it's a reasonable compromise. You've already rejected Bob's previous offer and made a counteroffer. It's possible that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth and potentially a longer negotiation process. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale quickly and within a reasonable price range."
