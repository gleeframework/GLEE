"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000.  This price reflects a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You have a good fallback option with John, so you have room to bargain."

Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and I believe we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my ideal price range. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially as I have a guaranteed option with John.  I'll try to get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
