"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $8,200. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Alice,5,
