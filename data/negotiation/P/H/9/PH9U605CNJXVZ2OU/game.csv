"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit. This price reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
