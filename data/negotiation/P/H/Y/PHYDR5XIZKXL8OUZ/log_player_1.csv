Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before anyone else.  I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to let it go for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start high to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price while still aiming for a price significantly higher than $10,000.
* **""First refusal"" approach:** By phrasing the offer as a priority opportunity for Bob, it might make him perceive the product as more desirable. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your desired approach (aggressive, moderate, etc.) and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the initial offer and messaging."
