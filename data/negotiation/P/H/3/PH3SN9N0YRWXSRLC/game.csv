"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
