# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500, and you have a guaranteed offer for $12,000 from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get a better deal elsewhere."
