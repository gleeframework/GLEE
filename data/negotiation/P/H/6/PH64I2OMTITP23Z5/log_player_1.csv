"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is more than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $115. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $112.  This is a compromise, but it's still more than my minimum and I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $108 is more than what John is offering, it's still not as close to my ideal price as I'd like. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $110.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. We're getting close to the midpoint of our desired prices, and I believe this is a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  I've reached a point where Bob is not willing to meet my price, and while $106 is more than John's offer, I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
