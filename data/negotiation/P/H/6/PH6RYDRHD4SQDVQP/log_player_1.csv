"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. It's a bit more in my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more favorable deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still represents a great value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to rush into selling to John unless I'm truly stuck."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to accept $9,000, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet, especially since John is willing to pay $15,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go any lower than $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer - if you're serious about buying it, let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
