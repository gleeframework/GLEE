"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $108.75?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal here.",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $108.00, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
