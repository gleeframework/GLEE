Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me some leverage in this negotiation.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial value assessment, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that undervalues the product. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a margin that reflects the product's value to me. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also pushing Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a clear exit strategy if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result. I'll see if I can get Bob to raise his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1120000} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but staying below my ideal price point.  I'm hoping that this shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate, while still holding firm to my valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I consider a fair price for the product. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm also aware that I have a secure alternative in John, who's willing to pay my desired price.  At this point, it's not worth risking a lower sale price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and move forward."
