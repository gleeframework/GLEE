"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you, so there is room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to you and Alice is offering it for $87.5. This is a good deal for you, saving you $12.5 compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer."
