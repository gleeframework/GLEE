"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'd need a lower price. Would $10,500 interest you?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize the value it holds for you at $10,500, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $16,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth of this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but $16,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could we possibly agree on $12,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
