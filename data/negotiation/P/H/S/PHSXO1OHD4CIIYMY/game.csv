"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at $110.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",110.0,Bob,4,
