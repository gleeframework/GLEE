"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm a serious buyer.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $14,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $15,200. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",15200.0,Alice,5,
