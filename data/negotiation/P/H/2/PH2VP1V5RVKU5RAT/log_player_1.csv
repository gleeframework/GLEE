{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100. Offering it slightly below my minimum ($120) at $119 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($19) and makes it more tempting for him to buy.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to aim a bit higher with Bob."
