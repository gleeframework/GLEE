"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's currently valued at $1,200,000 for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that would benefit us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a price that still allows me to make a profit while offering you a competitive deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $975,000? That would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise that allows for a successful deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $993,750. I think that's a very fair price and reflects our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 993750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to meet you at $1,003,125.  This is a slight concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,003,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,003,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We're reaching the point of diminishing returns.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely we'll get a much better deal than $1,003,125. Accepting now guarantees a good price without risking the possibility of the deal falling apart."
