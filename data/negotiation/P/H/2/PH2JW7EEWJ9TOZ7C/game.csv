"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. It's currently valued at $1,200,000 for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that would benefit us both.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a price that still allows me to make a profit while offering you a competitive deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. How about $975,000? That would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise that allows for a successful deal. Let's make this happen.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $993,750. I think that's a very fair price and reflects our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",993750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to meet you at $1,003,125.  This is a slight concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1003125.0,Alice,7,
