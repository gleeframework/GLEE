"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Being friendly and positive can encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This price is well above my minimum and gives Bob a sense of potential savings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum ($80).** I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. 
* **I believe I can still get a better deal.**  I'm confident that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my asking price in future rounds.
* **Selling to John now would be a loss.**  I'm aiming for a higher profit than John's offer would provide."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $110?  I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Clear and Direct:**  I'm stating my counteroffer clearly and leaving the ball in Bob's court."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  Bob's offer is only $5 away from my initial offer of $110, which is close enough to my desired range. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are in Round 4, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a rejection. 
* **Better than Selling to John:** Accepting this offer gives me a much higher profit than selling to John. 

While I'd love to get even closer to my ideal price, I'm satisfied with this deal considering the time pressure and the potential risks of further negotiation."
