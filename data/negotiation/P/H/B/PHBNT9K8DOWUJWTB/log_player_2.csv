"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for that price. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting her offer. You can always buy from John for $120 if Alice doesn't come down in price."
