"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's above your minimum value ($80) and well below Bob's perceived value ($150).
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** By not asking for the full $150 immediately, you signal you're willing to compromise.
* **It sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation.

This offer gives you a good chance to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that leads to a profitable outcome for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $100 for your product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your starting offer of $120 and likely below your desired price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to your goal.  You can still use the threat of selling to John as leverage in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a good compromise and a fair price for this product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to negotiate but still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness:** You frame the $110 as a fair price, emphasizing a good deal for both parties.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 

By lowering your price slightly while still maintaining a firm stance, you hope to entice Bob into accepting the offer and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price."
