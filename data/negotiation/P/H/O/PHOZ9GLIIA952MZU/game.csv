"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I can't go any higher than that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price given my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000, but that's as low as I can go. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
