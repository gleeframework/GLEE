"Hey Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you say?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  This is a great deal for you and it lets me make a decent profit. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 isn't quite working for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
