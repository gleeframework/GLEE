"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a price that allows for a fair profit for me while still offering you a significant opportunity. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum valuation and above John's offer. You can do better by rejecting and seeing if Alice will counter with a lower price or going with John."
