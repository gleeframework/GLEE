"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750000 and $850000, so I'll offer $800000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
