"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting the $9,000 offer is a safe and cost-effective choice."
