Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive and confident:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and confident way to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a price closer to my ideal.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will tell me how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate. 
* **Maintain flexibility:** I can adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers or choose to sell to John if the negotiation becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is better than Bob's initial $6,000 offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price. 

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I will use this opportunity to try and understand his budget constraints better and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a little too low for me.  I understand you have a budget constraint, but I can't go that low.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with $8,500, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and his offer of $7,000. 
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and that my offer is still a good deal. 
* **Highlight budget constraint:**  I acknowledge his budget constraint but emphasize my need for a higher price. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  I'm still open to negotiation but making it clear that $8,500 is my bottom line for now. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a strong position:**  I'm not giving in too quickly and showing that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Increase Bob's willingness to pay:**  By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage him to consider my offer more seriously. 
* **Prepare for potential future negotiations:** I'm keeping my options open to adjust my price if needed in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, which is the lowest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach an agreement, I'm not willing to go any lower. It's better to sell to John for $8,000 and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirements. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Time constraint:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Potential future negotiations:**  Even if I rejected Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he would agree to a price closer to my minimum. 

By choosing to sell to John, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed profit and avoiding further negotiation that might not yield a favorable outcome."
