I'm offering Alice $9,000.  This is still a decent profit for her and a good deal for me. I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to walk away and go to John if she doesn't."

I'm going to offer Alice $9,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's a step closer to my target price. If she rejects this, I'm ready to buy from John."
