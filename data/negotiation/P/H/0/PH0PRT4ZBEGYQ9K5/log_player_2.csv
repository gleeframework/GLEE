"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at a price that fits your budget. 

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John directly."
