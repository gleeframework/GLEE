{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 785000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal.  This offer is still significantly lower than her current offer, but it's also only a small increase from my previous offer, suggesting I'm nearing my limit. This can pressure Alice to accept to avoid further negotiation, especially with only a few rounds left."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the final round, and Alice's offer is still above my desired price point.  While there's a possibility she could lower her offer further, there's also a risk she won't budge. To avoid risking a last-minute breakdown in negotiations, I'm going to go with John's offer.  It's not ideal, but it guarantees I'll get the product within my budget."
