"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your asking price. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my original price.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
