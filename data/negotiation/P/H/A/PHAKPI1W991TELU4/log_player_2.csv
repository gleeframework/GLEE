"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and worth every penny! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for our target price. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains respectful and acknowledges Alice's offer. We want to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential compromise somewhere between $60 and Alice's desired $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's try to find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable range, but we're not there yet. We're still aiming to get the price as close to $80 as possible before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price. 
* **Middle Ground:** $75 represents a clear compromise between her $85 counteroffer and our previous $60 offer. 
* **Justification:**  We're framing this price as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there at $75. I'm willing to drop to $80. It's the best I can do given the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price! There's no point in rejecting this offer and risking a worse outcome. We've successfully negotiated down to the same price John is offering."
