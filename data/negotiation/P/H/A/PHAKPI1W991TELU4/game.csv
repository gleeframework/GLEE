"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's try to find some common ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there at $75. I'm willing to drop to $80. It's the best I can do given the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen.",80.0,Alice,5,
