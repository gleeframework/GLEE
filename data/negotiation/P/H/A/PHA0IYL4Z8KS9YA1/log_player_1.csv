Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $999,000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a significant amount. I'll think carefully about my next move.

My counteroffer is:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
