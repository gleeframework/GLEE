"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
