"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $12,500.  If that works, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",14000.0,Alice,7,
