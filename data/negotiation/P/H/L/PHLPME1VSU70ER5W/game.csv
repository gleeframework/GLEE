"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $13000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is $12000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'd like to add a slight premium to account for the time and effort we've invested in this negotiation. I'm counteroffering $12200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to add a premium for the negotiation, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $12200. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $12000. I'm making a final offer of $12000. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $12200. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $800, which will bring the total value to you to $13000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12200, plus the service, for a total of $12200 + $800 = $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,7,
