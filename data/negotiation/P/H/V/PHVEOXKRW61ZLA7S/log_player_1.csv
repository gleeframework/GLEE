Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's split the difference at $1,325,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to come closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

This is a tough spot.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm running out of time, and I'm still not at a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee I reach my minimum."
