"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $140 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $117.50.
