"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your needs. Considering the product's intrinsic value to you is estimated at $150, I propose an offer of $120. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any suggestions for a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money and achieves your goal."
