Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done. I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  While you could try to haggle further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer"".  John's price at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product, even if it means spending a bit more than hoped."
