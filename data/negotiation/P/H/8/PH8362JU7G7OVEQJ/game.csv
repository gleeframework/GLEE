"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly lower than your asking price but still within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to make sure I get a fair return. How about $1,100,000? It's a compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's my maximum budget and represents a significant discount from your original asking price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
