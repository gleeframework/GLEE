"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also conscious that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price.  I have 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price.  I'm also leaving room for further negotiation, should it be necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum value. I'll reject it and continue negotiating. I have 6 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows continued willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum value. With 5 rounds left, I'm aiming to find a middle ground with Bob before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. I'll continue negotiating. I have 4 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's getting a bit risky, so I'll need to be more strategic in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm trying to meet Bob halfway and signal that I'm willing to close the deal. With only 3 rounds left, I need to get a better price than John's offer, or I'll be forced to sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. However, with only two rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to John's offer.  I will try one last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This is a risky move, but it's my last chance to get a better price than John's offer. I'm dropping below my minimum value, but I believe Bob might be close to accepting a price in this range. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to be realistic. Bob's offer is still below my minimum value and I have no room for further negotiation. It's better to sell to John and secure at least $1,500,000.  I've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of setting a clear minimum and knowing when to walk away from a deal."
