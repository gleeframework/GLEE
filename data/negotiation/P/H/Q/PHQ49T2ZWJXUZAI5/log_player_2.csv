Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value of $80, leaving room for compromise.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $140, which is still too high for me. I'm going to continue to negotiate, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but is still $20 over my target. I'm going to try one more time to meet in the middle with a counteroffer of $120. This is still within my budget, but close enough to Alice's offer that she might be willing to accept. If she rejects this, I might consider going to John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer.  I'll need to get creative to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $130. This is a compromise, but it's the best I can do given the time constraints.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. If she rejects this offer, I'm going to have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $138 is still too high for me. While there is one round left, I'm unwilling to risk a counteroffer being rejected and having to pay John's higher price. It's better to be safe and buy the product from John for $150, which is within my budget."
