Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,190,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll add a condition that I'll pay the full price of $1,150,000 upfront, but you'll also throw in some additional services or support to sweeten the deal.

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and willing to negotiate. While his price is stuck at $1,150,000, his willingness to add services or support indicates flexibility. I'll leverage this in the next round to try and secure a better deal."
