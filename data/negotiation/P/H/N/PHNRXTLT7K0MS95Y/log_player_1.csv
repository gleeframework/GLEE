Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin (Bob's value minus your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that profit margin as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.  A good strategy is to start high but leave some room for negotiation:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 gives you strong negotiating room. 
* **Value-Focused Message:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" emphasizes why Bob should be willing to pay a premium.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is polite and suggests you're open to discussion, even though you've started with a strong offer.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  You have some flexibility to go lower but don't drop below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  John provides a safety net, ensuring you don't have to accept an offer below your minimum."
