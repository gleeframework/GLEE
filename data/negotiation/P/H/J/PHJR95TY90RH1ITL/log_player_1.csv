""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While we know John will buy it for $12,000, getting Bob to pay more is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute bottom line ($12,000) leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. There's a chance he might accept the initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) might entice him if he sees potential long-term benefits or considers it a good deal.

By setting the price at $11,000, Alice creates a win-win scenario if Bob is willing to negotiate. If not, she has the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
