Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived worth and encourage a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still make counteroffers or sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer with a price that's more appealing to me, but still leaves room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $10,500, it's still a good deal for him.
* **Openness to Further Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion, suggesting that we can still work together to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a much better outcome. However, I am willing to test the waters for one more round with Bob to see if he might be willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This signals my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  This counteroffer is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects, I will move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is the closest he's gotten to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've negotiated with Bob for multiple rounds and reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a much better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
