"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better price than $12,000.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice only values the product at $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000 but still higher than Alice's valuation of $8,000. This gives Alice a chance to make a profit while still allowing Bob to save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John.  This offer starts the negotiation process, and Bob can adjust his offer based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves room for Alice to profit.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a breakdown, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. It's more prudent to accept the current offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
