"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $18000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $19000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a good value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
