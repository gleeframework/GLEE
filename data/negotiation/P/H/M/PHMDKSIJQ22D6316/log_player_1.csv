{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he's willing to pay anything below that. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 at the lowest.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit ($40) while still ensuring Bob gets a good deal ($20 less than his valuation). This price maximizes your profit while still being attractive to Bob."
