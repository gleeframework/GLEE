"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $11,500 saves you $500 compared to buying from John at $12,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that."
