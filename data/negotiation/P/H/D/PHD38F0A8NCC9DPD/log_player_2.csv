"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are only willing to spend a maximum of $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that, there is no benefit in negotiating.  Buying from John ensures you get the product at your maximum price without the risk of a longer negotiation."
