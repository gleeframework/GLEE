"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $14,000 is a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
