{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also signaling I'm open to his counteroffer, making the negotiation feel more collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $115. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although I'm close to Bob's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
