"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above what you value the product at."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for compromise. It's based on Alice's stated value of the product and should be within the range of a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price. He should continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still working towards his goal of getting the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but remains firm in his desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and propose $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a bad decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is still lower, Alice's offer of $8,875 is very close to his target and a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a significantly discounted price compared to John and avoids further negotiation.  With limited rounds left, the risk of further negotiation and a potential stalemate is not worth the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
