"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above what you value the product at.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and propose $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a bad decision. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
