"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as it's still above what you value the product at. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what I could get from John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target.  There are still 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to try and reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to take a slight risk and continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe there's room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and propose $8,875. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without either of us feeling like we've made a bad decision. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
