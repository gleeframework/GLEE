Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds and it's a risk that Alice will not accept my offer.  It's more certain to buy from John and guarantee the product for my desired price."
