"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to be within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a small compromise on my part, but it's the best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for me. Let's finalize this.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's aim for the middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $987,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?",987500.0,Bob,8,
