"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm starting the price at $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the product's inherent value and potential ROI warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
