Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or propose a new price.  However, I have a safety net with John's offer, so I won't be pressured into accepting a price that's too low."
