"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move designed to gauge Bob's interest and set the stage for negotiations. It's unlikely he'll accept this initial offer, but it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  While I was hoping to get a bit more from Bob, I've reached the end of the negotiation and don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is still a significant amount and above my minimum."
