"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there.  To be honest,  $800,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,,
