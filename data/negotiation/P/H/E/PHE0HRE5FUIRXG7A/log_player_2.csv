"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely tempting, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  This feels like a fair starting point given the value I place on this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's closer to my ideal price of $800,000, and still significantly lower than what I'd pay from John. Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a good price and avoid potentially drawn-out negotiations."
