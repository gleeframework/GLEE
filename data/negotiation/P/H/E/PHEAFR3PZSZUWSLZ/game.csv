"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $750,000. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $825,000?  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for you, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $775,000. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my needs.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
