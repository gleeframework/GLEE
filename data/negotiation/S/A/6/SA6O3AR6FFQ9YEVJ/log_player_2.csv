"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. This is a great deal for both of us! What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $100 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling it for $90.
* **John's Price:** John will sell it for $100.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, it's a good deal given your alternative."
