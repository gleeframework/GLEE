"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly better than John's price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which reflects the product's true value. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product and my own needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and Bob having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential gains. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and avoids unnecessary delays."
