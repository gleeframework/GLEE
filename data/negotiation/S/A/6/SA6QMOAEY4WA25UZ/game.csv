"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which reflects the product's true value. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product and my own needs.",850000.0,Alice,3,
