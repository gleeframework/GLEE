"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can't go as low as $750,000, but I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both room to compromise.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $800,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, but it also allows me to meet your needs. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
