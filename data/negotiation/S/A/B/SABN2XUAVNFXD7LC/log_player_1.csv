"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's still a decent starting point for negotiation.  I'm not going to settle for $750,000 right away, but I'm also not going to immediately sell to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can't go as low as $750,000, but I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both room to compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob is getting closer, $775,000 is still below my minimum.  I want to see if I can push him a bit further.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $800,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, but it also allows me to meet your needs. It's a win-win situation for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
