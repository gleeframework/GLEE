{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Polite and Conversational Tone:**  A friendly approach can foster a more agreeable negotiation. 
 
I'm prepared to negotiate down, but I'll always keep in mind John's standing offer of $100 as my absolute bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, but I still have room to negotiate. Accepting $120 would be leaving potential profit on the table. I'll provide a counteroffer slightly lower than my initial offer to encourage a deal while still aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle on $125? It's a great deal for a product you'll really value."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By countering with $125, I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above the midpoint between our initial prices ($125 is halfway between $120 and $130).
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him why paying a bit more is justifiable.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** My tone remains positive and solutions-oriented, showing I'm still aiming for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $122 is a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few more dollars, and there's a risk of Bob losing interest.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forths, allowing me to move on to other opportunities. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the time and effort involved might not be worth the potential marginal gain. Accepting Bob's offer at $122 secures a good profit and a quick sale."
