{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point as it is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially save a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down from her initial offer.  This counteroffer is a compromise: it's higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest offer. It gives Alice a chance to accept while potentially saving you some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly on her price, and her latest offer is only $100,000 lower than John's price. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John is the best option, as it guarantees you'll get the product within your budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
