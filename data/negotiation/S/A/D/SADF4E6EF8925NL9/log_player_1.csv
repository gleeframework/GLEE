"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have John as a guaranteed buyer at that price, so I'm not pressured to settle for less. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm comfortable rejecting his offer and continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 just doesn't cut it for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need at least $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it still leaves you with a very profitable deal.  Think about it, and let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,320,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,320,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $1,340,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price expectations.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk a failed deal, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
