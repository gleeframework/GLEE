"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. I'll offer $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 just doesn't cut it for me. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need at least $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and it still leaves you with a very profitable deal.  Think about it, and let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $1,320,000?",1320000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,320,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet at $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves us both with a profitable deal. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,7,
