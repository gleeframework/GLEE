"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,325,000 for the product. This is a very fair price, considering it's only $25,000 away from your last offer and significantly closer to my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,340,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
