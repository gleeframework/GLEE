"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,400,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,340,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?

Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has refused to go lower than $1,340,000.  While this is close to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Given the opportunity to buy the product from John for $1,200,000, it makes more sense for Bob to go with the cheaper option."
