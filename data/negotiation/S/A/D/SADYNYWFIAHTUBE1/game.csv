"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. This reflects the real worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,400,000,  which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the value you see in this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to close this deal, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
