"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm going to start with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully land a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can push for a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a small increase from Bob's offer, but I'm hoping it shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $930,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I believe I can potentially secure a deal in the next few rounds, but I'm keeping the option of selling to John open if it doesn't work out with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the offer and secure a deal, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my minimum price. We have several rounds remaining, and I want to try to maximize my earnings."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still pushing for a higher price.  We're getting closer to my minimum, and I'm hopeful that I can secure a deal within the next few rounds. However, if it doesn't work out, I'm prepared to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds and the offers are not getting me close to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out completely. It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John at this point."
