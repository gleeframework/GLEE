Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum value of $80, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Offering $100 leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $120.
* **It's friendly:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. You can likely get closer to your desired price point of $100 by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested! $85 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $92.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more flexibility. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Fairness:**  $92.50 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $120.
* **Positive messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is slightly lower than the $92.50 I was aiming for, it's still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum of $80 and very close to my desired price.  Given Bob's consistent negotiation and the fact that I can sell to John for $80, it makes sense to accept this offer and secure a sale."
