"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a high price, but it's a unique opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value.  If he's not, I'll start adjusting the price down in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next rounds, or I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this compromise is reasonable and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offers, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm also trying to emphasize my willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will push Bob to accept my offer in this round, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to sell yet. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'm also feeling optimistic about my chances to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,012,500?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's more beneficial for me while still being reasonable for Bob. This offer is a compromise that could lead to a deal in this round.  I'm also trying to emphasize the importance of finding a fair solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob. While $990,000 is close to my minimum value, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to agree to a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of losing out on a better deal."
