We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob's offer is getting close to John's guaranteed price, but there's still room to negotiate."

Bob's offer is now very close to my target, and significantly above John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a smaller gain risks him accepting John's offer instead. It's time to close the deal."
