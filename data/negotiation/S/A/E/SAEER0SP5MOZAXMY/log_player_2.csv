"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob wants to spend.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Offering $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might be appealing enough for Alice to consider.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob wants to spend.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  He's still better off with Alice than John, but he can likely get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of negotiating lower.  $11,000 is a compromise between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous counteroffer.  This could be appealing to Alice as it's closer to her ideal selling price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still higher than what Bob wants to spend.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a better price. He is still getting a better deal with Alice than with John, and he's confident he can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly, but he's still pushing for a better price than Alice's last offer.  $12,000 represents a good compromise, and Alice might be willing to accept to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best price possible. While $14,000 is closer to his maximum budget, there's still a chance to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make one final counteroffer before having to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for a better price.  $13,000 is a significant compromise, and Alice might be willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and the possibility of losing the deal. If Alice rejects, Bob is prepared to buy from John at $15,000, as this is now the best outcome for him given the limited time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last round with Alice. Alice's offer of $14,500 is too close to his maximum budget, and he's not willing to risk further negotiation with only one round left. It's better to secure the product from John at $15,000 than to risk getting a worse deal or no deal at all with Alice."
