Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

Reasoning: Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate by lowering her price. This round, we're raising our offer slightly, showing we're serious about buying but also pushing for a more favorable price.  If Alice rejects, we can still adjust our offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
