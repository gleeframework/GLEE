"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $120, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While the product might be worth $80 to Alice, that's her cost, not necessarily your perceived value. 
* You're willing to pay up to $150, so getting it for $120 is a good deal."
