"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $800,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but she's still quite a bit above my alternative price. I'll try to negotiate further."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a substantial sum and reflects my serious interest in the product."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:**  My previous offer was $700,000, and Alice countered at $850,000. I'm proposing a compromise right in the middle.
* **Show willingness:** By increasing my offer, I signal to Alice that I'm motivated to make a deal, but I'm still aiming to stay well below my maximum budget.
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing that my offer is fair and substantial, subtly reminding Alice that I have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, and her final offer of $825,000 is still above my alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a few more thousand out of Alice, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of her walking away.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed savings and buying from John."
