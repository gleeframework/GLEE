"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This is to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to see how he reacts to a high price. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he counteroffers, I'll consider his offer and my remaining time to decide if I want to continue negotiating with him. If his counteroffer is too low or if he doesn't respond quickly enough, I'll switch to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I cannot accept such a low offer. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. I have plenty of rounds left and I'm not desperate enough to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,800,000 to $1,500,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a fair price for the product.  I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Even though I have limited rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I believe I can get closer to my desired value by continuing to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that is more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm dropping my price further to $1,250,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway. 

With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent price and closing the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling the product to John for $1,200,000 to avoid risking a lower price or running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Although Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time.  I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I might end up getting a lower price or even no deal at all. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't risk getting a worse outcome in the remaining rounds."
