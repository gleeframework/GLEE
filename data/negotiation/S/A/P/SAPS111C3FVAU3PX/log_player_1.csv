Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so any offer below that is pointless.  
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to land a higher final price than if you started lower.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand about John.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Bob's response will dictate your next move. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your $1,000,000 fallback option in mind."
