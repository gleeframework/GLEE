"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $82? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $78? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a bit more. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise. How about we meet at $82.50?",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $80.50. Can you meet me at that price?",80.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $83?",83.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not willing to pay $83. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so how about we try $81.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be within my budget.",81.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $84. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $82.25? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",82.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but I've reached my limit for negotiations. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a price I'm comfortable with. I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. How about we meet at $80? It's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",80.0,Bob,10,
