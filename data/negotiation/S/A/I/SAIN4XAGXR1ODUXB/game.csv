"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering your valuation and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. Considering the product's value to you is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11500? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
