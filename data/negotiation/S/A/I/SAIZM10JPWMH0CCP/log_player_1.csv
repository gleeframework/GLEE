Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you need to aim higher with Bob to maximize your profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob while still exceeding your guaranteed offer from John."
