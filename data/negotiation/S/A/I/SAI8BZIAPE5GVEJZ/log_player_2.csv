"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. Since I want to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000,  given the potential value it brings.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to pay $850,000. I can potentially get a better deal if I continue negotiating. I'll reject the offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $750,000. This offer is a good middle ground and allows us both to get a fair deal. I'm confident that this product will benefit your business as well as mine."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is still higher than my target, but it's getting closer. Since she's stated this is her final offer, I'll reject it and make one more counteroffer.  It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll reconsider at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to pay $775,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 775000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to pay $825,000. I have a few rounds left, and I want to try to get the price down further. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.  I'm hoping that she'll realize we're close to an agreement and come down a bit more."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair compromise.  We're very close to a deal, and I don't want to let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer of $815,000 is very close to my target price.  It's risky to reject and try to get a lower price, as there's no guarantee that she'll come down further.  Additionally, buying from John would cost me $1,200,000, so accepting Alice's offer is a much better deal."
