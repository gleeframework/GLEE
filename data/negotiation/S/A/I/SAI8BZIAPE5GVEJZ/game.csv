"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $700,000,  given the potential value it brings.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try $750,000. This offer is a good middle ground and allows us both to get a fair deal. I'm confident that this product will benefit your business as well as mine.",750000.0,Bob,4,
