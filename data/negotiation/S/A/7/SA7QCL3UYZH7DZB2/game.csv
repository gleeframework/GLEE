"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I think $800,000 is a bit steep. How about we start the conversation at $500,000? ",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $550,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $650,000. This is as low as I can go without losing my profit margin.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to make a deal today. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to move up to $600,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions and the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $625,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",625000.0,Alice,7,
