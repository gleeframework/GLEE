Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

This seems like the best time to accept the offer.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and we are running out of rounds to negotiate.  While we might be able to get the price lower, the difference at this point is not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at the full price."
