"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is this something you're interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering me. However, $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm very interested in the product and would be happy to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a little out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $112.50. I can offer you a compromise at $120. This is still a good price, and I think you'll find it's worth it for the value the product provides.",120.0,Alice,5,
