,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the benefits you'll reap. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
