"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250?  That way, we both get a good deal.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $9750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9750 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $10000. How about we settle on $10000? That way, we both get a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
