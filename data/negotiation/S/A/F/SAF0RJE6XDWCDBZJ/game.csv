"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is the lowest price I can accept. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",125.0,Alice,5,
