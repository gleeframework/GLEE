"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which is a fair price based on my assessment.  Let's see if we can work something out.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I think this is a reasonable starting point.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",725000.0,Alice,5,
