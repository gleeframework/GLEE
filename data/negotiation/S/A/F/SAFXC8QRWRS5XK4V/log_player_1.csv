Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the potential value, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000, which is a fair price based on my assessment.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
