"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, as it's still well below Bob's perceived value of the product, but it also gives me a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to ensure a deal is reached within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving away too much. I believe this price is a good balance between securing a deal and maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, accepting $920,000 ensures a deal in this round.  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I need to be mindful of the time constraint. It's a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
