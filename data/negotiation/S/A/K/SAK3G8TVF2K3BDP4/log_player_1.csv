"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this offer reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and emphasizing the ""return on investment,"" I'm attempting to frame the price in a way that appeals to Bob's potential profit, even if he initially perceives the price as high. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high starting point signals that I'm willing to negotiate, which is important in multi-round bargaining.

My goal is to get Bob invested in the negotiation process while aiming to secure a deal significantly above his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value and still considerably below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a substantial jump from his initial perception, I have room to negotiate and believe I can push for a better outcome within the remaining rounds. Selling to John right now would be settling for my absolute minimum, and I think there's potential to get closer to $1,500,000 or even higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise while still acknowledging the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant drop from my initial offer ($2,200,000 to $1,800,000). This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and move closer to his range. 
* **Holding Ground:**  Even with the concession, I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This keeps the pressure on him to justify his valuation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" and ""realistic compromise"" to encourage Bob to see this as a collaborative negotiation, not a win-lose scenario.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will prompt Bob to either significantly increase his offer or reveal more information about his budget and priorities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I am now willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Become Frustrated:**  Prolonging the negotiation could make Bob feel like I'm not negotiating in good faith.
* **Walk Away:** There's always a chance, however small, that Bob might decide the deal isn't worth the hassle and withdraw completely.

Accepting the $1,600,000 offer represents a strong profit above my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
