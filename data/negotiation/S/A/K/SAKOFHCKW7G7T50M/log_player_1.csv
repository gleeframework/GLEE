{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a chance to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell it for less than $150. I'll counter his offer with a price that's closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer with a price that's slightly higher, hoping we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be flexible here.  $130 is still a little low for me, but to show you I'm willing to meet you halfway, I'll come down to $135. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm not willing to go lower than $125.  Even though I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm better off selling to John for $150.  I'm confident I can get a better price with a different buyer in the future."
