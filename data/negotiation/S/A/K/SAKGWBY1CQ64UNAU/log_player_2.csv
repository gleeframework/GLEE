You have three options:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try $7,500. It's a small increase, but it shows my willingness to meet you halfway.  If you're not able to go that high, I might need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not going to go much lower than $7,500.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, saving you the hassle of further negotiation and potential for Alice to back out completely."
