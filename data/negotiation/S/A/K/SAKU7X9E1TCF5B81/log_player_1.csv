Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $17,000, which reflects its true value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high.  There's a chance Bob might accept a price higher than his perceived value, especially if you frame it well.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The $17,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he counters, you're still likely to get a price higher than $15,000.
* **Confident messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and doesn't reveal your minimum acceptable price, giving you a stronger negotiating position. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective. 
* **Market conditions:** This assumes you're not in a rush to sell. If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more competitive price might be necessary."
