"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering our mutual interests.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd pay elsewhere and still leaves you with a healthy profit.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
