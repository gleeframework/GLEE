I'm willing to make you a one-time offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal today. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $950,000 is less than $1,000,000.
* **You can potentially get a better deal:** You have a goal to save as much money as possible. Since you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
