"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to let it go for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This offer is reasonable, considering the value for both of us, and it would bring us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm offering it to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
