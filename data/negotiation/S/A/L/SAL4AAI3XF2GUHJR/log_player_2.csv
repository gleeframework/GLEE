Round 5
Alice's offer:

""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! How about splitting the difference and going for $140? That seems fair to me."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $142.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's not the ideal price, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $142 gets you the product for less than John's offer and avoids potentially missing out entirely."
