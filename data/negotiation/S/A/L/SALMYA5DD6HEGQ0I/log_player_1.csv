Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic starting point:

* **Above Bob's value:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Below my minimum:** It's still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me space to bargain if needed.
* **Room for compromise:** It allows for a middle ground to be found during negotiation.

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I hope to create an incentive for him to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get for the product.  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell for a significantly lower price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Still above my minimum:** It ensures that I am still making a profit even if Bob accepts. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's still lower than I'd prefer, it's a good compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection. It's also a good starting point for future negotiations with other buyers."
