Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is clearly very attached to a price above $900,000. We still have room to negotiate downwards and it's unlikely she'll want to waste this deal over 25k. Let's keep pushing a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working to find a price that works for both of us. While your product is good, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the current market."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000.

It seems like Alice is getting very stubborn.  We're close, but we're running out of rounds.  Let's see if we can pressure her a little in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your time, but I'm getting close to walking away from this deal. I can get a similar product elsewhere for a million. I'm willing to do $905,000, but that's absolutely my best offer.  If you can't do that, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 905000}"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $905,000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $910,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems like we've reached an impasse with Alice.  She's unwilling to budge below $910,000, and we're only going to irritate her with further negotiation.  It's not worth risking the entire deal for the remaining $10,000 difference.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most logical choice now."
