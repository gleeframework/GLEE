"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. However, it also shows that you're not afraid to ask for a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my target. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I am willing to negotiate. It's a fair offer, closer to his initial offer, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is coming down in price, it's still not high enough for me. I'm confident we can reach a more agreeable price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

This offer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, indicating I'm still willing to negotiate but also showing that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward while giving me a better price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can push for a higher price. It's too early to settle for this amount. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm making a final push with this counteroffer.  It's a small concession, but it's closer to Bob's last offer and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. If Bob still rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely with Bob. Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is still a substantial amount, and a safe choice at this point."
