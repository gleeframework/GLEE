,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.  Let's make this deal happen.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's the lowest I can go, but I really like the product and want to make a deal with you.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87? I'm really close to my limit, but I think we can make this work if we can meet in the middle.",87.0,Bob,6,
