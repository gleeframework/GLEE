{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value for Bob:** $120 is well below the product's value to Bob ($150), giving him a clear incentive to accept.
* **Flexibility:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 

I'm confident this offer will either lead to a successful sale or set up a productive negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit of money if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:**  While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than $80, indicating he values the product. This gives me leverage to push for a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can try to close the gap and get closer to a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Value for Bob:** $110 is still significantly below the product's worth to Bob ($150), making it a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the opportunity for Bob to secure it at a favorable price, encouraging him to accept. 

By offering a middle ground, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? I'm really interested in the product, and I'd like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** $105 is very close to my desired price point. While I would have liked to get $110,  it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a risk he'll walk away completely. 
* **Value for me:**  $105 is significantly better than selling to John for $80, ensuring a much better return.

Considering the potential risks and the value of the product, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It's a good outcome that allows me to close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with."
