The product is far above Bob's budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is trying to get a good deal, so he's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer.  This will likely be rejected, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to save some money.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  This shows he's willing to negotiate, but is serious about getting a good price."

Bob is taking a risk by offering a price closer to his maximum, but he's hoping Alice will be willing to meet him halfway.  It's a good compromise between his last offer and Alice's latest one."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's still willing to try for a lower price.  There's a possibility Alice might be more flexible at this point, so a final counteroffer is worth trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

Bob is taking one last shot at getting a better price. This is a slightly higher offer than his previous one, but it's still below Alice's current offer, and only $500 above his maximum. This shows he's serious about buying, but is trying to squeeze out the best possible deal."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob has negotiated as much as he can with Alice. While $17,500 is a good price, it's still above his maximum limit. It's time to move on and purchase from John for a guaranteed $15,000."
