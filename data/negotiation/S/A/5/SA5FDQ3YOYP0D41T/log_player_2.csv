"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than what you know you can get it for from John. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay above your limit. Alice loses some leverage knowing you have another option."
