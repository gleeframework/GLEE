"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his perceived worth.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds while still allowing me to potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my value floor. 
* **I believe there is still room for negotiation.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount, and potentially work towards a more favorable outcome.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and benefits."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price point.  
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the new price as a compromise, emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits, subtly increasing its perceived value in his mind. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still not at my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain the potential for a more favorable outcome. 
* **The safety net of John:**  Remember, selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if I can't reach a deal with Bob.

I'm confident I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob seems interested and willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $10,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer, but not too much:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum threshold. This shows flexibility without compromising my goals.
* **Highlighting the discount:**  I emphasize the ""significant discount"" to make it seem like a more attractive deal for Bob.
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I position the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially making it harder for him to reject. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while still leaving room for one more round if necessary before I default to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are at round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While there's always the chance of a breakthrough in further negotiations, the risk of continuing with Bob is growing. 

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Time is ticking:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential for a deal with Bob seems increasingly uncertain. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is a sure thing and will pay my minimum price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation for a lower profit margin.
* **Bob's budget constraints:** Bob has consistently mentioned budget limitations, suggesting he might not be willing to go much higher.

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, securing the guaranteed profit from John is the most sensible and risk-averse option at this stage."
