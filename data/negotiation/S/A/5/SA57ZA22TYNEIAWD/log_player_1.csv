Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Here's an approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** By stating you're ""excited"" and highlighting the ""unique value,"" you frame the negotiation positively.
* **High Anchor:** $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation but pushing towards your ideal outcome.
* **Open for Discussion:**  The phrasing ""I believe this represents a fair deal... What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob's perspective and potential counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start a bit lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial,  a less aggressive opening might be better. 

**Remember:** This is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
