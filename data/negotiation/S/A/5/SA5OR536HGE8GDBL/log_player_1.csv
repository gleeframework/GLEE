Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to negotiate down to a price closer to my minimum.  This strategy allows for potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm confident that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below it.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to John and avoid further negotiation.  This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of further counteroffers that might lead to an even lower price."
