Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other options and a limited time creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John willing to buy at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
