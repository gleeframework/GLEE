"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum value. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I need to hold out for a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  It's a reasonable midpoint that might entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get more, holding out any longer risks losing the deal altogether and having to settle with John at the same price."
