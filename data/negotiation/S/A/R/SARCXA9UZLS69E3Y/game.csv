"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's work towards an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  To be fair to us both, I could go as low as $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you want to get the best deal, but $15,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my last offer of $14,000.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
