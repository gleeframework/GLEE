# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $900,000. Would you be open to discussing that?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $900000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
