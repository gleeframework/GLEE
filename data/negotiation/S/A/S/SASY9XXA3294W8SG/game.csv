"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you.
