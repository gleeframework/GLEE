Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too low for me, especially considering his value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,250,000. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
