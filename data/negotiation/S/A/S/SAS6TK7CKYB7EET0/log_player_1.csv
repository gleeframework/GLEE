Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to him, but still a very profitable deal for me. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. But, I'm also ready to sell to John if necessary to ensure I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is still a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point in the next round. I'll still be prepared to sell to John if necessary, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for him, considering he values the product at $1,500,000, and it keeps me closer to my target profit.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'm hopeful that I can secure a price closer to my target before having to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,200,000. This is my final offer before considering John's offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's worth to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be accepting John's offer and ending the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is just barely above my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get closer to my target, I've already made multiple concessions.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  It's a guaranteed profit, and I've spent too much time negotiating with Bob already."
