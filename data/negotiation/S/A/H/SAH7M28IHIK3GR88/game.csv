"Bob, I understand your position. However, $13,000 is still below what I can accept. How about $13,250? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset for you. Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,900 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $13,100. It's a fair price that takes both our needs into consideration. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",13100.0,Alice,7,
