"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $1,400,000.  Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm open to negotiation. However, the product's value to me is quite significant. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $1,300,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, Alice has shown she's willing to meet halfway. There's a risk that further negotiation could result in a higher price or Alice withdrawing her offer.
* **Value to Bob is unknown:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, we don't know Bob's true valuation. $1,300,000 might be a good deal for Bob, even if he could potentially get it for slightly less. 

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most sensible option as it secures the product within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
