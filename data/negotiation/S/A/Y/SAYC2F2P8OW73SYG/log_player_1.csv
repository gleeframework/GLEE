Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unwilling to meet the minimum threshold. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
