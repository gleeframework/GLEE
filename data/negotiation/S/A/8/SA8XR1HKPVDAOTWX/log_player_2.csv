"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How does $120 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You know the product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is also willing to sell it for $120.  Since John is also willing to sell it for $120, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You might as well buy it from John."
