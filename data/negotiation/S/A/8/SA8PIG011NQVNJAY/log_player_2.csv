"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $12,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob starts by making a reasonable counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still a respectable amount. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives Alice a starting point to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value of the product, I believe we should aim for a more equitable transaction. How about considering $11,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. While it's a step closer, Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob continues to push for a lower price. He's now just $500 above his maximum budget, showing a willingness to compromise but still being firm in his stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we meet in the middle at $10,800? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's a good deal closer, Bob has two options now:

1. **Reject and Counter:**  Bob could counteroffer at $10,500, hoping to squeeze out a little more.
2. **Buy from John:**  However, with only five rounds remaining, it's risky to keep negotiating.  Bob might not get a better offer from Alice, and he could risk losing the product entirely.  

Given the limited rounds, the safest option is to reject the offer and counter with a lower price.  If it doesn't work, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $10,800 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's the best I can do, and I'm ready to close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's counteroffer is now only $500 above his maximum budget.  This is a clear signal to Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. 

It's a risky move because there are only four rounds left.  If Alice rejects, Bob has to decide whether to buy from John or risk losing the product entirely. But, it's also a good strategy because it shows Bob's commitment to a fair deal and puts pressure on Alice to close the deal."
