"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value of the product, I believe we should aim for a more equitable transaction. How about considering $11,500 for the product?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, how about we meet in the middle at $10,800? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $10,800 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's the best I can do, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",10500.0,Bob,6,
