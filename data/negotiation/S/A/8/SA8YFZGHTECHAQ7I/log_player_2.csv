"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her product's value to her ($150), you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to achieve your goal of saving as much money as possible."
