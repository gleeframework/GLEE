"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the benefits the product can bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the compromise, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not convinced that $14000 is the best deal. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,6,
