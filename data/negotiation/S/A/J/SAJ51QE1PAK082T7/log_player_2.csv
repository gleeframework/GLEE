"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're getting started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000.  This is a bad deal for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than before, it is still above his budget of $800,000. He should continue negotiating or consider buying from John."

Bob has reached his limit. Alice is firm on $900,000, which is still above his budget.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for $800,000.  It's a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
