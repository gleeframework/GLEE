Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant amount to the right buyer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a  chance to acquire it at a price below its true value to me."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (your minimum acceptable price).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your target.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the fact that Bob is getting a ""deal"" compared to your alternative offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes you have no immediate pressure to sell and can afford to risk Bob rejecting the offer.
*  A lot depends on your negotiation style and your relationship with Bob. You could choose to be more aggressive or more accommodating depending on the situation."
