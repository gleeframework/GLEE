"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a healthy profit.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.  I'll be ready to negotiate down if needed, but I'm going to see how much I can get in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more appealing price for Bob. I'm hoping that we can find a middle ground in this round."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle yet. I'm going to see if I can get a higher price in the next round.  I have time on my side, and I don't want to lose out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm holding out for a better deal. I have John as a backup buyer, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I still need to make a profit.  $1,025,000 is a compromise that feels like a fair price, and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal."
