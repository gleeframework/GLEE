"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,400,000.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That said, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,175,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this process, and I appreciate that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,125,000? That's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 1125000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's try one last compromise.  How about $1,150,000?  This gives us both some room to work with, and we can finally close this deal.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and while there might be a tiny bit more wiggle room, getting the price down $150,000 is a good deal. Holding out for a slightly better offer from Alice risks her accepting your previous offer or, worse, you ending up with John's offer and a higher price."
