"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,400,000.  This is a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. That said, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a little high.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1,175,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this process, and I appreciate that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,125,000? That's the best I can do.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's try one last compromise.  How about $1,150,000?  This gives us both some room to work with, and we can finally close this deal.  I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
