"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $105, which is a good deal for you. You're getting the product for $15 less than what it's worth to you, and it's still cheaper than buying from John."
