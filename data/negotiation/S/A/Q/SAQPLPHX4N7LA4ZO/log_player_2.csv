"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). This means there is room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price before resorting to buying from John at a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price. I'm confident I can get the price down further through negotiation.  I'll make another counteroffer."
