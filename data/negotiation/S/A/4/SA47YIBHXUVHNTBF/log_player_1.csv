Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 is still a significant profit for you. It's also a price point that offers substantial value to Bob, as it's considerably less than his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer without trying to negotiate a lower price."
