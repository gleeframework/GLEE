"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and leaves Bob with a good deal.  This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired $1,150,000. There's still time in the negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a good profit and is likely to be accepted by Bob. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price, and we're already at round 4.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds, and there's a risk of him walking away entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and secures the sale."
