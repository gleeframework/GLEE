Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and I'm hoping you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but Bob will only buy if the price is below his perceived value ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($150) allows room for Bob to negotiate (even if he doesn't) and makes the $149 seem like a potential bargain. 
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John."
