Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup buyer at $12,000. 

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you can take a slightly bolder approach with Bob. The goal is to see if you can get more than $12,000, but you don't want to scare him away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,500, which reflects the value it brings.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  You're starting above both Bob's perceived value and your minimum.
* **Justification:** You're vaguely mentioning ""value"" to encourage Bob to think beyond just his initial assessment. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $1,500 buffer above your minimum allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob flatly refuses or tries to negotiate below $12,000, politely decline and move on to John.
* **Be Flexible (Slightly):**  If Bob counters with an offer close to $12,000 (e.g., $12,500), it might be worth accepting to secure the deal quickly."
