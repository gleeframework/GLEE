"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, as it's worth a lot more to me than that. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer of $115 is better than John's offer of $120, but still above Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer makes sense, as Bob can get a better deal from John."
