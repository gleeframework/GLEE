"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than you're willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and my budget.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $875,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",885000.0,Alice,5,
