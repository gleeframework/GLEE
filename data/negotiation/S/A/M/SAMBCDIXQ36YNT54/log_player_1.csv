Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but just below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you don't go below your minimum.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer."
