{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to him and at least $80 to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, I believe I can do better. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90.  This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my desired price point and still leaves room for further negotiation."
