"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value.  This allows room for negotiation and leaves me with a potential profit.  It's also important to build rapport with Bob by starting with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him up to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
