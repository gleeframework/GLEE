{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering its significant value to you. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without making him reject the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price slightly below his valuation leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, so we shouldn't go below that price.

By offering the product at $1,100,000, we maximize our potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
