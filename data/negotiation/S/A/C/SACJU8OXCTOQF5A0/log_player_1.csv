"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""potential"" of the product, the offer subtly implies that Bob will gain significant value, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""starting point for our discussion"" signals willingness to negotiate, preventing an immediate deadlock.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and keeping him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own stated value ($1,000,000). This suggests he has room to move significantly. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to negotiate further. 

While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's a good chance to secure a price significantly higher than $800,000 if you play your cards right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However,  $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** Coming down to $875,000 from $950,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but remains firmly within a profitable range.
* **Highlight Value (Again):** Re-emphasizing the ""potential"" reminds Bob of the inherent value he gains, justifying the price point.
* **Midpoint Target:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a midpoint between your initial ask and his low offer, ideally landing somewhere above $800,000.

This strategy maintains a balance between firmness on value and a willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, now at $750,000. However, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. He's also consistently anchoring his offers around the initial lowball of $700,000. By continuing to reject offers below your threshold, you maintain a firm negotiating position and signal that you're serious about getting a fair price. 

While selling to John is always an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob, who clearly sees value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be sure this deal makes financial sense for me as well.  Let's settle this right now. If you agree to $850,000, we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Price:** This counteroffer establishes a firm price of $850,000. It's a strong stance that signals the end of major concessions.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""settle this right now"" introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Simplified Decision:** Offering a clear ""take it or leave it"" deal simplifies the decision-making process for Bob, potentially leading to a faster resolution. 

This strategy aims for a swift and favorable conclusion. It maintains a price above your minimum while acknowledging Bob's attempts to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $780,000 to get this deal done.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product and is only increasing his offer in small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach your minimum of $800,000 within the remaining rounds.  

While continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, it also carries the risk of Bob walking away or your best offer being even lower than John's. 

Therefore, the most logical decision at this point is to **sell the product to John for the guaranteed $800,000**.  This secures a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
