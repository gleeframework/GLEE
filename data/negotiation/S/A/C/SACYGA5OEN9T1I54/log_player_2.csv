# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on your investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her perceived value, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move forward with your backup plan and secure the best possible price."
