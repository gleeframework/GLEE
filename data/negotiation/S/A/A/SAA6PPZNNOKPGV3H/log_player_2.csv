You can do better than $110. You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."

You can still do better than $112.50.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is still too high.  See if you can get Alice to come down a bit more."

Alice has come down to $108, which is within your budget and a good deal for both parties.  It's better than John's price and still allows you to save some money."
