"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not able to meet you at $1,200,000. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this is within the range you're considering.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle on $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
