"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the unique nature of the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $175. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on that.",100.0,Bob,4,
