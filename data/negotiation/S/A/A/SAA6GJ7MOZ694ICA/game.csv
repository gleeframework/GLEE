"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it shows I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a price we're both happy with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this last offer, so how about $1,025,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiations.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  we're almost there. I'm willing to come down to $990,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $990,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $990,000, so how about $982,500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",982500.0,Bob,8,
