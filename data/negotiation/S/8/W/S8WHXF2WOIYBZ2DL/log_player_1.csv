Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me.
* **John's Value:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000. This means I have a ""safety net"" and can afford to be more ambitious with my offer to Bob.
* **Potential Upside:**  By offering $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting a better price. If Bob is willing to pay more, I benefit. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There is a risk that Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm comfortable with this risk as I have a guaranteed sale to John. 

By offering a price higher than my minimum and leaving room for negotiation, I maximize my potential earnings while minimizing my risk."
