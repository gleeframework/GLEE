"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm going to stick to my initial offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm very close to my target but I'm still not there yet.  I'm offering $900,000.  This is a very fair price considering your previous offer and my budget, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
