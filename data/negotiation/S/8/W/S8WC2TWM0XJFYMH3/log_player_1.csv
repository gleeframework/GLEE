{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is strategically placed:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to counter.
* **Lower than your minimum:** It provides a potential gain for you, but still allows for some flexibility.

This strategy maximizes your chances of securing a deal that is beneficial to you while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to make a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,250,000 is still too far below my desired price point. I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,300,000.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

This negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure deal with John."
