{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly below what I consider the minimum for myself, giving Bob some wiggle room to feel like he's getting a good deal while still leaving me a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still potentially get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
