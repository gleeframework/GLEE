"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a good price, but you can likely get it for less.
* You have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.
* Buying from John for $120 is your fallback option, so you have nothing to lose by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to get the best possible price while still ensuring a deal. 
*  $85 is a fair middle ground between your target price ($120) and Alice's offer ($95). 
* This counteroffer shows you are serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is still a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum value of $120. 
* There is a risk that you might not get a better price in the next round. 
* It's likely Alice won't go lower than $85, which is your previous offer.
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids further negotiation."
