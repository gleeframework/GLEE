"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value, I believe it's worth $95 for you. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her value. This strategy:

* **Signals interest:** We're not rejecting outright, showing we're willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for bargaining:**  A lower starting point gives us space to increase our offer gradually if needed.
* **Aims for a good deal:**  Ideally, Alice might accept a price closer to our initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85 for the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to the middle ground, but $85 is still above our target price. We'll politely decline and continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the adjustment, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $75? I think that would be a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** We are slowly increasing our offer to signal that we are willing to move towards her price, but we're still aiming for a price closer to our target.
* **Fairness appeal:** By suggesting $75, we are positioning it as a compromise that benefits both parties. This tactic can encourage agreement. 
* **Continued negotiation:** We are still significantly below our maximum budget, allowing for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I think we can agree on $80 for the transaction. This would be a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met us at her own value for the product.  This is unlikely to get any better, and it's a good deal for us. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down and having to settle for John's higher price."
