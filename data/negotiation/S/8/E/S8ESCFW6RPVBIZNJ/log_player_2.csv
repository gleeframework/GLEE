"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $10,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  While Alice is trying to frame the offer as a great deal,  Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,800. This is still a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $12,000. Accepting the offer saves him $2,200 compared to buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll end up paying $12,000 to John. It's a calculated risk to accept, but the potential savings outweigh the risk."
