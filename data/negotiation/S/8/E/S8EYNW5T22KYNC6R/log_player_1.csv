"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We want to anchor the negotiation high, closer to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 signals that we are open to negotiation and willing to move down from our initial price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to create a collaborative atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer confirms the product's significant value to him. Rejecting this offer signals we believe a better deal is possible without seeming overly aggressive. We'll use the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you offering a price. I understand the value you see in this product, and I'm keen on reaching an agreement that benefits both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and compromise. It's a strong signal that we are aiming for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While we are moving closer to Bob's offer, the $1,025,000 price keeps us firmly above our minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Language:** We continue using positive and collaborative language to foster a constructive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. I hope this suggestion is within the range you are considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to close the deal. However, we still have room to negotiate and are aiming for a higher price. We'll use the next round to nudge him closer to the $1 million mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen - how about we settle at $1,000,000 even? It's a strong price that reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Psychological Threshold:**  Offering $1,000,000 creates a strong psychological anchor. It's a round number that feels significant and might be more appealing to Bob than incremental increases.
* **Conveying Urgency:** By framing it as ""let's make this happen,"" we inject a sense of urgency and opportunity, encouraging Bob to accept this offer.
* **Balancing Profit and Deal Closure:**  While we could continue pushing for a higher price, securing a $1,000,000 deal at this stage represents a significant profit and reduces the risk of Bob walking away."
