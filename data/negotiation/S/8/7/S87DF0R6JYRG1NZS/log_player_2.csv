"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to get the product for under $150.
* Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's offer of $150, but you can likely get a better price.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to get the product for under $150, and ideally closer to your value of $80.
* A counteroffer of $100 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $120, showing your intent to negotiate.
* This price is still higher than Alice's value of $80, leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is better than John's offer of $150.
* You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and while this price is still higher than your ideal, it's getting closer. 
*  Further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a reasonable price, and minimizes the risk of the negotiation falling apart and leaving you with John's higher price."
