Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above your minimum acceptable value, giving you room to negotiate. It also leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth a bit less than $140. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping to get closer to your asking price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132.50 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable value of $120 and closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
