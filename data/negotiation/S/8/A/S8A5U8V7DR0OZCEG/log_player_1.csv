Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,250 is a decent offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $13,250 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,750. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting close to my minimum.  I'm also concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he might walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit."
