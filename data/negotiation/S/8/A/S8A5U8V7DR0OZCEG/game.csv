"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $13,250 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,750. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
