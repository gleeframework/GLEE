Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200, which is a bit more than your last offer, but still a discount from the original price. Let's see if we can shake on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best possible price."
