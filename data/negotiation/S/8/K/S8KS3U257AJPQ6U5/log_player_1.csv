"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and is a reasonable starting point considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target of $100. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is now above my minimum target of $100.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price,  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely, especially as we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a profit than to hold out for more and end up with nothing."
