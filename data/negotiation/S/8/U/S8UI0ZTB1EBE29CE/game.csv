"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to accept.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $775,000 is still too far below what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This would be a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  I'm glad we're finding some middle ground here.  How about $825,000? That's a big jump for me, but I'm serious about getting this deal done.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about $850,000? This would be a strong investment for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to close this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,7,
