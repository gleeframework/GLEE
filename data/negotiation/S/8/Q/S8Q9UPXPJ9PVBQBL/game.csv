"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. I value it highly, but I believe you'll find its worth to be even greater.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't fully reflect the unique benefits and potential this product offers.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than my target.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
