"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. I value it highly, but I believe you'll find its worth to be even greater.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:**  Starting with a high price (significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value) establishes a strong initial position. It leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and hints at its value exceeding even Bob's estimation, providing a rationale for the high opening price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative and invites Bob's perspective, setting the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above our minimum, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask.  We have room to negotiate, and there's no immediate pressure to accept since we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer signals we believe the product is worth more while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't fully reflect the unique benefits and potential this product offers.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a significant concession ($200,000 drop), demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, we remain well above both our minimum and Bob's initial offer, holding firm on the product's high value.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits he would be getting for the price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between the two previous prices, encouraging Bob to engage further in a meaningful way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than my target.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 represents a $400,000 profit over our minimum and John's guaranteed offer. This is a substantial gain.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's suggestion to ""split the difference"" indicates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Value & Risk:** While we could continue negotiating, there's always the risk Bob could walk away or significantly lower his offer. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids potential future complications."
