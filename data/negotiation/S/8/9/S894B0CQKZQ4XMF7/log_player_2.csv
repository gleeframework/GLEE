Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and it's a reasonable price compared to your $120 alternative. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiations falling through and having to buy from John."
