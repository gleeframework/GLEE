{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting the offer lets you try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price closer to my maximum. This will give me more room to negotiate in subsequent rounds if needed."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  I'll continue negotiating with her, hoping to get a better deal before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum price. If Alice accepts, I get the product at my limit. If she rejects, I'll have to decide between accepting John's offer or continuing to negotiate with Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm at a point where it's likely I'll end up paying more than John's offer, which is guaranteed. Therefore, I'll buy from John to ensure I get the product at the best possible price within my budget."
