"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $1800000 is higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it, considering its potential value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $1600000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Considering the potential value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1450000.  This price reflects my budget constraints, but also shows my genuine interest in acquiring this unique item.  I'm eager to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
