"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a decent price, he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's a chance Alice will come down in price to secure a sale, or Bob can always opt to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay less, $9,000 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $8,000. It's also likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a significant price drop."
