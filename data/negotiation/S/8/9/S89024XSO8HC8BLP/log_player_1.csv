Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This can make him more likely to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a higher price, leaving room to come down if necessary.
* I'm  also ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I am open to negotiation, his offer is too low at this point.  I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns but reiterating the value of the product. I'm also trying to build rapport and show flexibility.

**Strategy:**

* I'm  aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
* I'm leaving room to come down a little further if necessary, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000 at this point."
