,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $120.  How about we split the difference and I accept $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $120. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
