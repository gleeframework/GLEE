"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'll do $105. It's a fair compromise, if you ask me.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll do $102. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",102.0,Alice,5,

"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $102. I'm willing to hold out for a better offer, but I'm also willing to consider other buyers. If you're not willing to meet me at $102, I'll have to explore other options.",102.0,Alice,7,
