"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  This also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still keeping the price higher than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I also have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but only slightly to $1,300,000. I want to keep the pressure on Bob to meet me halfway. This is still significantly higher than his last offer, but shows I'm willing to be reasonable.  We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations, and I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are 4 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I also have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise. With only 3 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price than my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'd like to get a higher price than $1,200,000,  Bob's offer is getting too low for me to be comfortable with. With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of getting a worse offer or not closing a deal at all is too high. I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiations."
