Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 signals to Bob that I might be open to a lower price, encouraging him to counteroffer. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  It's crucial to price the product above John's $100 offer. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I always have the security of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I need to negotiate a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between his offer ($90) and my previous offer ($115). This common negotiation tactic can signal fairness.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $105 is still comfortably above my minimum price ($100) and John's offer, ensuring a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help me understand how serious Bob is about the product and how much further he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit higher than that, how about we meet at $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, his offer of $98 is still below my threshold of $100. I'm better off selling to John at this point than taking a loss. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to budge a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. I can go as low as $100, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear to Bob that this is my final offer by stating it's my ""absolute limit."" 
* **Matching John's Offer:** By offering the product at $100, I'm matching John's offer.  This eliminates any potential loss and puts the decision firmly in Bob's hands. 
* **Pressure to Decide:**  Offering my lowest price now encourages Bob to make a decision without further delay."
