"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to agree to $9,000. Could we perhaps aim for $8,500? This would allow us to stay close to my budget while still providing you with a good return.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I'm still not quite there with your offer. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair compromise, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  I understand this is still a bit higher than you'd prefer, but I believe this product is worth it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could we possibly settle on $9,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to stay within my financial limits while still being beneficial for you.",9000.0,Bob,6,
