{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure it would be valuable to you! I'm offering it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum desired price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, suggesting I'm open to discussing the price further. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,000 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **John's offer is a better option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price, making it more beneficial to reject Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while counter-offering with a price that's a compromise between our positions.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  $9,000 allows for potential further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlight Benefits:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" Bob would get at $9,000, making it appealing to him. 
* **Maintain Value:** $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, keeping my profit closer to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to agree to $9,000. Could we perhaps aim for $8,500? This would allow us to stay close to my budget while still providing you with a good return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000.
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum, which is more beneficial than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Further negotiation unlikely:**  Bob has already shown he's unwilling to go above $8,500, making further negotiation unlikely to result in a significantly higher price.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and sell to John, as it ensures a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but I'm still not quite there with your offer. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle on $9,500? This would be a fair compromise, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  I understand this is still a bit higher than you'd prefer, but I believe this product is worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm framing this as my last offer to show I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Compromise Focus:** I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Closing Pressure:** This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency, potentially making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Still above minimum:** $9,500 is still above my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer, making it a potentially acceptable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could we possibly settle on $9,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to stay within my financial limits while still being beneficial for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to my previous counteroffer, suggesting there's little room for further negotiation to reach a price significantly higher than that.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired price and a higher profit than what Bob is offering.
* **Risk of going lower:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could result in a lower price, potentially below my minimum desired price.

Given the guaranteed higher profit with John, it's more advantageous to end the negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
