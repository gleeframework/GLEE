"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice,  $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I can go down a little bit, but $105 is just too low for me. How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $109? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
