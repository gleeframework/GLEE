"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a better deal or can always fall back on buying from John."
