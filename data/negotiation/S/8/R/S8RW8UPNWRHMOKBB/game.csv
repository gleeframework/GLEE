"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,750? I really want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $10,900.  This is a very fair price, and I think it's a good compromise.  What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. How about $10,700? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to save as much as I can.",10700.0,Bob,6,
