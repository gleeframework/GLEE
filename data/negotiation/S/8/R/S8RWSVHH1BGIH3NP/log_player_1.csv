"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the product's value to Bob. This helps build rapport and makes him more likely to engage. 
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, so accepting his offer is not an option.
* **Selling to John is too risky:**  While I could sell to John for $100, I might be able to get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.
* **Continuing the negotiation is the best option:** I have room to negotiate downward from my initial offer of $110. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm staying positive and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Strategic price:** $98 is a good compromise. It's close enough to Bob's offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but it still ensures I'm making a profit."
