{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price of $15,000, significantly higher than my minimum. This is a common tactic to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to potentially entice Bob into accepting.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my assessment of his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can only afford to pay $12000 for it at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of driving him away isn't worth the potential gain.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
