Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice $1,200,000.  Therefore, Alice should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** While Alice could start high (e.g., $1,190,000), it risks Bob outright rejecting the offer.  A price of $1,150,000:
    * Offers Bob a significant saving ($50,000 less than its worth to him).
    * Earns Alice a substantial profit above her minimum.
* **Framing the Offer:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob while positioning the price as a special opportunity. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
