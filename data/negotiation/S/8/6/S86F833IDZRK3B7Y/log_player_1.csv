"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I want to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open ended question:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I encourage Bob to respond and open the dialogue. 

This strategy gives me a good starting point and allows me to see how Bob reacts before deciding whether to move closer to his perceived value or stick to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for further negotiation as we have 9 rounds left. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Sell to John is always an option:** While I'm pursuing a better deal with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150. This gives me leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us, which can be more persuasive than just sticking to my own demands.
* **Open ended question:**  Again, I encourage Bob to respond and continue the dialogue.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Continuing negotiation:**  We still have several rounds left, so there's time for further negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Sell to John is always a backup:** While I'm pursuing a better deal with Bob, the option to sell to John for $150 gives me leverage.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $105 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and highlighting its potential to lead to a deal.
* **Open ended question:**  I'm encouraging Bob to respond and keep the dialogue open.

This strategy aims to find a compromise that's more palatable to both of us, while still ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price. It also emphasizes the benefits of reaching an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $102.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are already at round 6, and we have only 4 rounds left.  
* **No significant progress:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, we're still quite far apart. It's unlikely I can reach my minimum acceptable price with the remaining time.
* **Selling to John is a better option:** With John, I'm guaranteed $150, which is significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob.

Considering the limited time and the diminishing possibility of getting a better price from Bob, it's more advantageous to sell to John at this point."
