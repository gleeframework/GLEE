"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make you a deal. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is a steal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you say? Are you ready to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer of $750,000 is less than your maximum budget of $800,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $800,000."
