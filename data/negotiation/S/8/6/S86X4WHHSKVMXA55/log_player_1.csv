Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I'd get my minimum price from John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting high but below my minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
