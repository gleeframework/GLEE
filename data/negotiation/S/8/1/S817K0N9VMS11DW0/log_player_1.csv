Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $800,000, as that's what I'd get from John.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Offer:**  I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount for Bob, potentially enticing him to accept.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves $200,000 in potential profit for me, and $200,000 in potential savings for Bob compared to his perceived value.  

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob a compelling reason to accept the offer."
