{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong offer that still provides a significant gain for Alice. It positions the price well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation while still being enticing enough for Bob to consider seriously.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning other interested parties and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
