Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 (because John guarantees that price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's value. This means getting Bob to buy requires creativity.

**The Strategy**

Since a price within the ZOPA isn't possible, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob the product is worth more:**  This is difficult but could involve highlighting features or benefits Bob might not be considering. 
2. **Anchor Bob at a higher price:** Even if he rejects your initial offer, it sets a reference point. He might be more open to a slightly lower counteroffer than if you started low.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more in the long run.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1800000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but not outrageous:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and your minimum. This might seem risky, but it aims to anchor his thinking.
* **Focus on value, not just price:** The message emphasizes the product's potential, subtly suggesting it's worth more than Bob thinks.
* **Open to discussion:**  The language keeps the door open for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gauge his seriousness and decide whether to move closer to your minimum or walk away (knowing you have John as a backup)."
