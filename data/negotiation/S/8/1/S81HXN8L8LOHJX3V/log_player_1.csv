"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm giving Bob a chance to counteroffer, which will help determine his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While selling to John for $120 is an option, I'm not desperate yet.  I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $125 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit.
* **Reasoning provided:** My message explains the counteroffer and emphasizes fairness, making it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further upside:**  I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.
* **Selling to John is equivalent:**  Selling to John would yield the same amount, but I've already invested time in negotiating with Bob."
