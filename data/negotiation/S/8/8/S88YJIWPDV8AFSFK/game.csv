"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 undervalues the product's unique features and potential. I could consider a price of $1,075,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my absolute minimum.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000 - this is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my strong desire to see this deal go through.  I believe this is more than fair and allows us both to benefit.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",980000.0,Bob,6,
