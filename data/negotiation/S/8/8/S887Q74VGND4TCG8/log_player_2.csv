{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're looking for a product worth no more than $8,000 to you. Alice's offer of $9,500 is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $7,500 as a counteroffer. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. My goal is to get as close to my maximum price of $8,000 as possible."

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above my maximum price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $8,000 as a counteroffer. This is my maximum price and hopefully, Alice will accept.  If she rejects, I'll purchase the product from John for the same price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,100 is still higher than my maximum price of $8,000.  Since I can buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John."
