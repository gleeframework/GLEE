"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $825,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $775,000? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product a valuable asset. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.",800000.0,Alice,5,
