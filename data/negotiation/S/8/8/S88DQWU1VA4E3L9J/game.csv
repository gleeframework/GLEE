"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000? This reflects the product's value while offering you a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still quite low for what I'm offering.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
