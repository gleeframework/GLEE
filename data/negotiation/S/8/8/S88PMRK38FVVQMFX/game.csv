"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I can offer you a slight compromise at $9,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product to me.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $8,500. I think I can do better than that. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to consider it.",9000.0,Alice,7,
