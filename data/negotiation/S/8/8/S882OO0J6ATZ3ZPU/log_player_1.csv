Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open Ended:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to open the door for negotiation and see if he's interested. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $85 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Counter-Offer:**  I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $85 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm rephrasing the counteroffer as finding a price that ""works for both of us"", emphasizing a win-win outcome.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a brief explanation for my counteroffer to make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Open-Ended:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts again, inviting him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $100, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $88.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Upside:**  I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob's offers are getting closer to his own valuation. Further negotiation may not yield much more money.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
