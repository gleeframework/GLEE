"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
