"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $800,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $800,000 to $750,000. This is a significant move, and it's likely that further negotiation might only result in small savings.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving $250,000 compared to buying from John is the most sensible choice."
