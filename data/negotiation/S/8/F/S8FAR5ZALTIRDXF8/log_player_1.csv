Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I still feel like I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer once more and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

```

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  I've already made significant concessions and feel like I'm close to my desired price. However, with only a few rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can close the deal with Bob at a price that fully satisfies me. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's more prudent to sell to John and avoid further negotiation."
