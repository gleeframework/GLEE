"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,050,000.  I understand your position, but I'm confident the product's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal on a valuable asset.  Let's make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
