Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,050,000.  I understand your position, but I'm confident the product's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal on a valuable asset.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already made a significant concession. While $1,050,000 is more than selling to John, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile for me. I've also only got 6 rounds remaining, and further negotiations may not yield a better outcome.  It's time to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
