"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,050,000.  I understand your position, but I'm confident the product's worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal on a valuable asset.  Let's make this work!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
