"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $6,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",7200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,900. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",6900.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer it to you for $6,750. This is my final offer.",6750.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $6,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, just like you suggested earlier, and I'll pay $6,500 for the product. This is my final offer.",6500.0,Bob,10,
