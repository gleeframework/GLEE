"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth may vary depending on your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $120. I believe this price reflects its quality and the opportunity it presents. Let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the maximum value of the product for Bob is $120, and John is offering the product for $120, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice.  Bob can simply buy the product from John and avoid any potential risk of a prolonged negotiation or a higher price."
