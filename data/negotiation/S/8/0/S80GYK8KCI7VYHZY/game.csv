"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $750,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",815000.0,Alice,5,
