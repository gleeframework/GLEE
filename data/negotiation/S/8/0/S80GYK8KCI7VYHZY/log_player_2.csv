"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget.** You're aiming for a price under $800,000. 
* **There's potential to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into accepting a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $750,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.**  You want to get it for under $800,000.
* **You have remaining rounds and a backup option.** You can keep negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price, and you can always go with John if you don't reach a satisfactory deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.** You want to get it for under $800,000.
* **You are running out of time.**  You have 5 rounds left. 
* **John is offering a better deal.**  You can buy the product from John for $800,000, which is below your budget and saves you time and negotiation effort.

At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice risks going over your budget or running out of rounds without securing a deal. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient way to get the product within your financial limits."
