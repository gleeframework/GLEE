"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows for a potential better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm confident that this product will bring you a significant return on investment, so I'm willing to make a compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still a gap.  Bob can continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal. He can reject the offer and make another counteroffer.  There's still potential to get the price down further.  While John's offer is tempting, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and the negotiation with Alice shows promise."
