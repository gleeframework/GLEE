"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $10,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $10,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $10,500 is still quite low for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. ",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
