I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can get a better offer from Bob."

Round 6

Although I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price from Bob, I'm running out of time and rounds.  At this point, it's wiser to sell to John for $10,000.  This guarantees I don't lose out entirely and ensures I'm not stuck with the product."
