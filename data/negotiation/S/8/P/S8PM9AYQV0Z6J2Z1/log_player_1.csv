I'm starting with an offer of $13,000.  This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $12,000.  I'm optimistic that we can negotiate a fair price without having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product for less than my minimum price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise that still gives me a profit margin while being closer to Bob's offer. I'm hopeful that this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally come around to my minimum price of $12,000.  Since John is also offering the same amount, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. There's no reason to continue negotiating for a higher price when I'm already at my desired minimum."
