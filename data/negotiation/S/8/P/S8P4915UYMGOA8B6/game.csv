"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
