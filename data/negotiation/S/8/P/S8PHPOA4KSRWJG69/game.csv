"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
