Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a very reasonable price."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than our guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations.  More information about Bob could lead to a more tailored (and potentially even more profitable) approach."
