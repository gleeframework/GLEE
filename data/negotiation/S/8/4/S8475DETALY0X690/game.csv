"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $1,075,000 is still a little low for me. How about we settle on $1,125,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to do $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll gain from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
