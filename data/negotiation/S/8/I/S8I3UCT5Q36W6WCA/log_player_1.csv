Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential $300,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but not so high that Bob walks away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not starting at your minimum, showing you value the product.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing all details, hinting at ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" reinforces the price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a win-win within the $1,400,000 - $1,500,000 range.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to:

* **Accept outright:**  Great outcome!
* **Counter-offer:** Be ready to negotiate further, strategically moving towards your minimum if needed.
* **Reject:**  You have your backup offer from John."
