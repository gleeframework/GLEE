I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation.  I'm confident he'll want to buy the product, and this gives me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept and get something, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm meeting Bob halfway with my counteroffer.  This should be attractive enough to get him to agree, but still gives me a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I'm happy to take John's offer and secure a sale at my desired price."
