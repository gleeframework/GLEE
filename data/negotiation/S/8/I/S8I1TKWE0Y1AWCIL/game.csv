"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $200 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $80 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  This product is high-quality and I'm confident it would bring you a lot of value. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for your product, but $140 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
