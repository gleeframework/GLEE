Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  He has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This keeps the negotiation open and allows for potential flexibility on both sides."
