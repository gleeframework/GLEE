Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob has shown some willingness to come up in price, he's still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a solid deal, and I don't want to risk losing that.  I'm going to close the deal with John and move on."
