"Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that could be extremely valuable for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant price, but I believe the potential return will far outweigh the investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a significant concession on my initial price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1300000. This is a final concession on my part. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I will need to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
