"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  To be frank, $1,050,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $1,075,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering the value it offers and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer, and I need a decision soon.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
