"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can close the deal with John immediately."
