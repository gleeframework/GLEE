"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We want to start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This allows room for negotiation while staying well below our $80 maximum. By offering $60, we signal that we're serious but looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $90, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above our $80 limit. We'll reject and counter-offer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're splitting the difference between her offer of $90 and our previous offer of $60. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within our budget.  We also frame it as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85. While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of exceeding our $80 budget. Buying from John guarantees us the product at the best possible price."
