"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my own value for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that you're willing to pay $850,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
