This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Saving:** You're getting the product for $1,800 less than John's price.
* **Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield smaller concessions, making the risk outweigh the potential reward."
