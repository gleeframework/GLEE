Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, it's still below my minimum price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too far below what I need.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.
