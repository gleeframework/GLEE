"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a great value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $975,000 is still too far below what I need.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's value to you and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can close this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
