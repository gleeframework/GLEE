"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is still above Alice's likely minimum price of $8,000 but significantly lower than her initial offer of $12,000.  This leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good price, considering my maximum budget is $15,000.  It's also a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer, and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best option at this stage."
