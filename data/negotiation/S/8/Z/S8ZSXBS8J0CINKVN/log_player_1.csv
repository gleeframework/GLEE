"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for potential concessions while still aiming for a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $130 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150.  While I could accept it and get something, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $95? That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still above my budget.  Would you consider $98? That's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  With only a few rounds remaining, I don't have time to continue negotiating, and John is offering a much better price. I'll sell the product to John."
