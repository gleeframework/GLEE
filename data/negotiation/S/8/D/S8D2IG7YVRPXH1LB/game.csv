"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for your consideration. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential value, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than I'm willing to go at this stage.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This would allow us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap a bit further.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
