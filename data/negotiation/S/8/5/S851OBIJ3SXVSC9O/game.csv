"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is too low for me.  This product is truly worth the value, and I could easily sell it for $10,000 to someone else.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $11,750 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I need to be fair to myself as well. $10,500 is my final offer, and I believe it's a very reasonable price for this product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer, $10,000 is my absolute limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. Please consider it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
