"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his budget might be. If he rejects, I can always adjust my price down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round.  I need to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round.  It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure with the rounds dwindling, but I'm not giving up yet.  This is still a reasonable compromise and close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds, but $14,000 isn't quite enough for me to sell. I'll try one more counteroffer.  If it doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he doesn't.  I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
