Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and I'm hoping this price feels fair. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be even more valuable.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to Bob, the message hints at understanding its value, making the higher price more palatable.
* **Alternative:** Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can always negotiate down towards her minimum of $8,000."
