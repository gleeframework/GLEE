Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Perceived Value:** By emphasizing the ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment,"" the aim is to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you're guaranteed to sell the product at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You may need to adjust your price depending on his response and how much you believe he's willing to pay."
