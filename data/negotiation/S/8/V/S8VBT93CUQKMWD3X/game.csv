"While I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
