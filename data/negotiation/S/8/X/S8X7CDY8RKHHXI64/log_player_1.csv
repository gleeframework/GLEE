Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This is a starting point for the negotiation.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation without making me seem unreasonable.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows I'm confident in the product's worth and sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation. 

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll try to bridge the gap a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still showing flexibility. By offering a ""final offer,"" I'm putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,360,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,360,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's a bit of a gamble, but I believe Bob might be willing to go a little higher if I reject his offer, but I'd rather have the certainty of this sale."
