"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. This item holds significant worth to me, but I believe its true value lies in the hands of someone who can appreciate it fully. Considering its uniqueness and rarity, I am offering it to you for $15000. If this proposal aligns with your interests and budget, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. Should you decide against it, rest assured, there's an alternative option waiting for us, as my colleague John is also interested in acquiring the product for $10000. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
