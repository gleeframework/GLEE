Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob has stated this is his ""best and final offer"". Accepting $950,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away. Continuing negotiations might lead to a stalemate or even lower offers."
