Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's in my best interest to cut my losses and sell to John, securing my minimum desired profit."
