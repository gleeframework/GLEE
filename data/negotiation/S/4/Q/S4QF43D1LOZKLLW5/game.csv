"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,5,
