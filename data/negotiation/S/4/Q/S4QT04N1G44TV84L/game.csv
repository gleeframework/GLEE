"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price considering your potential gains. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away with a reasonable outcome. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
