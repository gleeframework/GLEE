{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below your minimum threshold. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd be happy to pay $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum threshold of $120.  While I could accept his offer, I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer though. How about $110? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure if I can get him to budge higher. It's not worth risking a lower price for the sake of a few more rounds of negotiation. John is a guaranteed $120, so I'll sell to him."
