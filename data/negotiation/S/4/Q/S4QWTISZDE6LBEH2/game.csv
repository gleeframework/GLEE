"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd be happy to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer though. How about $110? That gives us both a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really keen on this product, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
