"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  You could potentially get a better deal from Alice, or if not, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and signals my intention to purchase but at a price that's more favorable to me. This counteroffer allows room for potential compromise and could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than John's offer of $1,000,000. Considering the potential for further negotiation, this is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure the product now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more or losing the product altogether."
