Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us. I'm hoping to get a little extra for the product, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a good deal, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."
