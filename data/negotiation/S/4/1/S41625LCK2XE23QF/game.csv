"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to gain some profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable offer. This is still a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for significantly less than its true value. If you're serious about acquiring this product, this is your chance to make it happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
