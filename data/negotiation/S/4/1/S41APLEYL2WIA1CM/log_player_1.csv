"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to try and justify my initial price.

**Note:** I am aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, but I'm trying to maximize my profit. The risk is that Bob might reject the offer and I might have to settle for the $1,000,000 from John. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal by negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still below what I'd like to get.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John now guarantees me $1,000,000.  However, I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and potentially getting a better deal.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's, aiming to find a compromise in the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000,  showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and conciliatory tone to encourage Bob to accept.

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess the situation. If his next counteroffer is significantly lower, I might be better off selling to John to guarantee a profit. However, if the offer is closer to my desired price, I'll continue to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** We're getting closer, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Avoiding guaranteed loss:** Selling to John now would guarantee me $1,000,000. However, I'm not willing to settle for that yet, as I'm hoping to reach a deal closer to $1,100,000 with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, perhaps $1,050,000. This will show I'm serious about making a deal, but I'll still try to hold out for a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum for this product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm stating my absolute minimum price, making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower. However, I'm still framing it as a fair and worthwhile investment for Bob.
* **Focus on the value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my stance.
* **Setting a deadline:** By stating my minimum price, I'm subtly putting some pressure on Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000.  However, if Bob makes a counteroffer close to that amount, I might be willing to negotiate slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to make a bit more room for other expenses. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Bob's offer is only $20,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While tempting, it's not a significant enough difference to justify further negotiation.
* **Time is running out:**  We're already in round 6, and I'm running out of time to get a better deal.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a safe and sure bet to avoid the risk of a further negotiation breakdown.

**Conclusion:**

While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,200,000, the reality is that I need to secure a deal quickly to avoid losing out. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and provides a secure and timely outcome."
