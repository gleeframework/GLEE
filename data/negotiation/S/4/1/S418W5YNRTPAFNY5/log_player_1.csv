"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,550,000 is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

We're still significantly above John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,600,000? This would be a strong reflection of the product's value while still being a good deal for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a good deal, but he's still offering a price significantly higher than John's. Accepting $1,580,000 gives us a great profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
