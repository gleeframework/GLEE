"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price point. Would you be willing to consider $1,650,000? This accounts for the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,550,000 is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Can we discuss this further?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $1,600,000? This would be a strong reflection of the product's value while still being a good deal for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,580,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at this price?",1580000.0,Bob,6,
