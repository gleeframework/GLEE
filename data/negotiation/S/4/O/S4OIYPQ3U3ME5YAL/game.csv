"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above my maximum value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
