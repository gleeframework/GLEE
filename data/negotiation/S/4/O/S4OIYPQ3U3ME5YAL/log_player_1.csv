Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above my maximum value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.
