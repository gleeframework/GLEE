"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $800,000. While the product is potentially valuable, it's not worth exceeding your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above my maximum value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great value. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above your budget. Even though she's willing to meet you ""halfway,"" the price is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000, as this is within your budget and guarantees you the product."
