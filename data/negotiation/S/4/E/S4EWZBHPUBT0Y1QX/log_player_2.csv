"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1120000.
