Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your ceiling is $800,000, and I'm willing to get closer to that number. However, I'm not willing to sacrifice too much profit.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $810,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $812,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but in smaller increments.  While we could hold out hope for a slightly better price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting at $812,500 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's fallback option."
