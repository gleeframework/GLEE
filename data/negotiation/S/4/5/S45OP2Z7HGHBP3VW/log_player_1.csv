Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant value at this price, considering what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price that Bob might be willing to pay, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to him.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to respond. I also highlight the value of the product without being overly pushy.

**Strategy:** 

This approach aims to:

* **Get the ball rolling:**  I'm presenting a compelling offer that makes Bob think. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's enough wiggle room to potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects my offer, I have the option of counter-offering or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to you and what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close the deal, I can't afford to take such a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to counter-offer shows he's interested. There's still potential to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a more balanced compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $1,300,000?  This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm increasing the price from Bob's offer to $1,300,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my position clearly and emphasizing the value the product still holds for Bob. This helps keep the negotiation open and respectful.
* **Open-ended message:** I'm ending with a question that invites Bob to respond, encouraging further dialogue.

**Strategy:**

By making a counter-offer, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise while staying firm on my bottom line. This strategy aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's price, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's initial low offer, but I'm also not rejecting him outright, keeping the negotiation alive.
* **Set the stage for a final agreement:** The counteroffer allows for a possible final agreement without having to make drastic concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'm aiming for.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further rounds of negotiation could lead to more time wasted and potentially lower prices.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John provides me with a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than what I'm likely to get from Bob.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's more advantageous for me to secure a sure deal with John than to continue negotiating with Bob. The risk of further negotiation with Bob is too high, as he might not be willing to budge further.  Selling to John allows me to meet my minimum price goal and avoid further potential losses."
