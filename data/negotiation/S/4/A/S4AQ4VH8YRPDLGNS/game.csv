"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet at $105? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. How about we meet at $115? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $115, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $112, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112 and my original price of $120. How about we meet at $116? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise for both of us.",116.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $114, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John.",114.0,Bob,8,
