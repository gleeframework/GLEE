"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is decent, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price in a counter-offer."
