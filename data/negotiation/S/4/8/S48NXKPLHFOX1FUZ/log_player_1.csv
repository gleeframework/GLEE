Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but there's room to negotiate down since John provides a guaranteed sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 allows for some back and forth with Bob.  He might try to negotiate a lower price, and you can potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to sound somewhat flexible.  If Bob is very enthusiastic, you might hold firm on the $9,500. If he's hesitant, you can imply willingness to go slightly lower.

**Important:** This assumes Alice doesn't know how much Bob values the product at. If Alice knew Bob's valuation was $8,000, she'd likely start negotiations higher."
