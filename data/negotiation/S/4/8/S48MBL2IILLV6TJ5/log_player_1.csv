{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my offer to Bob. I am pricing the product at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed sale price of $1,200,000 with John. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

If Bob accepts, I earn an extra $300,000. If he rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000. 

This strategy balances the potential for higher profit with the risk of losing a sale, and allows me to gauge Bob's perceived value of the product."
