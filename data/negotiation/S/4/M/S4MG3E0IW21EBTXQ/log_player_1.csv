Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and even lower than my minimum. It's too low to accept. I will counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $10,000, and while it's closer to my minimum, I'm not eager to settle for such a low price. I'll counteroffer again, but if this round doesn't work, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm not going any lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's clear that Bob is a tough negotiator, and I'm not sure he's willing to pay any more. I'm not willing to continue this negotiation any further.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I'm ready to move on."
