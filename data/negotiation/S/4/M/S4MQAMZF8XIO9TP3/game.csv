"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $1,050,000 for this product. Given its value to me, I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is the highest I can go while still making this purchase worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
