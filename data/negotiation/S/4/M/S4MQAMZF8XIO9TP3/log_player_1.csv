Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $1,050,000 for this product. Given its value to me, I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is the highest I can go while still making this purchase worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Bob seems firmly set at $1,050,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive the full value of the product."
