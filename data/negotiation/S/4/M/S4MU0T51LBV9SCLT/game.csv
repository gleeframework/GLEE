"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a generous compromise, considering the product's unique features and my initial offer of $1100000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
