"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $850,000.  This price reflects its value to me while giving you a good return. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
