Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a good starting point for us to negotiate from. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your firm limit, but I need to be honest,  $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I can do $800,000, which is my final offer.  I think it's a fair price considering John is willing to sell it at that price right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has hit his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get him significantly higher, especially since he knows John's offer. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds failing."
