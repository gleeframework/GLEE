{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's room to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It's significantly higher than his perceived value but might be tempting if he highly values a quick purchase or your unique ownership.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** If Bob declines, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to avoid discouraging him completely. 
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is scarce or highly sought-after, a higher price might be justified."
