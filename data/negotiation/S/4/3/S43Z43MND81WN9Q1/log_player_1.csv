"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm offering it at a very reasonable price of $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Being Friendly:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price is high enough to give Bob a reason to counteroffer, but not so high that it seems unreasonable from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I still want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher:**  It's possible Bob is willing to pay a bit more. By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true interest and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price but still leaving room for a potential profit. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing fairness and giving Bob a reason to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $90, I'm gauging Bob's willingness to pay closer to my initial price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'll take it under consideration. Would you be open to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Time:**  We're already on round 4, and time is running out. 
* **Potential for Better Deals:** While I would love to get closer to $90, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale that is only slightly less than my minimum.
* **Risk of John:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing out on the sale to John, who is willing to pay my minimum. 

I'm taking the safe option and accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
