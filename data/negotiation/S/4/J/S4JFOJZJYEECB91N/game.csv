,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both, the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise demonstrates a serious interest in this product, and I want to find a solution that benefits us both.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value of what this product can do for your business while still being a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that we can both benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
