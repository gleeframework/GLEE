"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I believe this price reflects its significant worth."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and still potentially land within a range exceeding John's offer. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point.  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, his counteroffer might be influenced by the higher starting point.
* **Confident Demeanor:**  The message framing emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive.  This portrays confidence in the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  The initial offer is significantly higher, so Bob's reaction will be telling.
* **Negotiation Style:**  The first round will give us insight into Bob's negotiation style. Is he likely to make a low counteroffer, or does he tend to negotiate more incrementally? 
* **John's Offer:** We always have the safety net of John's $1,500,000 offer. It's crucial to weigh each round against this guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is already above his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:**  While closer to John's offer, we still have time to potentially secure a better deal from Bob.
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:**  Rejecting this offer allows us to counter-propose in a way that guides the negotiation toward a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for us both, the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Decrease:** We want to signal flexibility while maintaining a strong position. Dropping by $300,000 is a substantial move that shows willingness to negotiate, but keeps us significantly above both Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. 
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value without directly dismissing Bob's perspective.  The goal is to keep the tone collaborative while advocating for a higher price. 

**Considerations for Future Rounds:**

* **Bob's Response:** Bob's counter-offer will reveal how much he's willing to move. If his next offer is still too low, we might consider smaller decrements in future rounds.
* **Time Remaining:** We have seven rounds left. It's still early in the negotiation, but we should be mindful of the remaining time and the potential need to move more aggressively if a deal seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value of the product, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, as evidenced by his $200,000 increase from his previous offer. 
* **Still Below Target:**  While $1,300,000 is getting closer to John's offer, we are aiming to maximize profit and believe a better deal is still possible.
* **Time for a Counter:** Rejecting this offer allows us to counter-propose in a way that encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range. 

**Strategy for Next Round:**

* **Smaller Concessions:** Since Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, we can likely reduce the size of our counter-offers to encourage him upwards.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** In our next message, it might be beneficial to highlight the value this product brings to Bob, further justifying a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise demonstrates a serious interest in this product, and I want to find a solution that benefits us both.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point reflects the true value of what this product can do for your business while still being a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reduced Concession:**  We're lowering our asking price by $150,000, a smaller decrement than the previous round. This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line while still encouraging Bob to move upward.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the mutual benefit and the potential return on investment for Bob's business. This reinforces the product's value proposition.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still comfortably above John's offer, giving us some room to negotiate further if needed. 

**Looking Ahead:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  His next counter will be critical. If he doesn't make a significant move upward, we'll need to consider whether accepting a price closer to $1,500,000 is preferable to risking a no-deal scenario.
* **Time Factor:**  With five rounds left, we're approaching the halfway point.  We may need to start considering larger concessions in later rounds if we want to avoid going back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute limit.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that we can both benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before I explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeding John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above John's guaranteed $1,500,000. Our primary goal is to maximize profit.
* **Strong Position:** While we could potentially push for more, Bob has indicated this is his ""absolute limit"" and he's exploring other options. This suggests we are unlikely to extract much more value from him.
* **Time Considerations:**  We have four rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal with Bob. Accepting now secures a profit above our alternative and avoids the risk of a stalemate."
