Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate and can confidently aim high.
* **Respect Bob's Valuation:**  While I want to maximize profit, I also want to propose a price that Bob, knowing the product's value to him, would consider reasonable."
