"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and providing your perspective on the value.  While I understand your perspective on the market value, I believe the intrinsic value of this product is much higher, particularly for someone like you who can maximize its potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe in the intrinsic value of the product, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the price you're quoting. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. Can we discuss further?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
