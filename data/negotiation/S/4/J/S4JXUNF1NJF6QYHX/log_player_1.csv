Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

Offering the product at $115 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value for Bob while still staying above your minimum.  Bob is likely to accept this offer since it saves him $5 compared to his perceived value."
