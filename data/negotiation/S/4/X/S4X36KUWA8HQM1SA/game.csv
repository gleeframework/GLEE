"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to me, but knowing its potential value to you, I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  It seems we both see the inherent value in this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,4,
