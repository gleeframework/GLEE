"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below the product's worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range.  There are still rounds left and I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to recover a portion of the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider a reasonable compromise. I believe there's room for further negotiation, particularly since Bob is clearly interested and we have more rounds remaining.  Selling to John now would secure a much higher price, but I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $10,250 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet at $10,400? This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,400. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but no higher. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered $10,300, which is only $100 less than my last offer. While it's still below my ideal price, we're nearing a deal, and I'm worried that if I reject his offer again, I might push him away.  Since we have limited rounds remaining, I'd rather secure a sale at this price than risk a stalemate and having to sell to John for a much lower profit margin."
