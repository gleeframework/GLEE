"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a real asset to your business. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I agree it's a valuable product, I have a strict budget for this purchase. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, and I want to work with you. However, $7,500 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we compromise at $8,500? This price reflects the value of the product and would allow you to see a strong return on your investment.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
