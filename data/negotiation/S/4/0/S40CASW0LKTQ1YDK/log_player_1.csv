Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 given its potential worth.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($1,200,000 - $800,000 = $400,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still ensuring a substantial profit for you.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
