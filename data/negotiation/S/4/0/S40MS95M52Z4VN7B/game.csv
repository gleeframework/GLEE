"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $9500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'd like to propose $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer it to you for $9250. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final offer of $8500. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can agree on this price.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll make one more offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'll offer it to you for $9750. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but I'm still not willing to pay $9750. I'm making a firm offer of $8500, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",8500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $9000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $9000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're still not interested, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling to John for $8000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,9,
