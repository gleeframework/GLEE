Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my budget, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going with John."

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, but it's still lower than Alice's offer. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate, while still staying within my budget."
