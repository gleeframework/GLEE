Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable enough to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer of $85 is a reasonable compromise. It's higher than his initial offer and gets me closer to my goal.  Selling to John would guarantee $100, but I'm willing to take the risk of a slightly lower price for a quicker sale."
