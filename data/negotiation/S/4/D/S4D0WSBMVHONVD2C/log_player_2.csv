"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's important to start the negotiation by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000, as that's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000, which is a compromise that reflects the value I believe the product holds. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his desired range.  There are still several rounds left to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth another round of counteroffers to see if they can reach a compromise.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower. There are still a few rounds left and a better price might be possible.  However, if the next few rounds don't yield a more favorable price, Bob should consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last push to try to reach a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  With only a few rounds remaining, Bob has reached a point where he needs to decide if he's willing to pay above his limit or secure the product at a lower price from John.  While negotiating further could potentially lower Alice's price, there's no guarantee it will reach his desired range. 

Given that John is offering the product for $800,000, which is well within Bob's budget, it's the most sensible decision to ""BuyFromJhon.""  It secures the product at a price that meets his financial constraints and eliminates the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
