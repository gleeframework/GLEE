"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and my aim is to ensure we find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I propose to offer the product to you at a price of $1,000,000. This price reflects a strategic balance between maximizing the value I receive for the product and ensuring you achieve a substantial return on your investment. I look forward to discussing this proposal further and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and increase the chances of her lowering the price further."
