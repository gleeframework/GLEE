"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is a good compromise.  It's still lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's closer to Bob's target price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
