Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and leaves Bob with the impression that you might be willing to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the offer ""reflects its worth,"" I am subtly implying that the product has value beyond even this offered price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Important Considerations:**

*  **Bob's Perspective:**  While I know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives its value to be higher or if there are no other readily available alternatives.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing that John will purchase the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. This means I can afford to be a bit more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob."
