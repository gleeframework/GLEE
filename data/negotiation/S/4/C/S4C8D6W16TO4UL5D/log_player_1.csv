{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a better price than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal work for me.  How about $8,750?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,750. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and it still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,600. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,600 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure the sale now."
