"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still ensuring you're above your desired profit margin.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows me (Alice) to gauge Bob's interest and potential price range. His response will give me valuable information to tailor my negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:** I haven't forgotten John! Having a backup offer provides a safety net and influences how low I'm willing to go with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($10,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:**  $12,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about a higher price and encourages Bob to potentially increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly below my asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but staying significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. 
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Compromise:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach can be psychologically appealing and might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Strong Position:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting now secures a good profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob withdrawing or lead to a stalemate. It's often better to secure a good deal than risk losing it."
