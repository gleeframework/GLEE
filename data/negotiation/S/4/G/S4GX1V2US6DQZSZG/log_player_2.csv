# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that holds significant worth for your business. My asking price is $1,000,000, a price I believe reflects its true value. This offer provides you with a considerable advantage, allowing you to secure this asset at a price significantly lower than its potential worth to you. I understand your business acumen, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss further and finalize this transaction.
