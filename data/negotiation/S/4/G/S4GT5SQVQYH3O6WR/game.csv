"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",7500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $7,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit tight for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. Let me know what you think.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $7,250 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land somewhere in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $7,100.  This seems like a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?",7100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",7200.0,Alice,5,
