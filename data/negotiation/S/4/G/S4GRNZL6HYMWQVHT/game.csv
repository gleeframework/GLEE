"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be honest, $10,000 is about as high as I can go. If you are willing to meet at that price I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,7,
