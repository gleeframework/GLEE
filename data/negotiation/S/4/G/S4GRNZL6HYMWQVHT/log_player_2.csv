Round 7
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:

``` 

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to result in significant savings. Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and this price is a reasonable compromise. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at the higher price."
