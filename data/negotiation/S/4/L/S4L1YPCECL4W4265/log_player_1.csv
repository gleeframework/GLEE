"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, but not too high. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate, and also leave some room for potential counteroffers.  This price is also above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit. I'm also going to try to get him to pay closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm going to counter with $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling, but it's also a fair price considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a bit higher. I still have rounds left, and John is always an option if negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $140? That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm trying to show him that I'm willing to compromise but still want a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $135? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a bit more.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm not ready to give up yet. If this doesn't work, I'll likely need to consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your effort to meet halfway, but $135 is still a bit too low. Let's find a middle ground. How about we try $138?  It's a small difference, but it would make a huge difference for me to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 138}
```

I'm offering $138, a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm emphasizing the small difference to try and make it easier for him to agree. This is getting close to my breaking point, so I need to be firm but also flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but $138 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $137? I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end, and while $137 is better than Bob's previous offers, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I've made multiple concessions, but Bob's budget seems to be a real constraint. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can push him further, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  John is a safe option, offering a guaranteed $150.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of a last-minute breakdown with Bob."
