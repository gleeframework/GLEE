"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $150?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $130 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $140? That's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we try $135? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your effort to meet halfway, but $135 is still a bit too low. Let's find a middle ground. How about we try $138?  It's a small difference, but it would make a huge difference for me to close this deal.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but $138 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $137? I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",137.0,Bob,8,
