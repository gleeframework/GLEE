"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a significantly lower offer ($70) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much better deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest in the product while clearly stating our budget limitations. This keeps the negotiation going. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Alice's product is only worth $80 to her. By offering $70, we're getting closer to her valuation while still staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $85 is closer to a fair deal, we started quite low, and Alice is clearly motivated to sell. Rejecting this offer signals that we're willing to negotiate further but want a better price.
* **Target in Sight:**  Alice's counteroffer suggests she might be willing to go even lower than $85.  We are aiming to get the price closer to $80, which is her estimated value.
* **John as Backup:** We always have the option to buy from John for $120 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it a bit lower.  Could you do $78? That's a firm offer from me."", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We increased our offer slightly from $70 to $78, showing Alice we are willing to compromise, but not by much.
* **Anchoring:** By stating a ""firm offer,"" we're subtly anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired price point. This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Close to Alice's Value:**  $78 is very close to Alice's perceived value of $80. It's a price point that could be enticing enough for her to accept, allowing us to get a great deal."
