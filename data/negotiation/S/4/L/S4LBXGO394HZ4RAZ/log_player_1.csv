Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $145 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $145 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $145 is still above your minimum price, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $137.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $137.50 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price of $150.  You're likely to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  

Let's counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $137.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $141.25? That's a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 141.25}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows that you are not willing to sell for his initial offer.
* **It's still within your desired range:** $141.25 is still above your minimum of $150, so you're still making a profit.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It's a ""split the difference"" approach, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $141.25 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $135, which is the lowest I'm comfortable paying. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $135 is still below your minimum of $150.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to take more time and may not result in a higher price.  

John is offering your minimum price, guaranteeing you a good deal.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John!"
