"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to offer $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I'm  firmly at $12000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $11000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
