Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I use positive language (""fantastic product"") to pique Bob's interest.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating. 
* **Counter-Offering:** If Bob's offer is too low, I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000?  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest and a willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's potential for a higher offer.
* **Counter-offering is the best strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counteroffer with a price between Bob's offer ($10,000) and my minimum ($15,000).  I'll need to consider the potential for further negotiation and my willingness to lower the price to secure a sale.
* **Monitor John's offer:**  I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counteroffer of $17,000 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value (""great deal"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer, assessing his willingness to negotiate further.
* **Possible Scenarios:**
    * If Bob accepts my counteroffer, the sale is complete.
    * If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will need to decide whether to lower my price further or revert to John's offer of $15,000.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close, but Not Enough:** While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value.
* **Limited Upside:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating there's little room for further negotiation.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, which is higher than Bob's final offer and closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:**  Selling to John at $15,000 provides a more favorable outcome than accepting Bob's final offer. 
* **End Negotiations with Bob:**  I'll politely decline Bob's final offer and inform him that I've decided to sell the product to another buyer."
