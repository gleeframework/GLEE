"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to bite. This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects. I'm also considering the 10-round limit and John's offer, so I'm not going for the full $12,000 right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I have time and rounds to negotiate, so I'm going to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer, and closer to my desired price point.  I want to keep the negotiations moving and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I have several rounds left and I don't want to settle for a price significantly lower than my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering again with $10,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and I'm worried that if I reject it, I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's also significantly higher than John's offer, making this the best option at this point in the negotiation."
