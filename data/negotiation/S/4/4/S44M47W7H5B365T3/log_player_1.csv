Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on the value the product offers. 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible, while leaving space for counteroffers. I can always go to John for the guaranteed $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob by counteroffering. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,000. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum value. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the value the product provides while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. 

I'm aiming to secure a price that is fair to both of us and keeps me closer to my minimum value. I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob is showing some flexibility, I believe I can still get a better price from him.
* **Selling to John is the fallback:** I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000 if necessary.

I'm going to counteroffer again with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a fair and attractive price. Let's finalize this deal and get you on your way."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product and the significant price reduction to persuade Bob.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

I'm aiming for a win-win situation where Bob gets a good deal, and I reach a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** $10,250 is only $250 away from my minimum value of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my $10,500 counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject him again.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** I can still sell to John for $15,000 if this deal falls through, but that would mean losing out on a potential profit of $4,750. 

Given the potential loss and the close proximity to my minimum, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer."
