{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's a good idea to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and John is a safety net, so there's no rush to accept such a high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price.  This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate. I have plenty of rounds left, and John is always an option if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. I'm still well below her last offer, but I'm getting closer to a price that I'm comfortable with. This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while staying within my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, although she is starting to show willingness to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left.  It's important to stick to my budget and keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer, but this time only by $1,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  However, I'm still keeping my offer below my maximum budget.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's time to start closing the deal, but I want to ensure I get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above my budget.  I have only 4 rounds remaining, but I'm determined to get the price closer to my limit.  John is a reliable option, but I'm not willing to give up on the deal with Alice yet. I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a big jump from my previous offer, but I believe it's necessary to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway.  We only have three rounds left, and I need to close the deal soon.  While this is close to my budget, I believe it's still a fair price, and I'm willing to pay it to secure the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the final round, and Alice's offer is still above my budget, even though it's getting close. It's not worth the risk of losing the deal with John, who's offering a guaranteed price within my budget.  The goal was to save money, and with only one round left, it's time to secure the deal.  John offers a safe and reliable option, allowing me to stick to my budget and get the product I want."
