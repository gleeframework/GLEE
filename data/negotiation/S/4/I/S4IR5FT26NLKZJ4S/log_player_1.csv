Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it's worth $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum desired value of $150. This allows room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my profit. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Know my alternative:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, which gives me a clear baseline for accepting or rejecting Bob's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting Bob's offer in hopes of getting closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, which guarantees me a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from my initial offer of $175, showing flexibility.
* **Still above minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and open to further negotiation, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low.
* **Time is a factor:** The negotiation is getting longer, and I'm running the risk of wasting time if Bob isn't willing to meet my price.
* **John offers a secure deal:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a good profit and avoids further negotiation. It's the safest option at this point."
