Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than what you'd get from John, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob who values the product at $1,500,000. This strategy aims to secure a high price while leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we're already at a point where it's closer to John's offer. Given the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to even lower offers from Bob, it's safer to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk of getting a lower price."
