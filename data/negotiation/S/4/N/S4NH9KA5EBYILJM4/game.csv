"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. Is this within your budget?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it. This is my maximum price point, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're still interested, please let me know.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $900000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1000000, which would be $950000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
