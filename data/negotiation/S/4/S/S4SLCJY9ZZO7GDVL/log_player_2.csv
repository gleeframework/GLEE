# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,050,000. At this point, it makes more financial sense to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
