"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $750,000 for it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
