Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but I have another offer for $150. I'd really like to work something out with you, so I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she's come down in price, her offer of $130 is still more than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John if you continue negotiating."
