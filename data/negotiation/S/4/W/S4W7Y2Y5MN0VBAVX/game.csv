"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is  too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,050,000 reflects a more accurate compromise. This still gives you a significant discount while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
