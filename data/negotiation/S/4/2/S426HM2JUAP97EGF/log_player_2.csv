Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you think $95 is a fair deal, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I need to make it worth my while. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105. While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price and forcing you to accept a higher price in a later round or settle for John's offer anyway. You can get the product for $100 from John, which is your target price."
