,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a good price for both of us, considering the value the product brings to you.",105.0,Alice,5,
