"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently only able to afford $9,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below the minimum value I set for myself ($15,000).  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or have the option of selling to John, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $10,000. This is the highest I can go given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal with Bob or potentially sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad you're willing to compromise. I would like to counter with $10,100. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get $10,250, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer completely. Accepting his offer of $10,100 is the best choice at this point."
