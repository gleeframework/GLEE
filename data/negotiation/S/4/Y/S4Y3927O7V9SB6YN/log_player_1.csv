Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, Alice wants to see if she can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While Alice won't go below $120, starting with a price slightly lower than John's offer might encourage Bob to negotiate upwards.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
