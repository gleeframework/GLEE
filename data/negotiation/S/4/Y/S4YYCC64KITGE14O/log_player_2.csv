"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but you can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're offering, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a much lower price. It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $3,500 compared to buying from John."
