"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you as it's worth $150 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and a great value for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a significant profit for me, and a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for Bob considering the product is worth $150 to him.  While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially having to buy from John at $150 outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
