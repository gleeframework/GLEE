"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and a great value for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm aiming for a higher price than $100, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a significant profit for me, and a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 110}
