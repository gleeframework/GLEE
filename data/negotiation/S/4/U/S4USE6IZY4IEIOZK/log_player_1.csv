Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, and it's a good starting point to see if he's truly interested.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than my absolute minimum, it's still lower than my initial target. I believe I can still push for a higher price, as Bob clearly sees value in the product. I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value I place on the product and Bob's willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to him and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,800 is a decent compromise and only $200 less than my last counteroffer. Accepting this offer is the best choice to maximize my profit, as it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000."
