Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer,  showing flexibility and willingness to find common ground.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm reminding myself that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not pressured into accepting a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.  
* **John's offer is still available:** My backup option is secure, so I can afford to be patient and aim for a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slightly lower price:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my offer from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting the offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not giving in completely, leaving room for potential further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding immediate deal with John:** I'm still aiming for a deal with Bob, which could be more beneficial in the long run if a strong relationship can be established."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,350,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,325,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob risks lowering the price further, potentially resulting in a worse deal.
* **Secure guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

I'm choosing to prioritize my financial goal and accept John's offer.  While I may have been able to negotiate further with Bob, the risk of a lower price and the potential for a long negotiation outweigh the potential benefits."
