{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe it's a valuable investment. My starting price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches the product's value to him, it's the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price, and I have 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered $1,250,000, which is still slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept this offer yet, as I'm hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my initial offer.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,230,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,230,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, the likelihood of getting a better offer from Bob is slim. It's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
