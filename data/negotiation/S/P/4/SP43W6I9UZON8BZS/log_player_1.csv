{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a good price, I can likely do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my target price. While I could potentially get a bit more, there's a risk he could walk away or counter with a lower offer. Accepting his offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
