"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to negotiate. I also emphasize the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for that low yet. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $107.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $109? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll take the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$108 is only slightly below my minimum of $120, but it's still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
