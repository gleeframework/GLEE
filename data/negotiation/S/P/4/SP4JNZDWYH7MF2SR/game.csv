"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $109? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll take the product.",108.0,Bob,6,
