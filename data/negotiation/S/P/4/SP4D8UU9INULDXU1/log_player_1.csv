"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. By offering a ""great deal"" and mentioning its value, you're subtly hinting at the product's worth to Bob without explicitly stating his perceived value. This could encourage him to accept or make a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, we are still in an early stage of negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we can likely get a higher price.  

**Next Steps:** 

We will make a counteroffer that is closer to our desired price of $12,000 but still leaves some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a good offer, we're still within the early stages of negotiation.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and we can likely get closer to our desired price of $11,000.  

**Next Steps:**

We will make a counteroffer that is slightly lower than our previous offer but still leaves some room for further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $10,750? It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible, but it still reflects the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
