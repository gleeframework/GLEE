"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $1,000,000? I understand the value of the product to you, but I am also mindful of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value our potential partnership, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows us to move forward. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a midpoint.  I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  This reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,110,000 isn't quite there yet.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,115,000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing us to finalize this deal.  What are your thoughts?",1115000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating. I'd like to propose a price of $1,112,500. This seems to be a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1112500.0,Bob,8,
