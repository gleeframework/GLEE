"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $100? That would be fair for both of us, and I'm sure you'd still get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.,95.0,Bob,4,
