# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. It's worth at least that much to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for more.  Since John is willing to sell for $12,000, that's the better deal."
