,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, I'm going to need to start lower.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,220,000.",1220000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,220,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,185,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to walk away happy.",1185000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,185,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's the best we can do.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
