"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $900000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my desired investment range. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to say that $750000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. I'm counteroffering at $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $850000 is closer, but it's still slightly above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow you to make a profit while ensuring a fair deal for me. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
