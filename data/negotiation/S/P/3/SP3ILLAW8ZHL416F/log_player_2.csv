"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $900,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is an option.**  However, you want to save as much money as possible, so you should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my desired investment range. "", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair Counter:**  Starting with a significant counteroffer ($750,000) shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. This puts pressure on Alice.
* **Justification:**  The message highlights the value you see in the product while providing a clear reason for your counteroffer (budget). 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $750,000 leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to say that $750000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. I'm counteroffering at $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** While closer to your target, $850,000 is still $50,000 more than your max.
* **Negotiation continues.** There are still 7 rounds remaining, providing opportunity to chip away at the price.
* **Buying from John is tempting but not ideal.** You can potentially save $50,000 by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your target. Consider a counteroffer of $800,000 or slightly lower, acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit while staying within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but it's still slightly above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow you to make a profit while ensuring a fair deal for me. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You've shown a willingness to negotiate and are now firming up your position. This counteroffer is your absolute maximum and reflects your serious intent.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that this price allows Alice to profit while ensuring a fair deal for you. This promotes cooperation and avoids creating a ""take it or leave it"" situation.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies that you're prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept, adding a bit of pressure to reach a deal."
