"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know this is a valuable asset for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you might be willing to walk away, potentially pushing her to lower the price in a counter-offer.  Worst case, you can always buy from John at the same price."
