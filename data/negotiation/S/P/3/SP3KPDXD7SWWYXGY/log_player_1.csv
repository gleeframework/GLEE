{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's value of $80 but below your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm still not able to meet at $105. I would like to propose $100 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $100 is getting closer to my minimum of $120 and is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept his offer than risk further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer, especially since John is offering $120."
