# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit your business operations. Given its high value and the impact it could have on your endeavors, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $14,000. This represents a substantial saving compared to the market value of $15,000, while still ensuring a fair return for us. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and align with your strategic goals. Please let me know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget and her claimed market value is irrelevant. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or avoid going over your budget with John."
