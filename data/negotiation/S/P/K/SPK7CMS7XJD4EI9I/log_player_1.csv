Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $800,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has now hit his maximum price. While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still substantially less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures the best possible outcome for Alice."
