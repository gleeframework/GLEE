"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm  firmly at $850,000. If that's not acceptable, I'm prepared to move on to another seller.",850000.0,Bob,4,
