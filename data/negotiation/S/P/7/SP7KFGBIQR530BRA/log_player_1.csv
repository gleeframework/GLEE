Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm  firmly at $850,000. If that's not acceptable, I'm prepared to move on to another seller.

You have three options:

Bob seems firm on his $850,000 offer and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to move on to John."
