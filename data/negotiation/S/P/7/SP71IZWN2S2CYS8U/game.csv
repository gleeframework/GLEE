"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. Would you consider lowering the price closer to my maximum limit of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my asking price reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my situation. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I'm willing to pay, I still find it difficult to meet. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $950,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I can't go as low as $950,000.  My absolute lowest price for this product is $1,100,000.  This is a firm offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $900,000. Is there any way we could come to an agreement within this range?",900000.0,Bob,6,
