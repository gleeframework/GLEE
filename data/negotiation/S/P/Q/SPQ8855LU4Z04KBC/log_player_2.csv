Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is the price I'm willing to pay for the product, and it's also the price John is offering. By starting at my maximum, I create a clear point of negotiation and see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,150,000.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and this offer is a good compromise between our positions. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Alice to accept, but I'm still prepared to go to John if necessary."
