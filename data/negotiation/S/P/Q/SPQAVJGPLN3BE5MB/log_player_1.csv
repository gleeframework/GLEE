"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $1400000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $1,400,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  The value of this product truly warrants a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's worth and accommodates your budget.  Let's close this deal, I think this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
