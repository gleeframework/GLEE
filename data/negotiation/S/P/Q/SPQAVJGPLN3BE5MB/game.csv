"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  The value of this product truly warrants a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $1450000?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's worth and accommodates your budget.  Let's close this deal, I think this is a win-win for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
