Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** It gives Bob some room to negotiate but is still well above his valuation. 
* **Below your minimum:** It leaves room for you to make concessions if needed. 
* **Not too aggressive:** This avoids making Bob feel like the deal is unfair and potentially ending negotiations prematurely.

By starting with this offer, you create a good foundation for negotiation, giving you the best chance of securing a price that is close to your target of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still below your minimum value of $1,000,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  Shows you are willing to negotiate but not cave to his initial price.
* **Closer to your desired price:**  Keeps you closer to your target while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Reasonable:**  A $25,000 increase from Bob's offer is a reasonable step in the negotiation. 

By presenting this counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're serious about finding a mutually beneficial agreement while still holding onto your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $825,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price. While you could continue negotiating, the risk is that you may end up settling for a price that is significantly lower than your desired $1,000,000. 

By selling to John, you are guaranteed a price that meets your minimum and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
