``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build a rapport."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
