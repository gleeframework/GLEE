"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is likely much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
