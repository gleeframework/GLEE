Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and highlights the potential benefits for Bob. 
* **Option to Walk Away:**  I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John, so Bob knows I'm not desperate. 

This strategy aims to:

* Secure a higher price than Bob's initial valuation.
* Keep the negotiation open for potential counteroffers.
* Maintain the option to sell to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and continue the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John is always an option, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that still allows you to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that the price allows Bob to make a profit, appealing to his financial interests.
* **Urgency and Openness:** The message suggests a desire to reach an agreement while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,025,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $925,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $925,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  I'm not desperate and want to see if I can get a higher price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining the Option to Sell to John:** This option provides a safety net if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good margin for profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value and Profit:** I'm reminding Bob that the price is fair and offers him a good profit margin. 
* **Seeking a Final Agreement:** The message suggests a desire to reach a final agreement and move forward.

**Strategy:**  By continuing to negotiate, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired range while maintaining the option to sell to John if necessary."
