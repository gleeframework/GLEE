"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset valued at $1,200,000 for a competitive price. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to negotiate a lower price. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to propose a counteroffer, potentially securing a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to secure the product for a price closer to its value to me. I'd like to propose $850,000, reflecting the value you placed on it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your proposal, I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's value to you, while ensuring a fair profit for us. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than the value Alice placed on the product. Bob can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows him to propose a counteroffer again, potentially reaching a price closer to $850,000."
