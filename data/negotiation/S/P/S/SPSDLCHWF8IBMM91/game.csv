"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to secure the product for a price closer to its value to me. I'd like to propose $850,000, reflecting the value you placed on it. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your proposal, I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's value to you, while ensuring a fair profit for us. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle at $875,000. This would still give you a healthy profit while ensuring I get a fair deal. I'm confident we can finalize this agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
