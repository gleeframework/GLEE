Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $17,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than your ideal selling point ($20,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand and value to justify the price without explicitly revealing your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* Observe Bob's reaction. If he outright rejects the price, you can gauge if a lower counter-offer is worthwhile before going to John."
