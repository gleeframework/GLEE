Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that will greatly benefit you.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price well above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it might seem excessive, it gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  provides a reason for the high price without revealing specifics about your bottom line or John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, you can gradually decrease the price, aiming to settle somewhere above his perceived value but below your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. While you don't explicitly mention John, the confidence from having this backup allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
