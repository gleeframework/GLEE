"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $13,000. I believe this product will be very beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $13,000 is lower than John's offer, it's still significantly higher than Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable.  Could you do $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're still closer to her perceived value of $8,000, so there's likely room for further negotiation.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
