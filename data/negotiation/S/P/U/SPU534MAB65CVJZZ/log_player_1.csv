Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product exclusively to you before listing it publicly. I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Exclusive Offer:**  By framing the offer as exclusive, you create a sense of urgency and value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased in a way that invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to anchor our offer too closely to that number. By starting at $100, we leave space to potentially secure a higher profit. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we have the security of selling to John at our minimum acceptable price."
