"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90, it's not a good deal for you. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $80.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
