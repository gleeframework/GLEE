"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, I'm not quite ready to meet that price point.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
