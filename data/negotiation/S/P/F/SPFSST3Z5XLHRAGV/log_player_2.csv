Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

This is a good point to accept.  Alice seems firm on her price, and while we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  $1,050,000 is a reasonable price considering our alternatives."
