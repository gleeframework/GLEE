Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming for a negotiation. This leaves room for me to potentially make concessions while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but still staying above Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while also maintaining a price that's fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it seems unlikely that he'll offer more. It's better to accept his offer rather than risk getting a lower price in the next round or selling to John for the same amount."
