"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept the offer at the start. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for the possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower price ($10,000) than Alice's offer ($15,000) creates room for negotiation.  This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my maximum price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a lower price open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,500, which is still below Alice's offer of $13,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a lower price. The goal is to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $12,500, which is a good price, especially considering I have a fallback option at $15,000.  There's still a chance she might come down further, but I'm running out of rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the deal."
