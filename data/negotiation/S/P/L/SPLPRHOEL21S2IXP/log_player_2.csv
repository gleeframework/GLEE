"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. We believe it can significantly enhance your operations and increase efficiency. Considering its value to you, we're extending an exclusive offer at $950,000. This is a special opportunity not to be missed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's opening, but it's still within the realm of possibility given my $800,000 walk-away point. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  Even if Alice rejects this outright, it sets the stage for future counter-offers.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone with Alice, even while negotiating assertively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $825,000. We believe this offers a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my range, but I still have some room to negotiate. While $825,000 is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get closer to my $800,000 target, especially since I have plenty of rounds left and the option to go with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my budget is really capped at $800,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:** I'm being upfront with Alice about my budget limit. This can help build trust and potentially encourage her to make a final concession.
* **Final Offer (for now):**  I'm signaling that $800,000 is my firm limit. This doesn't mean I'll refuse to budge at all later, but it puts the ball in Alice's court to decide if she wants to make a deal now. 
* **Preserving the John Option:**  I still have the safety net of going to John if Alice refuses to budge."
