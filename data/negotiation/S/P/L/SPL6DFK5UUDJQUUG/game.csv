"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $90? That's still a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure I can go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay,87.5,Bob,6,
