"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always go down. This gives me room to negotiate and also sets a clear expectation of value. I'm also being friendly and engaging, which can help build a rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $16,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $16,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground, how about we meet at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing flexibility.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting a middle ground to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $16500 for the product. This is still within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,500 is a good deal. I've already rejected two offers from Bob, and it's getting closer to my minimum value.  I'm running the risk of Bob backing out or going back to his original offer, and I'm not confident I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's best to secure this sale now."
