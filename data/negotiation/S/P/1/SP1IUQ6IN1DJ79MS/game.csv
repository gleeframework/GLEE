"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a truly unique item. As we've discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000 for this. If you're willing to work within that, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
