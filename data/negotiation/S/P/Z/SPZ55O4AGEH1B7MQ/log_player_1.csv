{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's significantly above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while also leaving the door open for a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth attempting to negotiate further.  You can try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
