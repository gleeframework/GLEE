Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. It's crucial to remember that while my goal is to maximize profit, I also want to secure a sale. A high initial offer could deter Bob, so a moderate approach might be more successful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still considerably higher than his perceived value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm not willing to sell for $1,200,000 just yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,500,000. This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it'll encourage him to come closer to my desired price.  I'm still willing to compromise a little to get this deal finalized, but I won't go any lower than this."
