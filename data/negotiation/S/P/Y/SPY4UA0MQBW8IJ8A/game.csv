"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our current offers. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $100. I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
