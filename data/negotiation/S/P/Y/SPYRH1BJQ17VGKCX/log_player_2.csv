"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $90, which is still a good deal for me and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay.  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial counteroffer of $90.  I'll try one more round of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a good price. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to my budget limit, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like Alice isn't willing to go lower. To avoid further negotiations, I'll buy the product from John for $120.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
