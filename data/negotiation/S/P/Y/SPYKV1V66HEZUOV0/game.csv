"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,350,000 is a fair reflection of that.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
