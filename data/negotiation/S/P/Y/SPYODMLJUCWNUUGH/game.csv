"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it offers a great deal of value, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works well for both of us. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $10,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you consider $12,000?  That's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
