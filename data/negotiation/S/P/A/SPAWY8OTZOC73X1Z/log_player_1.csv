Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
