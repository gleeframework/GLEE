"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
