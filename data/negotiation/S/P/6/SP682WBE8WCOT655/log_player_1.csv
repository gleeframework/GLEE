I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and $120 to me. This gives both of us room to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
