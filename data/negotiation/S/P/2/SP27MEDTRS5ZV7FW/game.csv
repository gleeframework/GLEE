"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that initial price reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I'm confident you won't find this value proposition anywhere else.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is my final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
