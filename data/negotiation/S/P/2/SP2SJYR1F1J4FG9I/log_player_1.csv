Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob only has one chance to accept; this creates an opportunity for a higher offer.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal.  A price too close to his maximum valuation ($1,500,000) might make him overthink it.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and starts on a positive note.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob of its importance.
* **""Fair Deal"":**  Framing it this way emphasizes mutual benefit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives you a significant profit over your minimum while leaving Bob with a perceived savings of $150,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiation style."
