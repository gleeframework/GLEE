"Thank you for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find a happy medium.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm happy to meet you halfway,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price, given the product's value and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the time and effort I've invested in this product. My counteroffer is $1,320,000.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,320,000 is still a bit high. Let's try to find a final compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit while still remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,310,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance for the product, which will save you money in the long run. In return, I'd like $1,315,000. This is my final offer.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the added support and maintenance, but $1,315,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I will have to consider other options. ",1310000.0,Bob,8,
