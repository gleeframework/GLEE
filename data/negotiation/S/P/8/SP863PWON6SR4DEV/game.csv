"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $962,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you a good profit and giving me a price that works for me.",962500.0,Bob,4,
