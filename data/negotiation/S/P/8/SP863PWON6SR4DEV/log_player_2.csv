"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,025,000 is a better price than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. He wants to see if he can get Alice to come down further before resorting to buying from John."
