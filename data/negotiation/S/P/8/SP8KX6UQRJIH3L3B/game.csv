"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about we settle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but  $8,900 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
