"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my value. How about $11000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
