,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50. It's a fair price, and I hope we can close the deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit high. How about $91? It's close to your last offer, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",91.0,Bob,6,
