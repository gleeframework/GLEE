"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with more negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's more room for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50. It's a fair price, and I hope we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit high. How about $91? It's close to your last offer, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $100, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm concerned about losing out on any deal with Bob.  $91 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $120.  It's also possible that rejecting this offer will lead to a more drawn-out negotiation where I might not end up making a better deal."
