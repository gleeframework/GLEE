"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, considering its value to me is much lower than its value to you. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
