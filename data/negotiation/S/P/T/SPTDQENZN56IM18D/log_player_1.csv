{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still allows me to make a substantial profit. 
* **Message:** I'm being positive and friendly, highlighting the potential for a win-win situation. This can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering a lower price than my minimum acceptable price shows a willingness to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By starting with a lower offer, I create the potential for Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially getting us closer to a mutually beneficial price.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could hold out for my full $1,200,000, there's always the risk that negotiations will drag on, or Bob could walk away.  Offering a lower price encourages a faster decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 just yet. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with him or sell to John for my full asking price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I'm willing to explore a middle ground.
* **Higher Value:** Even though I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'd prefer to keep the negotiation open with Bob in case I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome, but it also limits my potential earnings.  Negotiating with Bob has the potential to be more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving the price up slightly to $950,000, finding a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:** By gradually increasing my offer, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range, without completely closing the door to a deal with Bob.
* **Building Towards Agreement:**  My message aims to foster a sense of mutual understanding and progress towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. This would be a great compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious decision if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is still below my desired price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob could take longer and may not yield a better result. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $920,000 is only $80,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a relatively small difference considering the potential time and risk involved in further negotiation.
* **Bob's Willingness:** Bob's message indicates a strong willingness to close the deal, making it likely that further negotiation might not yield a much higher offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** The opportunity cost of delaying the deal with Bob and possibly losing him entirely is significant. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision at this point, allowing me to secure a substantial sale with minimal risk and potential for further negotiation."
