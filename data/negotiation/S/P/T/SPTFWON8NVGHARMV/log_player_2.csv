{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the final round, and although Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget.  I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most prudent choice to  stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John.  I'm guaranteed to get the product for a price that meets my budget."
