Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still being attractive to Bob. 

* **Reasoning:**
    * You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so any price below that gives him a profit.
    * Offering $1,000,000 gives you a significant profit over your minimum of $800,000.
    * If Bob rejects, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000, so you're not taking a huge risk.

This strategy aims to strike a deal with Bob while keeping your options open if he declines."
