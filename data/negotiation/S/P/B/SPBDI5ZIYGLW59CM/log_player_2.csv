"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $14,000, while John is selling it for $15,000. 
* **You can save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $1,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, it's still a good deal for you at $14,000."
