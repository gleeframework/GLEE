Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially increase your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message maintains a professional and respectful tone, acknowledging Bob's potential interest while confidently presenting your offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that while the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he might not be willing to pay that much, especially if he's unaware of John's offer. 
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or stick closer to your initial price."
