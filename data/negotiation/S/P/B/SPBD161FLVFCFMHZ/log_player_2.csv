"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price closer to $12,000, and there's room for negotiation. He can counteroffer and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13500.  This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is now within his budget and closer to his goal. While he could continue to negotiate, he's already gotten a good deal and risks the possibility of Alice getting stubborn or the deal falling apart entirely."
