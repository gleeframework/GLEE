Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming for a price above $1 million, and giving up now would leave a significant sum on the table. We're willing to counter in hopes of reaching a compromise above $975,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer and represents the lowest I'm willing to go for this product."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

In this round, we're making a strategic move by offering a round number ($1,000,000) and presenting it as a ""firm offer.""  This creates a psychological anchor and signals to Bob that we are nearing our bottom line. This approach aims to:

* **Increase the perceived value:** Round numbers often feel more significant and can create a sense of a bargain for Bob. 
* **Convey seriousness:** By stating it's a firm offer, we emphasize the value of the product and our commitment to securing a fair deal. 
* **Encourage Bob to move closer to our target:** By holding firm at $1,000,000, we aim to prompt Bob to increase his offer closer to our desired outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we're still slightly below our $1 million target, Bob's offer of $980,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Here's why:

* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away, risking the entire deal.  Accepting now guarantees a significant profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. Closing the deal now allows us to re-invest the capital sooner.
* **Strong Return:** $980,000 is a substantial profit margin above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
 
It's important to recognize when a good offer becomes acceptable, even if it doesn't perfectly align with our initial aspirations."
