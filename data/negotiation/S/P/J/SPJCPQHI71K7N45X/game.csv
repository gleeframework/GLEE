,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. How about we meet at $102? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a deal that works for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
