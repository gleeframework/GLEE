# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. It's a one-time opportunity, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You're better off buying from John.  Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, and you're not getting a deal. John offers the same price, so you might as well go with the sure thing."
