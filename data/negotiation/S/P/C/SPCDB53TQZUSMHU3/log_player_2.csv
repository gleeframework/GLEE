```"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above what I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $10,250 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still higher than your budget of $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial to just buy from John.  You're guaranteed a price you're comfortable with, and you don't have to spend any more time negotiating."
