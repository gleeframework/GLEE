"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still above what I can manage right now.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product.  Let's make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you $10,250 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
