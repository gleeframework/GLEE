Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within your budget and a better price than buying from John. It's a fair price that saves you $10."
