**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a pattern of halving the difference between offers, and we're now at a point where his offers are significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it makes the most financial sense to take the sure thing."
