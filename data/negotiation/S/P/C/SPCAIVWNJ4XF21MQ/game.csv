"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I understand its value to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
