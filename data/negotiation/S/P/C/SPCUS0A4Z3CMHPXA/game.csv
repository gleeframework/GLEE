"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price allows for a decent profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the $1,000,000 value you mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $850,000.  I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which would be $887,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  I'm willing to offer $862,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",862500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $900,000, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this price. Let's see if we can wrap up the deal.",900000.0,Alice,7,
