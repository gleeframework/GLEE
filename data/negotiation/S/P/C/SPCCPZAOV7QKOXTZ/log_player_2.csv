"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-end item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:

This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

It's time to switch to John. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000, and you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk with diminishing returns."
