"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping it will pique Bob's interest and potentially lead to a profitable negotiation. If he rejects, we can adjust the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit margin for me. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to compromise while remaining firm on a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm only one round away from my safety net of $10,000 with John. I'll risk one more round of negotiation to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll go with John in the next round to ensure I at least get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We are at the final round and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price. It's better to secure the $10,000 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
