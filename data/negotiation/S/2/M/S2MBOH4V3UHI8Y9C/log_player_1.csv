Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is too low for me. This product is truly top-notch, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, so how about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
