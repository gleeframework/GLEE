"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's value to Alice ($80).  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob aims to get closer to Alice's value of $80. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point.
* **Negotiation:** By offering a price closer to Alice's value, Bob shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair deal. This sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** A $5 gap remains between Bob's offer and Alice's value. This allows for potential counteroffers from Alice without immediately hitting Bob's price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $87.50. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $87.50 is very close to Bob's target price of $85. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has demonstrated willingness to compromise, and accepting this offer avoids further negotiation.
* **Value vs. Risk:**  While a slightly better price might be possible, the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or reaching the 10-round limit and having to buy from John for $100 outweighs the potential savings."
