Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my current needs, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the value of this product is truly exceptional and it represents a significant investment for me as well. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000 for the product, a price that allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the minimum I need. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is a better outcome than further negotiation with Bob at this point."
