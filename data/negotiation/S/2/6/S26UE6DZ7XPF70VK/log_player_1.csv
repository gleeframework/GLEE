Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** The message emphasizes the potential value for Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 
* **Flexibility:**  By leaving room for negotiation, I avoid immediately alienating Bob and allow for a potential back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John gives me the confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000, and even below my starting offer of $10,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I have a better guarantee with John's offer, so I can afford to be more assertive with Bob. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the upper hand in the negotiation. I can use this as leverage to push Bob to offer a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000,  which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm not going to accept Bob's initial $8,000 offer, as it's far too low for me. My counter-offer of $9,000 is a compromise, but still significantly higher than his offer, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the benefits of a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging tone helps to keep the negotiation amicable and avoids potentially alienating Bob.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can afford to be somewhat firm with my counter-offer knowing I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $8,500 is closer to my minimum price, but it's still significantly lower than my starting price of $10,000 and my counter-offer of $9,000.
* **Negotiation stall:** Bob is unwilling to budge significantly from his initial offer.  This suggests that further negotiation might be unproductive and time-consuming.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $12,000 provides a guaranteed higher profit and less uncertainty than trying to further negotiate with Bob.  The potential loss in revenue from further negotiation is not worth the risk of Bob refusing to go higher."
