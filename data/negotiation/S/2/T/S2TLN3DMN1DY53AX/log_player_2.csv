"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $145 is cheaper than buying from John for $150.
* While Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($120), it's still within your budget of $150 and saves you money."
