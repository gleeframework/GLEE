"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, I'm still looking to get a better deal. How about $8,500?  That's still a good profit for you, and it's much closer to my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit out of your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,800?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,800 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $9,100. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Alice,5,
