"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's start with this offer and see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value to you. However,  $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal given its true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's consider $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalize a mutually agreeable deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
