"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget, and he can likely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's start with this offer and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the product's value to you. However,  $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal given its true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's consider $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a lower price closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalize a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
