Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about $950,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows you a good return on your investment.
