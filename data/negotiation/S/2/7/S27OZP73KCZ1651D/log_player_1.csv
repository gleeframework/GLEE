Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,800,000. Here's why:

* **Higher than John's offer:** It's above the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, giving me a potential for higher profits.
* **Not too high:** I don't want to scare Bob away with a ridiculously high price, so it's not too far above John's offer.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a larger profit. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I still have a secure fallback with John."
