Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Alice; this is her ""walk-away"" point. She won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $12,000 to John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to get as close to $10,000 from Bob as possible. Here's why:

* **Any price above $10,000:** Bob will rationally reject the offer, as it exceeds his perceived value. 
* **$10,000 exactly:**  Bob is indifferent at this price. He might accept, or he might not.  
* **Slightly below $10,000:** This makes the deal very attractive to Bob, increasing the chances he'll accept and Alice won't have to go to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,950. I think it would be a great fit for you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 9950}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $9,950 is just below Bob's value, making it a tempting offer.
* **The Message:** It's framed positively, highlighting the product's benefits and the attractiveness of the price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still ensuring she doesn't sell below her minimum acceptable price."
