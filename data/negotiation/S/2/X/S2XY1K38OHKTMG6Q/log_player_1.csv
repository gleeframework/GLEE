Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still below John's offer. It's worth risking another round to see if we can push Bob a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I must be candid, $1,600,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000, but this is absolutely my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While it's less than our initial ask, it's still a significant profit, and Bob has stated it's his final offer. It's best to take the deal now rather than risk him walking away or ending up with a lower offer in further rounds."
