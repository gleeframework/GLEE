"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'm comfortable with, but still a good deal for you. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
