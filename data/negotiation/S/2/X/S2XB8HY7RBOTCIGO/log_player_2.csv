"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's, but Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he offers $9,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation. This offer is still lower than Alice's original offer but leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's offer of $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially leaving him with only John's option is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees a good price and avoids further negotiation."
