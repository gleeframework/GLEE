"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it for $120, as that's my absolute maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little outside my budget. I'm firm on $120. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look at other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $145. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to purchase from John.",130.0,Bob,6,
