"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer.  A low starting point gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest but firmly states our budget limitations.
* **Target Price:** We're aiming for a price significantly below our $100 maximum, hoping Alice might be willing to settle closer to that range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $130 is still significantly more than your $100 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice lowered her price, suggesting she's willing to negotiate. There's still a chance to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:**  Keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations stall too close to $100, it's better to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $95? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $15, showing Alice we're serious about buying but also pushing our limit.
* **Final Offer:** By stating ""$95 is the highest I can go,"" we're signaling that this is likely our best offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still below our $100 maximum, leaving a small buffer if Alice counters. It's also getting closer to a price Alice might be willing to accept, as it's a significant discount from her initial offers."
