}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me at this point. Given your stated value for the product, I'd like to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for our negotiations. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous positions. How about we settle on $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and leaves room for us to close this deal fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay more than his initial offer, and we're still significantly above John's offer.  There's room for negotiation, and I want to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down by $50,000 shows flexibility but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** This can sometimes nudge the other party towards a decision, as they might fear losing the deal entirely.  
* **Still Above John:** We maintain a significant buffer above our guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Given our back-and-forth, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We've negotiated Bob up significantly from his initial offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Trying to squeeze out another $25,000 risks losing the deal entirely, which isn't worth jeopardizing a $1,175,000 sale.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties involved in further negotiation rounds."
