"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident that the product's value to me justifies this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's worth taking into consideration that he might walk away if I reject his offer.  I'll accept his offer and secure a sale."
