Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm close to accepting your offer.  $130 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to go down to $132.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice is likely very close to her bottom line. Accepting $132 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of her increasing the price or the negotiation falling through."
