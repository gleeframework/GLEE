"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you consider coming down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth is fair. Would you consider $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly settle around $12,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth and gives us both a fair deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be completely transparent, $13,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
