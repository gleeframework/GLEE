"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a more reasonable price before even considering accepting.  Buying from John at $8,000 is a good backup plan, but let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you consider coming down to that price?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely and explains that the initial offer is unrealistic for me.
* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price around $10,000, which gives me some bargaining space to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth is fair. Would you consider $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $18,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and my maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her message suggests she's willing to negotiate further. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically. 
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Alice don't lead to a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly settle around $12,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but not drastically. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but holding firm to a reasonable budget.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** $12,000 feels like a potential compromise point. It's a significant jump from my last offer but still much lower than her last counter-offer. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to my walk-away point. If Alice isn't willing to move closer to my range in the next round or two, I'll likely take John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth and gives us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $15,000 is closer, but it's still above my $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Slow Progress:**  Alice is coming down in price, but very slowly. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with before I have to consider John's offer seriously.
* **Final Counteroffer:** I'll use my next turn to give her my best and final offer. If she doesn't accept, I'll go with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be completely transparent, $13,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is a strong but firm offer.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, signaling my seriousness.  
* **Deadline:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice of my alternative (John's offer) without being confrontational.  
* **Clear Intention:**  I'm making it clear that I'm ready to buy *right now* at this price, putting the decision firmly in Alice's hands."
