Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you consider coming down to that price?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to its true worth is fair. Would you consider $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we possibly settle around $12,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $12,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet halfway at $15,000? This reflects the product's worth and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. To be completely transparent, $13,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.
