Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. How does $119 sound?"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, the price John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
