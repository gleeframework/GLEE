Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's value of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I mention that the product is valuable to him, subtly reinforcing the potential benefit he'll gain. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll be watching for Bob's response, and will adjust my strategy based on his reaction. I'll be prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I also have the option to go with John's $8,000 offer if it seems like I won't be able to reach a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth, considering Bob's valuation.  I'm going to try to get closer to the middle ground. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by saying I need to get at least $10,500 to make it ""worthwhile"". 
* **Middle Ground:** I propose meeting halfway between our last offers,  showing a willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,500, which is still a good deal for me and is closer to the middle ground between our valuations.  I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in coming to a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit more. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is very close to my desired price of $10,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal, accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale.  

* **Risk of Rejection:** There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might lower his offer further, or even walk away from the deal. 
* **Value of Time:** It's also important to consider the value of my time.  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, which could be better spent on other opportunities. 

Accepting this offer is a good balance of risk and reward, and it's a positive outcome for me."
