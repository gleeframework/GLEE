"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows for a good profit while reflecting your valuation of the item. Let's continue our discussion towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $10,750.  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
