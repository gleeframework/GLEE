"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to adjust our negotiation terms slightly. I would like to offer the product to you for $90. This price still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while reflecting the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me. I'm really aiming to stay under $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That would be a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to adjust my offer to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product to you for $88. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while ensuring you receive a good value for your purchase.",88.0,Alice,5,
