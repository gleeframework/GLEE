"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $105?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  I could go up to $90, but that's really the most I can do.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97.50? This price is still within my acceptable range, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $92.50?  That's the best I can do.",92.5,Bob,6,
