Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a good price. I'll also be watching for signs that Bob is genuinely interested to see if I can push the price even higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,850,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than selling to John.  It seems like we're close to a compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more."
