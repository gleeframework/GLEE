"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,000? That's the price I'm willing to pay for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
