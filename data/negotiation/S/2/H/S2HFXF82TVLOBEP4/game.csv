"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $12,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $13,250. This shows I'm serious about making this deal work, but I need to be compensated fairly for the product's value. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,
