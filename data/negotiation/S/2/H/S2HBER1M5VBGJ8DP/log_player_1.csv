{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, so $13,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay more, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust the price if Bob offers a lower price.

By offering this price, you're setting the stage for a mutually beneficial negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You're willing to negotiate, but you're not desperate to sell.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could we do $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has come up to $11,500, which is only $500 away from your counteroffer of $12,000.  It's likely he won't budge much further, and accepting his offer secures you a profit of $1,500.  While you'd ideally like more, it's a good deal considering your alternative is selling to John for $10,000."
