"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $108. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",108.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $108, Bob. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $109. This is my final offer.",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $107 for the product. This is my final offer.",107.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $107. I've already offered you a great deal, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think the product is worth $120, and that's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse.",120.0,Alice,9,
