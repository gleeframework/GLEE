Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup over my guaranteed price of $1,200,000 from John. Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product more than $1,500,000. By setting a high price, I maximize my potential earnings.
* **Risk assessment:**  I'm willing to risk Bob rejecting the offer, knowing I have a guaranteed fallback option with John.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, it gives me a starting point for negotiation. I can potentially lower the price slightly if needed to secure a sale with Bob.

This strategy balances the need for profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
