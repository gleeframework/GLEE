Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, given my current budget constraints.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
