"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.**  You are only willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means you can negotiate with her further or explore other options.**  It's possible that Alice will lower her price if you reject her initial offer. 
* **Buying from John is not the best option right now.** While it's within your budget, Alice's offer is already lower."
