Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving Room:** This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** I am aware that I can sell the product to John for $150, so I am not willing to accept an offer lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John's Offer:** I am aware that John is willing to pay $150, so I am not in a rush to accept a significantly lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100).  
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  The message emphasizes that this price is a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** $125 is still above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Staying Flexible:** This allows me to potentially negotiate a higher price while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about $110?  That's a firm offer on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Close to John's Offer:**  I'm close to John's offer of $150.  It's not worth risking a lower price for the chance to get a slightly better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  I can counteroffer again and potentially reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115?  I'm willing to go a little lower to make this work, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Higher:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Final Offer:** This gives Bob a sense of urgency and makes it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Balancing Risk:** While $115 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and is likely a better deal than selling to John for $150.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:** A final offer could help avoid a long negotiation that might result in a stalemate or me selling to John."
