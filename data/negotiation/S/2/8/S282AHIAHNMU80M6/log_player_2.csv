"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable bargaining range. It leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about buying but need a better price.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message is polite and avoids being confrontational, which is important for maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but her offer of $125 is still more expensive than John's $120 price. You're aiming for the best possible deal, so it's worth seeing if you can get closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about $110?  That's a firm offer on my end."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($100) and Alice's current offer ($125). It shows willingness to compromise but also holds firm to a price closer to your target.
* **""Firm Offer"" Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious and unlikely to budge further. This can encourage her to accept if she's genuinely interested in making a deal.
* **Still Above John's Price:**  While $110 is your firm offer to Alice, it's important to remember that John's offer of $120 is still available. This gives you a fallback option if Alice rejects your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115?  I'm willing to go a little lower to make this work, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not your ideal price, Alice's offer of $115 is only $5 more than John's offer. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, especially since she's stated it's her final offer.
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could be fruitless and time-consuming. Accepting now secures the product for a reasonable price."
