"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $1,250,000 is still below my bottom line. To move this forward, I can offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we settle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I respect your approach. Let's find a middle ground.  If we agree on $1,260,000, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today. This offer reflects my genuine desire to find a win-win solution.",1260000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer. How about we settle at $1,230,000?",1230000.0,Bob,8,
