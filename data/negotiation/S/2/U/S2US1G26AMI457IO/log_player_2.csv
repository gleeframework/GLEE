# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1850000.

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your maximum budget. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  You'll save $350,000 compared to Alice's latest offer."
