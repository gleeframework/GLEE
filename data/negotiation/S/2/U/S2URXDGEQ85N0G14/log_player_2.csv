Alice is playing hardball, and this seems like a tactic to get me to settle. I'll push back one more time, but be prepared to go up slightly if she remains firm."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $11,500, and while it's not my ideal price, she's offering extras. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.  It's a decent price compared to John's $15,000, and the extras could add value."
