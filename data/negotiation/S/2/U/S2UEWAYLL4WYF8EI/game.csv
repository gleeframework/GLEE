"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $1,600,000. This allows both of us to gain from this transaction.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
