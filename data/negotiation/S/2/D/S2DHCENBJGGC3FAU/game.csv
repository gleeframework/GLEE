"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I believe this product has great potential, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. My counteroffer is $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be open to $775,000? I feel this represents a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to give up on the higher end of the price range just yet. My next counteroffer is $825,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value. Let's make this simple: $800,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
