"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible, but I want to ensure I get a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000 at this point. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not willing to sell for $9,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm also starting to consider selling to John, as he offers a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is my minimum threshold, and I'm willing to sell at this price.  However, I'm also seriously considering selling to John at this point."
