"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To start, I'd offer $900000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1100000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This would give us both a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and takes into account the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
