I'm starting with a price of $17,000, which is above my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}

I'm going to counter with $16,500.  This is still a good price for Bob since it's below his initial value, but it's closer to my desired profit margin."

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already come down from my initial offer.  Rather than continue negotiating with him, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further haggling with Bob."
