"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend around $7500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8000.  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal, and we can finalize the sale.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8150 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",8150.0,Alice,5,
