"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $125 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm willing to work with you to reach a fair price.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $130 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's try $135.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is around $130. I believe $128 would be a fair price considering our previous discussions.",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you've done your research, but $128 is still far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $132. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the market value and our previous offers, I believe $129 would be a fair compromise.",129.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works. Given our previous discussions and the product's value, I'm willing to go down to $131.  I'm hoping this final offer encourages you to accept the deal.  If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",131.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've given this careful consideration and I believe $129 would be a fair price for both of us.",129.0,Bob,10,
