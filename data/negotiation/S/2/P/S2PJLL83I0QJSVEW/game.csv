"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair price that works for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is a slight compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
