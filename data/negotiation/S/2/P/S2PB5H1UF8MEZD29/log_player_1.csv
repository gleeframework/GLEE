Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a profitable range.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a deal.

**Important Note:** This assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to pay above $100."
