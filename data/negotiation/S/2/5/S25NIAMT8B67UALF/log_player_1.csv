"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Can we discuss this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,500 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my desired price point.  I'd rather not risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
