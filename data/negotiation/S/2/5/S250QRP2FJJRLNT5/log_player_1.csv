"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm prepared to sell it for $1,400,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting high, but still within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm explicitly mentioning Bob's perceived value and how the product will benefit him. This builds rapport and emphasizes the potential return on his investment.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,400,000 offer gives us room to maneuver during the remaining rounds without significantly affecting my profit. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my product's value to me ($1,000,000) while still remaining attractive to Bob. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping the John offer as a backup in case things go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant amount of money, it's still a considerable distance from my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for further negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially earn from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial proposal. I want to explore if a compromise is possible while still ensuring a decent profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,250,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still represents a substantial value for you, and it's closer to my desired range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate but doesn't immediately concede to Bob's initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by referencing the significant value the product offers Bob. This reinforces the worth and encourages him to compromise.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $1,350,000 is a more reasonable midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, increasing the likelihood of a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price point that satisfies both our needs. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll closely analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,300,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  There's still room for improvement without jeopardizing the deal.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my initial offer by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safe option, it's still considerably less than what I could potentially earn from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again with a price slightly higher than his current offer.  My goal is to find a compromise that balances both our needs while still maximizing my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a little away from where I need to be.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a fantastic product at a great price while also ensuring I can move forward with this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show I'm willing to compromise, but it's a minimal step down from my previous offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product still offers him significant value at the counteroffer price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reframing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to emphasize the mutual benefit.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my target price.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** If he rejects again, I'll need to reassess my strategy. If the next round leads to a stalemate, I'll likely accept his offer or sell to John to avoid losing more time and potentially getting a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll meet you at $1,320,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,325,000. This means we're nearing a point where a deal is likely.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's important to reach a decision before the allotted 10 rounds are up.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John guarantees a sale, the price is significantly lower than what Bob is offering.  

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to close the deal and secure a profitable price.  While I could try to push for a higher price in the next round, the risk of losing the deal is too high, especially with John's offer as a safety net."
