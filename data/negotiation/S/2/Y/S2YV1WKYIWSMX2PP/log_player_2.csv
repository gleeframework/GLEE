"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1250000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. It's still a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let's meet in the middle!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a lower price. He can aim for a price closer to $1,300,000 in his next counteroffer."
