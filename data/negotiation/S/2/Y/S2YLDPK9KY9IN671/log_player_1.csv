Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll see the same. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to close this."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I've already been through 4 rounds, and Bob is unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with the same price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
