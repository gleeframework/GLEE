"I can see you're really interested in the product, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $122, which is closer to what I'm looking for. Can you meet me at this price?",122.0,Bob,6,
