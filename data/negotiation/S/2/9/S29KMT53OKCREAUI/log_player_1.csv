"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion. I want Bob to feel like we're working together.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $100 is a good starting point, as it's not too far off from Bob's valuation, making him more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There's room for further negotiation, and I believe I can get a better deal.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a price closer to my minimum by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while staying close to my desired price. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message highlights the ""fair price"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $92 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a price closer to my minimum by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's still room for a small compromise, and I want to see if I can get closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $93.50. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 93.50} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference between my last offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($92) shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Again, emphasizing ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him more likely to accept.
* **Directness:**  Using a direct and concise message can help speed up the negotiation process, especially with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $93.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $90, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting close to its end.  
* **Unfavorable Offer:** Bob's final offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum of $120 and not close enough to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and ensures a quick and profitable transaction. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing out on this guaranteed sale.

Given the limited time and the unsatisfactory offer from Bob, I choose to sell the product to John for $120."
