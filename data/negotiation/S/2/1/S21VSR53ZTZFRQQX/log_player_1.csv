Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, or sell to John for a higher amount."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but no higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum. John is offering my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
