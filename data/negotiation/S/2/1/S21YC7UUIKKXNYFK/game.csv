"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This shows my willingness to work with you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",1700000.0,Alice,3,
