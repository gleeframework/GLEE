"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me. I believe it could be even more valuable to you, depending on your needs. I'm willing to let go of it for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $1,500,000, exceeding your maximum budget.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John at the lower price."
