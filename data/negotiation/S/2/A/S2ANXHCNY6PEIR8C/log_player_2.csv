"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $600000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
