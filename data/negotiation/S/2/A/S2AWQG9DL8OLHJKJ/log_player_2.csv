"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth exploring if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob should start by offering his maximum budget. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but has a firm limit. It also sets the negotiation range and forces Alice to consider his offer seriously."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He's already shown his maximum with his counteroffer, so he should continue to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should offer a slightly higher price than his maximum budget. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. He's willing to compromise but not at a significant loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's the lowest offer so far, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating, as he has 5 more rounds to reach a favorable price. It's still worth seeing if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but gradually.  He's showing Alice he's serious about buying but wants a fair price. This keeps the negotiation moving without risking a breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still $5,000 more than he's willing to pay.  He has three rounds left and should keep negotiating. It's possible he can get closer to his goal, especially as Alice is already lowering her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer, but by smaller increments. He's trying to find a compromise point where both he and Alice can agree. With only three rounds left, he needs to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still $4,500 more than he's willing to pay. This is his last chance to make a counteroffer, so he should try to get as close to his goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

Bob is taking a calculated risk here. He's pushing his counteroffer close to his maximum budget, hoping to get a deal. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and this final offer could be enough to close the deal. If Alice rejects it, Bob will have to buy from John, but he's at least trying to get the best possible price."
