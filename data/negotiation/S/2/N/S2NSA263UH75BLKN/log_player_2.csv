"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really appreciate! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a steal considering its value to you, and it's a great deal for me as well. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your alternative."
