Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Not Too Greedy:** While I want the best price, I'm not starting with an outrageous offer that would immediately shut down the conversation. 

This approach allows for a negotiation while also setting a strong initial position.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and significantly lower than my initial offer of $115.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's interest shows potential for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale for $120 with John, which gives me leverage during the negotiation. 

This approach allows me to keep negotiating with Bob while having a fallback option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain Leverage:** $105 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive Tone:**  Keeping a friendly and open tone keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

This counteroffer balances my need for a higher price with the desire to keep the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I think we can do better than $105. How about $95? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's ""willing to meet you halfway"" comment suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher. 
* **John's offer remains:** I have a guaranteed sale for $120 with John, which allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without urgency.

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $105.  This keeps the negotiation alive while maintaining my position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $100.  That's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a clear willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm making it clear that this is a fair and final offer.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.

By offering $100, I'm close to my desired price point while still remaining within the realm of reasonable negotiation. This approach aims to finalize the deal with Bob, and if he rejects, I can confidently move on to John's offer."
