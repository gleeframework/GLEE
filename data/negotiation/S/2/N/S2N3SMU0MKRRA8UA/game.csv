"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
