``` 

This offer represents a significant discount from my minimum desired value of $1,200,000, but it's still above Bob's estimated value of $800,000. This approach aims to find a middle ground while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value, and even lower than his own estimated value of $800,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant loss. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
