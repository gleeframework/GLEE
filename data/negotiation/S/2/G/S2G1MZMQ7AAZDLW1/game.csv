"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves some room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
