Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price slightly higher. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a backup who will buy it for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
