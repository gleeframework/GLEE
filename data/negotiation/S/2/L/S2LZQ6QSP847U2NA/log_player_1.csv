"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still leaving me with a profit well above my minimum of $15,000. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is way too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum.  $17,500 is a reasonable compromise and hopefully will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is still too low for me. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'll counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $15,500. This is a small concession, but it shows good faith and might entice Bob to agree.  It's still above my minimum and leaves me with a decent profit. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for $15,000 when I could potentially get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$13,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm getting close to the end of the rounds.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time and see if Bob is willing to budge. If he doesn't, I'll go with the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This is my final offer. I'm offering $14,500, which is only $500 above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and finally agree. If not, I will have to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's down to the wire and Bob is still refusing to meet me halfway. With only two rounds left, I need to secure a sale. I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round. I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
