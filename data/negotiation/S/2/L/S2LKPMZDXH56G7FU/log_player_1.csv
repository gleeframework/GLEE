Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but could we work something closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
