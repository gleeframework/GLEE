"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but could we work something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the potential this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,250,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
