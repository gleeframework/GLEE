Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, your initial offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

This would be a significant profit for you and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.
