"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, your initial offer is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you while still allowing me to make a worthwhile investment. I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to close the deal today for $975,000.  This would be a significant profit for you and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,012,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
