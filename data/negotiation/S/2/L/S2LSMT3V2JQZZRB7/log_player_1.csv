{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  This would still be a great value for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

``` 

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price and it's better than selling to John for the same amount."
