"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a counteroffer of $8500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit above the price I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $8200. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit above $8200. I'd be willing to pay $7900 for the product. Can you consider that?",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $8400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally meet at a price you're comfortable with.",8400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $8400 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7800, but I'm starting to think that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me there or do we need to part ways?",7800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8400, and I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. I'm willing to make a final offer of $8350, but I need you to meet me at this price or we'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8350.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $8350. I'd be willing to pay $7900, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $8000.",7900.0,Bob,10,
