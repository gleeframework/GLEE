"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob.  This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is my final offer, and it's exactly my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
