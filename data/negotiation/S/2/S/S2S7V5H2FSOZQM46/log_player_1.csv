Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially earn an even higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further, in which case you'll need to decide if you want to lower your price or stick to John's guaranteed offer."
