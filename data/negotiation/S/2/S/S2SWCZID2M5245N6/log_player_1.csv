Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I highlight the value the product holds for him, framing it as a good deal.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counter, as he likely won't accept the first offer. 

By starting at $12,000, I can potentially negotiate up to $15,000 before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Even though Bob is willing to pay a premium, he is still well below my desired range. There's potential to negotiate higher.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I know I can secure $15,000 from John, giving me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to secure a higher price in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $10,500 is a significant jump from Bob's $9,000 offer, but still lower than my initial $12,000.
* **Emphasize mutual benefit:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, framing the price as fair for both sides.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  The message implies that I'm open to further negotiation while still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while maintaining my position of seeking a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $10,250? I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer:** $10,250 is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly higher price, especially considering John's offer of $15,000.
* **Time and effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the time and effort involved in further negotiation.

While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of rejection and further negotiation outweighs the potential gain. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is close to my minimum and avoids the possibility of selling at a lower price or needing to accept John's offer."
