"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
