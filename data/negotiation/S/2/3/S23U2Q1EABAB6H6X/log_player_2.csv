"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate an even lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially ending up paying $15,000 to John isn't worth the potential savings."
