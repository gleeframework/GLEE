"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000, given its unique benefits and potential ROI. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's strategic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better chance of getting a price closer to your target.
* **Respectful Tone:** Even though we're aiming low, it's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message indicates flexibility and a willingness to discuss price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $8,000.  Could you consider something closer to $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down slightly, $13,000 is still above both your budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's message suggests she's open to negotiation, using phrases like ""could you consider."" This indicates we might be able to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Exists:** You still have the option of buying from John at a lower price, which gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer sets a firm limit at your maximum budget ($10,000). By stating it's your ""final offer,"" you signal seriousness to Alice.
* **Justification:** The message explains that this price is driven by your budget limitations, making it a stronger argument.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $10,000 positions it as a compromise â€“ a middle ground between your initial offer and her most recent price. 

**Important Note:** While you're aiming to buy at $10,000, if Alice counteroffers at a price slightly above (e.g., $10,500), it might be worth considering to close the deal quickly."
