"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your need for a profit, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my target. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal, and we can both move on.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get at least $11,250. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to meet you there. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
