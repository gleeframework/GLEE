"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit.  A starting price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying close to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to be polite but firm. By observing Bob's reaction to this initial offer, I can get a better understanding of his negotiating style and how eager he is to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product offers you even greater returns.  How about we meet halfway at $900,000? This reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** This counteroffer suggests a spirit of compromise while still holding firm to a strong valuation. It's a significant move from my initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's high value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $900,000. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated but also trying to find my bottom line.  While $875,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for at least $890,000 and believe it's achievable with continued negotiation.  I'll hold firm for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's find a solution â€“ I'm willing to come down to $890,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and offers a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($10,000 instead of $25,000) to signal that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding at $890,000, which is a strong price point, but I'm framing it as a solution that benefits both parties to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I need to apply a bit more pressure to try to close the deal soon, or I may risk Bob digging in further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $870,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating but seems to be moving in smaller increments. His latest offer is only a $5,000 increase from his previous one. This suggests he might be reaching his limit, but I'm not willing to settle for $870,000 yet. I'll hold firm and see if he's willing to budge further.  I'm still aiming for at least $880,000 and believe it's worth the risk of one more rejection."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your position, and I'm ready to close this deal.  How about we settle at $880,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my bottom line to put a little pressure on Bob. By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to push him towards a decision.
* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:**  $880,000 is a compromise from my original goal, but it's still a substantial profit above John's offer. 
* **Time Is Running Out:**  We're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I need to incentivize Bob to close the deal now, or I'll need to seriously consider John's offer to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer Is Too Low:** Bob has decreased his offer, indicating he's unwilling to meet my price. Accepting $860,000 would be a significant loss compared to my $880,000 bottom line.
* **Stalemate Likely:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, making a successful counteroffer unlikely. Further negotiation could be fruitless and waste valuable time.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's standing offer of $800,000 guarantees a reasonable profit. While not ideal, it's better than risking a complete breakdown with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer in later rounds.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a guaranteed win with John."
