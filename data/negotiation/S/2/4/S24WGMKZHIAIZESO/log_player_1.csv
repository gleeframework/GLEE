Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Flexibility:** This initial offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation with Bob, giving me the chance to potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have the option to sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120 for this product. Would it be possible for us to reach a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, his message suggests he's open to negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a great price for this product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $140 offer.
* **Midpoint:** $130 is the midpoint between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120), demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good rapport and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to push him towards accepting.

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable offer while still allowing me to get a price closer to my desired amount."
