"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a good starting point. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, as it's more than you value the product at.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,750?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm really committed to getting this product, but $9,200 is still a little too high.  How about $8,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
