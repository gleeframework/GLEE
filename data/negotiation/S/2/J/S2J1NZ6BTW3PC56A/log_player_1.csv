Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for $15,000 to John, so that's my floor.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so that's his ceiling.
* **Finding a middle ground:** $12,000 is a compromise that is higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This gives me a chance to earn a decent profit while potentially enticing Bob to accept the deal. 
* **Negotiation:**  By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, I'm leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
