"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value it brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I need to make a decision soon. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $980000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it brings to you.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target, so I'm going to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $1020000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. This price takes into account the value the product brings to you and allows me to make a profit. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
