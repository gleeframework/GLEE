"Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we compromise at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
