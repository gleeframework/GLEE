Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects your initial offer or negotiations fall through, you can proceed with selling to John at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John. 
* Gauge Bob's interest level throughout the negotiation to adjust your approach if needed."
