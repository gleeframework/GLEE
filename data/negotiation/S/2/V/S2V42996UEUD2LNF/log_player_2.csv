# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. Given its high value and unique features, it's worth $10,000 to you. Considering its market value and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure this valuable asset at a significant discount. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value."
