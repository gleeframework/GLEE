"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so rejecting the initial offer allows him to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise. It's still a lower price than John's offer, and it's close to Bob's desired price of $130.  It's likely that further negotiation wouldn't get a significantly lower price, so accepting the offer is the best option to maximize savings."
