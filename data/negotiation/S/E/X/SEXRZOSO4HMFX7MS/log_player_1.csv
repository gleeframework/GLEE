Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  Negotiation is complex, and Bob's personality and negotiation style could influence the optimal strategy."
