"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. My initial offer is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget, there's no point in accepting it. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $900,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is still not fully reflected in your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more movement. My revised offer is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice has moved closer to your offer, but it's still above your ideal price.  You can likely get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm ready to offer $950,000.  Is that something we can work with?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I still feel that $950000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see a bit more movement. My revised offer is $975000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While you might be able to squeeze a little more out of her, it's likely that  she won't go any lower. At this point, it's probably best to accept and avoid the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially leaving you with no deal. You're still saving a considerable amount of money compared to John's price."
