I'm offering it to you for a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.

This price allows for a significant return on your investment while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let me know if you're interested, I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
