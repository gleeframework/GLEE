Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's not overly aggressive:**  A much higher offer might make Bob immediately reject it. 

By starting with a reasonable offer, you set the stage for a successful negotiation. You can then adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  While it's still lower than I'd like, it's closer to my initial offer and above my minimum.  It's also a sign that Bob is genuinely interested and willing to negotiate. It's more important to secure a sale than to hold out for a price that might not be attainable."
