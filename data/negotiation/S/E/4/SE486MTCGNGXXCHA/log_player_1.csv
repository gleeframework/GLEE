Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $825,000 is getting close, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm also considering selling to John if I don't get a better deal from Bob.  I have to be strategic here and ensure I get the best possible price."

I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  We've reached an impasse with Bob, and I'm running out of time.  John is a reliable buyer and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I have to be realistic and secure the sale."
