"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit above my budget, but I'm interested. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a fair price. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $88 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $89? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",89.0,Bob,6,
