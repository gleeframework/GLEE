"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-demand item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 is already within your budget.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal budget. You're aiming to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue trying to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This offer is fair, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's reach an agreement and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a further adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go down to $825,000. I'll offer you the product for $850,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value you place on it. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is now within your budget and represents a good compromise.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible or you might run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer secures the product and saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
