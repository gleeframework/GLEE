"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,000,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to come down closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
