"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product name] for a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. This product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This is a price that allows me to make a good profit while giving you a substantial savings. Consider this a win-win situation. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
