"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep working with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my end. What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
