"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still over your target of $8,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option for the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still above your target price of $8,000. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep working with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my end. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $8,875 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what John is offering. You're nearing the end of the rounds, and it's better to guarantee a price you're comfortable with. Buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially sound decision at this point."
