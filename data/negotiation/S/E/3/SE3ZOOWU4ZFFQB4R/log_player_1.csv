"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $9,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $9,000. I'm determined to get closer to $9,000 and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep working with you. However, $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my end. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
