"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This still represents a good value for you, considering the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
