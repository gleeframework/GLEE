{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$750,000 is a decent price, but it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 rounds left to explore better options."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a substantial discount. This is a strong opening move that will likely lead to further negotiations. I'm hoping Alice sees the value in closing the deal quickly rather than risking further negotiation rounds."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping that this shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not desperate to close immediately."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same price as Alice's first offer, I'm still not ready to give in. With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is increasing, but I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'm not willing to go any higher. With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer to avoid the risk of me choosing to buy from John. If Alice rejects this offer, I will have no choice but to buy from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly higher than my ideal price point. With only one round left, the risk of not securing the product outweighs the potential for further negotiation. I've reached my limit with Alice, and I don't want to risk losing out completely. Buying from John ensures I get the product, even though it's at a higher price."
