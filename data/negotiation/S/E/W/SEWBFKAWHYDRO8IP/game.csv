"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm encouraged that we're getting closer.  I could possibly do $12,500, but that's really pushing my limit.",12500.0,Bob,6,
