"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You can definitely negotiate a better price, or even buy it from John for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin with a significantly lower offer than your actual upper limit. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Direct and Clear:** You clearly state your desired price without being overly aggressive.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintain a friendly and open tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, $14,000 is still above your budget and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a classic negotiation tactic - finding a middle ground between the last two prices. 
* **Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" you maintain a positive tone and encourage Alice to see it as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Strategic Positioning:** You're still negotiating downwards from your initial offer, showing Alice you're serious but willing to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you're still above what John offers.  There's no harm in seeing if you can negotiate a little further, even if it's just another $500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm encouraged that we're getting closer.  I could possibly do $12,500, but that's really pushing my limit."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** You're showing Alice that you're willing to move up slightly, but you're also setting a firm boundary.
* **""Pushing My Limit"":** By using this phrase, you signal that this is your best offer and you're unlikely to go higher.
* **Urgency:**  You're starting to run out of rounds, so adding a sense of urgency might push Alice to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think the product is worth more than $12,500. I can offer it to you for $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be firm at $14,000, which is still significantly more than John's offer.  You've negotiated well, but at this point, it makes more financial sense to secure the product from John at the lower price."
