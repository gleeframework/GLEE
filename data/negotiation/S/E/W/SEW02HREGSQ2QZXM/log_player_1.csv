"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. My initial price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate, and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate you making a counteroffer. While I can't go as low as $90, I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's find a middle ground, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering $100, still slightly above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? This way, we both get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which was $90. Could we try $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I still feel I can do better. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will agree to this compromise, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If he doesn't accept this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, which was $97.50. Could we try $96.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
