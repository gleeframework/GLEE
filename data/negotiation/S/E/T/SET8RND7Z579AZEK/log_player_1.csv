Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it is still lower than the $12,000 you would get from John. This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a sale while still earning a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can confidently move on to John."
