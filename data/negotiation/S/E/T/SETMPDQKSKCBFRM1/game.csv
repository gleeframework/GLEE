"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity.  While the product looks great, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go up to $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",11500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  What do you think? ",11000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go back to $11,000. I think the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. That's the lowest I can go.",11200.0,Alice,5,,
