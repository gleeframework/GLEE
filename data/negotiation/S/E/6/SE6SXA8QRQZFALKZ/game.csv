"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I believe it would be a valuable asset and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to go lower? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows me to stay within my budget and hopefully still gives you a good deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
