Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,500 is still too far from what I had in mind.  To be honest, I can't justify going over $12,000 for the product. If you're willing to work within that range, I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that final offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and dragging it out risks losing both Bob and John.
* **Profitable Deal:** $13,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired outcome than his previous offers.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing might lead to a stalemate or an unreasonable counteroffer. Accepting shows I'm willing to make a deal."
