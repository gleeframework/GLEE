Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you know Bob's perceived value is lower, there's no harm in starting with a price significantly above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, you gain a substantial profit above your minimum and above his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. However, there's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. You'll need to gauge his reaction and be prepared to negotiate if necessary, potentially lowering the price closer to his perceived value but still above your minimum."
