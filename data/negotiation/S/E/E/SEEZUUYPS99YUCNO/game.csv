,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",13500.0,Alice,3,
