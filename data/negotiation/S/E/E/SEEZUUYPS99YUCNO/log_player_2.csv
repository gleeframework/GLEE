"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product. I'm looking for $15000 for it. It's a fantastic item that I think you'll really appreciate, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. 
* There's no reason to immediately buy from Alice. You have no information about the product's value to her, so there's potential to negotiate a lower price. 
*  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12,000? I believe this is a fair offer, considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $15,000 to $13,500, which is a significant reduction. 
* You're still within your budget and getting a slightly better price than you initially offered. 
* It's unlikely you'll get Alice to go much lower, as she's stated this is the lowest she's willing to go. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product without further risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers or you having to buy from John at a higher price."
