"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium for it, especially in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a better deal.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my target price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for a compromise that would benefit both of us, and I'm determined to get as close to my target price as possible before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. It's a win-win situation for both of us, and I believe it's the best possible outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still below my target price.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my target price of $1,000,000, I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to him.  It's a secure deal that will ensure I get my desired amount, and it's better than risking a lower price or running out of time with Bob."
