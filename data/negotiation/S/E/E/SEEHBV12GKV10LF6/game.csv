"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. It's a win-win situation for both of us, and I believe it's the best possible outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
