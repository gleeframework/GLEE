"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. My initial offer is $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $850,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $850,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $825,000.  This is a very fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. My counteroffer is $875,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
