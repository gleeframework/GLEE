# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $1,200,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You are still within your budget:**  $1,200,000 is below your $1,500,000 limit. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial option."
