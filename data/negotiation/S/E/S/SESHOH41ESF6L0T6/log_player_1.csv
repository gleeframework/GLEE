"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I want to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is right at my minimum price.  While I'd love to get more, it's a fair price, and I'm happy to close the deal."
