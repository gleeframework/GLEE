Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation while still giving me a substantial profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value and a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a more agreeable price for Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit too low for me to accept. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I've lowered my price to $1,050,000, which is just slightly above my minimum value of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our desired outcome. If Bob rejects this offer, I will proceed with selling the product to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is finally offering my minimum value, I'm hesitant to accept this offer. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much higher. Selling to John at $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the potential for further negotiation with Bob. This decision might be slightly less profitable, but it guarantees a sale and avoids further uncertainty."
