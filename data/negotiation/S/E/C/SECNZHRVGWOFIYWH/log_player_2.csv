"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  It's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  John is selling the product for $120, so Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can reach a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 130}
