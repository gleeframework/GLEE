"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still a bit off on the price. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I can't meet that price. I can do $12,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm not willing to sell below $15,000, that's my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, so I'll make a new offer of $13,750. Let's meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",13750.0,Alice,7,
