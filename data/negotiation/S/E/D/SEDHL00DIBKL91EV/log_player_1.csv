Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:** $10,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price, but still higher than Bob's value.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately hitting my minimum.
* **Shows flexibility:** I'm not being too aggressive, which could make Bob more likely to engage.

However, I'll keep John's $12,000 offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it shows I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $9,000 is a fair price for me. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident that Bob is willing to negotiate much higher.  John's offer of $12,000 is significantly better and guarantees a higher profit.  I'll take John's offer and end negotiations with Bob."
