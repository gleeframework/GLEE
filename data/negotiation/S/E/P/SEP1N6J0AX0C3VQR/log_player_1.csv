Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think might be of interest to you. I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **Showing flexibility:**  By saying ""I'm open to negotiation"", I signal to Bob that I'm willing to work with him to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Asking for his opinion:** This opens the conversation and encourages Bob to give his perspective on the price, which can give me valuable information about his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, and potentially reach a compromise.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a decent profit, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel comfortable with the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $13,000 is a compromise that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Emphasize value:** I highlight the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Show willingness to negotiate further:** I use phrases like ""What do you think?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage Bob to come back with a counteroffer if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for it. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, accepting his offer allows me to secure a deal with Bob.  There's always the chance we could negotiate a higher price in the future if our relationship develops.
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm willing to take a slight risk for the possibility of a stronger relationship with Bob and potential future business opportunities."
