Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the purchase."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is my initial offer, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down. This leaves me a buffer to potentially still get a better price than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and make him more likely to accept the offer."
