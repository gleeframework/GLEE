Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than he initially thought.  If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer."
