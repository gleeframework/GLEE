Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even if it's just a token amount) and feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose money.

This approach aims for the highest possible profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
