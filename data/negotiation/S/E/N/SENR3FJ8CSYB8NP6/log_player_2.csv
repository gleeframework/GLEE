"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $10,000 is still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000, indicating potential for a compromise. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, aiming to keep the negotiation productive."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise between his previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, making it more likely for Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message remains friendly, keeping the negotiation amicable."
