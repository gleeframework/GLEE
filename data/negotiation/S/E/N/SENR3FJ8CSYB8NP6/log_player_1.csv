"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than Bob's estimated value, making it appealing.  By offering a price and leaving room for counteroffers, I'm inviting Bob to start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than $8,000 from John, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob.  He recognizes the value, and I have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still allows me a good profit while leaving you with a significant saving compared to your estimated value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. He clearly values the product and is willing to negotiate, so I'm going to keep pushing for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference - $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve a good outcome. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
