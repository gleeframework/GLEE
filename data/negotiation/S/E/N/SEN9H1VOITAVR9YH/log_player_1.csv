"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering the value to me, I'm offering $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident that I can get more.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant investment but allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's not miss this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a successful transaction. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Considering the value of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $925,000 is still below my desired price, and we're running out of time.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
