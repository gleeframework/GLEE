"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting your product and the initial offer. While I agree that it holds potential value, the proposed price of $2,300,000 is significantly above what I'm currently prepared to spend. I would be willing to consider purchasing the product for $1,100,000. I believe this offer reflects my genuine interest while recognizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my strong belief in the product while still aiming for a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
