"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay up to $800,000. 
* **It's worth trying to negotiate.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get Alice closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay closer to my own valuation.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're aiming for $800,000, and she's at $950,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left. It's worth trying to see if you can bring her down further.  You might be able to get closer to your target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** You're aiming for $800,000, and she's at $925,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You have 5 rounds left. You might be able to get closer to your target price with a counteroffer. 
* **Consider the risks:**  You have a backup option with John, so you're not in a desperate position. You can afford to be patient and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to offer $910,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. It's a significant move from my last offer, and we're getting closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer of $910,000 is getting closer, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $917,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $917,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $917,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** You only have 3 rounds left. 
* **The gap is still significant:**  While Alice has come down, she's still at $917,500, and you're aiming for $800,000. It's unlikely you'll get her down to your target price in the remaining rounds.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers a deal at your desired price, and it's safer to take that option than to risk losing time and potentially getting a worse deal with Alice. 

It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
