"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can meet you at $110. How about $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112. Let's make this happen,  I think it's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. Can you accept that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I want to make this deal work, I can't go lower than $111. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this, I'm confident you won't regret it!",111.0,Alice,7,
