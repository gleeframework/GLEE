"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he's going to start with a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum budget ($8,000).
* **Reasonable Offer:** $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a decent savings. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. How about $9500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Lower Price:**  Bob has already established a lower price point, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. There's potential for a counteroffer to secure a better price.
* **Saving Money is Key:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasis on Speed:** The message highlights the possibility of a quick deal to incentivize Alice to accept.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This offer keeps Bob within his maximum budget while still showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9250?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Even with Alice's ""middle ground"" offer, $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Risk of Going Over Budget:** Accepting this offer would mean going over budget, which is against Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible.
* **Potential for Lower Price:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still potential for her to come down in price further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  John is still offering the product for $8,000, providing a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. I'm willing to accept that price and move forward."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $9,000. He's shown a willingness to compromise, but he's also holding firm on his budget.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The message emphasizes the finality of the offer, adding pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive to keep the negotiation open and avoid a breakdown.

**Important Note:** Bob is approaching his limit. If Alice rejects this offer, it might be time to consider buying from John to avoid going over budget."
