"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay, there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and a chance to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm ready to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at least at $1150000 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:**  Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the deal falling through. Accepting the current offer is a safe choice that secures a good price."
