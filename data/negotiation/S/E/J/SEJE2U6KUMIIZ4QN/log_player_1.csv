"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We start significantly above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price as linked to the product's ""potential,"" subtly implying there's more value Bob might not be aware of. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it an ""initial proposal,"" we signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to understand Bob's upper limit. This initial offer lets us see if he:
* **Accepts immediately:** He values it much higher than we thought.
* **Counters aggressively:** He's serious and wants a significant price cut. 
* **Counters mildly:** He's interested but wants to negotiate within a smaller range.

We have the John backup, so we can afford to be somewhat bold in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Position:** Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($800,000) but still significantly below our minimum ($1,000,000). This suggests he's willing to negotiate but also trying to anchor the price low.
* **Our Leverage:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum price. This gives us a strong position.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's room to negotiate between $850,000 and $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:**

We'll reject Bob's offer to signal that we're serious about a higher price. Our next counteroffer will aim to bring the negotiation closer to our desired range while keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. However, $850,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Conciliatory:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm on our valuation being higher.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant drop from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000. This shows willingness to negotiate but sets a clear marker above our minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We continue to highlight the ""true value and potential,"" subtly suggesting Bob may be undervaluing it.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Shift the Anchor:** Move the negotiation closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counter.
* **Test Bob's Flexibility:** See if he's willing to move substantially from his initial offer. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  We're still a comfortable distance from both Bob's perceived value and our John backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident in the product's value, but I can only offer $950,000 at this time. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my budget. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Gap Remains:** Bob increased his offer significantly, indicating serious interest. However, $950,000 is still below our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and willing to move. We need to show similar flexibility while pushing for a better deal. 
* **John Option Intact:**  We can still walk away and sell to John at our desired price, giving us leverage.

**Strategy:**

We need to signal that we're getting closer to a deal-breaker point. Our next counteroffer will be above our minimum but with a smaller concession than before, putting pressure on Bob to close the gap substantially."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be straightforward, I need to get at least $1,050,000 for this to work for me. That's a firm price, reflecting the considerable value this product brings. Let me know if we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We use stronger language (""need to get,"" ""firm price"") to signal that we're reaching our limit.
* **Small Concession:** The price drop to $1,050,000 is a relatively small concession, putting pressure on Bob to make a larger move.
* **Value Focus:**  We re-emphasize the ""considerable value"" to justify the higher price and counter any potential arguments based solely on Bob's perceived value.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Test Bob's Resolve:** See if he's willing to cross the $1,000,000 mark to secure the deal.
* **Maintain a Margin:** We're still aiming for a price above our minimum, maximizing potential profit.
* **Prepare for Alternatives:**  If Bob doesn't meet this price, we're prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both getting closer to a deal. I'm prepared to go to $1,000,000, which is the very top of my budget. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Target:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Signals:** His message indicates he's stretched his budget and is highly motivated to close the deal. 
* **Limited Upside:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of alienating Bob and losing the deal entirely. 

**Outcome:** 

By accepting Bob's offer, we achieve our primary goal of selling the product for at least $1,000,000.  This outcome demonstrates successful negotiation, as we secured a price higher than Bob's initial offer while avoiding the need to sell to John."
