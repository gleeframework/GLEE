Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes value to Bob rather than focusing on your minimum price. 
 
**Important Note:** While this is a strong opening offer, be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob rejects the initial offer. You want to find a price he'll accept that's still higher than your $120 guarantee."
