{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above the product's value to me, but I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John.  This gives me flexibility to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than what John is willing to pay.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not going to accept such a low offer without trying to get a better price.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to benefit significantly from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a compromise of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's closer to your original offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get even more, accepting this offer allows me to finalize the deal and secure a profit."
