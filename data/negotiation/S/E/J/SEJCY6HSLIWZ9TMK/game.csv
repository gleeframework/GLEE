"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to benefit significantly from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a compromise of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's closer to your original offer. Can you consider this?",900000.0,Bob,4,
