"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. She might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale."
