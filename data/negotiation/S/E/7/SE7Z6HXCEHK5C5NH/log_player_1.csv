{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to counter and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm confident you'll find this product is well worth it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500. How about we go with $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $8,750 is closer to my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether. It's also a better deal than selling to John."
