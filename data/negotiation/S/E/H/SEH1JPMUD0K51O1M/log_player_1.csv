Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to try and maximize my profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's desire for a lower price while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $130 is still below my threshold. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price of $150. It's not worth risking a lower sale price for the sake of potentially negotiating further with Bob."
