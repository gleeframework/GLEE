"Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's the price I'm willing to sell it for, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
