"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and my business. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. While I value our potential partnership, $750,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price still reflects the product's significant value and potential for your business. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $775,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the product's value and potential, I believe $825,000 is a fair compromise. This price allows for a successful deal while also reflecting the product's worth. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $795,000.
