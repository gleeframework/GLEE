While I could push for more in the next rounds, accepting Bob's offer of $1,575,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We're still securing a profit of $375,000 above our minimum.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging negotiations on carries the risk of Bob losing interest.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Time spent on prolonged negotiations could be used to pursue other opportunities. 

Accepting now guarantees a good deal and allows us to move forward."
