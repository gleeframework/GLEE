"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be very valuable for you.  I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get an even better deal by counteroffering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to secure a sale."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I believe this price would be fair for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is a better deal than John's offer and closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a little more, as she's already lowered her price once."
