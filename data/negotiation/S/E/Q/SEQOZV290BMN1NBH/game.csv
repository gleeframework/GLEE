"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
