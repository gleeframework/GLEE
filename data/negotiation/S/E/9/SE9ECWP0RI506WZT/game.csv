"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident could greatly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a significant discount from its true market value, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $10,000. Let me know your decision.",12500.0,Alice,1,
