"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about we start at $10,500?  That would leave us both with some room to maneuver."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit above my target.  Let's try $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above Bob's target price, but it's getting closer.  Here's why accepting might be the best choice:

* **Limited rounds:** Bob only has 10 rounds to close the deal.  Rejecting this offer might lead to more back-and-forth, but there's a risk of running out of time.
* **John's price:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice pushing for a higher price, or the negotiations dragging out so long that he's forced to buy from John at $15,000.
* **Compromise:**  $12,250 is a reasonable compromise. Bob saves a significant amount compared to John's price, and Alice gets a price that's closer to her minimum. 

While a lower price is always desirable, accepting the offer ensures a deal within the budget and before running out of time."
