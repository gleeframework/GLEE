"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, which encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Plan:**  I'll adjust the price based on Bob's response, aiming to close a deal as close to my minimum $12,000 value as possible.  If we can't reach an agreement, I have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Negotiation:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price by rejecting his counteroffer and making a counteroffer of my own.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation in the hopes of securing a higher price with Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm confident in the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm making a slight counter-offer, moving closer to Bob's offer but not fully meeting it.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining my position.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the higher price point.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By mentioning a ""fair deal"" for both of us, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of equity in the negotiation.
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll have to consider if I want to continue negotiating or go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in Round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit, considering the product's value to me. 

**Conclusion:**  It's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
