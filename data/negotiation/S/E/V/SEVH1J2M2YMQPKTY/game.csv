"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125 for the product? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $125 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you possibly do $115? That would work much better for me.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try $120 for the product. It's a bit closer to your proposed price, while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin.",120.0,Alice,5,
