"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $180. This is a limited-time offer, and I believe it presents a great value for its quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $180 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than my actual upper limit ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is too high.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm also providing a reason for the counteroffer (budget limitations), which can make it more persuasive. 
* **Strategic Goal:** The goal is to secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's $150 offer while leaving room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $125 for the product? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my budget, it's still above my target price. There's room for further negotiation.  I'll try to nudge Alice closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $125 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you possibly do $115? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from $110 to $115 to show Alice I'm willing to compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm continuing to emphasize my budget constraints to keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price.
* **Reaching a Compromise:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that works for both of us. It's close enough to my target price to be acceptable, but still leaves a little room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try $120 for the product. It's a bit closer to your proposed price, while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $120 is a good price for the product. It's significantly less than John's offer of $150 and meets my goal of staying well below my $150 limit.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I continue to push for a lower price, Alice might walk away from the negotiation, and I'd end up having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting the current offer provides a good balance between saving money and moving forward with the purchase."
