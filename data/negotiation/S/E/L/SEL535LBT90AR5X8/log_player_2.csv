"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth no more than $150 to me, and buying it from her for $180 would be too expensive. I will also not buy it from John for $150, because I am trying to save money. I will reject the offer and see if Alice will make a better offer.
