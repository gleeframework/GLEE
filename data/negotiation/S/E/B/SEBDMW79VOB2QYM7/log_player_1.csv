Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,350,000. Can you consider my offer?

While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the potential benefits it holds for you.

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly aware of the product's value and is willing to negotiate fairly. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or losing him as a buyer."
