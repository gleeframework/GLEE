"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $100? I'm willing to pay that price today.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is too low for me. Could you consider $130? I'm trying to find a fair middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I'm really hoping we can find a price we're both happy with.",115.0,Bob,4,
