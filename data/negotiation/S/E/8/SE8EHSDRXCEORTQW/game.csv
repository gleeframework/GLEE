"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business, and I'm happy to discuss this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and it aligns with the value I see in the product for my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $800,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower the price to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution but cannot accept anything below $1,200,000. This revised offer represents a considerable compromise on my end.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
