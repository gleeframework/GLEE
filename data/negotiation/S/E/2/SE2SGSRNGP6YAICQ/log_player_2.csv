# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, as I'm usually selling it for much more. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

You know the product is worth $100 to you, and you can get it from John for that price. Alice's offer of $125 is higher than what you're willing to pay."
