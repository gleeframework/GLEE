Alice is getting closer but $175 is still too high for me. I will reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $165? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $165 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
