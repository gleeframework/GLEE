Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth it to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  It's important to be polite and show confidence in the product's value.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm going to reject it and try to counter with a higher price.  I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum but still a good deal for Bob.  He knows I won't go lower than $15,000, so hopefully this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $16,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum price and a good outcome for me.  Accepting his offer guarantees I get my minimum price without risking further negotiation.  I'm happy to close the deal!"
