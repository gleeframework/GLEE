Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a decision, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product's value to you. I'm offering the product for $815,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, as $815,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point. However, it's only $15,000 more than Bob's last offer.  There are only a few rounds left and buying from John would cost significantly more.  

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product or paying more to John."
