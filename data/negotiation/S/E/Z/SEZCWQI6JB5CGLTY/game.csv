"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I think a more reasonable price would be around $900000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price or slightly above it.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway in the previous round, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, such as a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. I believe this is a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a fair price. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've already compromised on the price and added some valuable perks to the deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.

I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a stalemate.
