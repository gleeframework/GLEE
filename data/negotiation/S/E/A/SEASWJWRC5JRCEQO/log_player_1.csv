""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer.  We'll aim to guide him closer to $1,250,000 - $1,300,000 in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to an acceptable price. However, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a slightly better deal. At this stage, the difference between his offer and our desired price is relatively small, making it worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're very close!  I can see we're both motivated to make this deal happen.  How about we split the difference - $1,250,000, and we close this out?  It's a fair deal for a product you won't regret owning."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has become firm at $1,200,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly. While it's less than we hoped for, it's still a $200,000 profit over John's offer.  It's time to secure the deal rather than risk him walking away entirely."
