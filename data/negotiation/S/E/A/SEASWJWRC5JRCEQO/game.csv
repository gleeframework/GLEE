"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product has tremendous value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're very close!  I can see we're both motivated to make this deal happen.  How about we split the difference - $1,250,000, and we close this out?  It's a fair deal for a product you won't regret owning.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to go. I believe it's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can agree on it.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
