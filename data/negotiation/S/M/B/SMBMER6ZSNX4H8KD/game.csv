"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the potential value of the product, $1600000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $800000. This is my maximum offer, as I can secure the same product elsewhere for this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to consider purchasing the product, but $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $900000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
