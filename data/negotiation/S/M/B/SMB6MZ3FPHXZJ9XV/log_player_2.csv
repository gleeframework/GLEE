{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $12,000 is less than $15,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $15,000 and are getting it for $12,000. 
* **Alice's ""worth"" is irrelevant:** While Alice values the product at $8,000, that's not your concern. Your goal is to get the best deal possible."
