"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a price of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You can always buy from John later if you can't reach a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. I could meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice has shown that she is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save $100,000."
