Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before settling.  $900,000 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $850,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it seems like we're at an impasse. He's unwilling to budge on his offer of $800,000, which is my minimum, but I'm not willing to take such a huge loss. Rather than continuing to negotiate and risk him walking away completely, I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him for $800,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best option available at this point."
