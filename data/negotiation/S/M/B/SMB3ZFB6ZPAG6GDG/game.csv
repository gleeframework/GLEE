"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows me to gain a reasonable return on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise given its value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $850,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $850,000 doesn't quite work for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the immense value this product offers you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
