"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75. How about $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $80? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still looking to get as close to the original price as possible. How about we compromise at $85? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $85. How about $78? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I'm not willing to go above $80.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. How about we compromise at $82? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality.",82.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to make a final push. How about $79? I think this is as low as I can go and still feel good about the deal.",79.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final push, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $79. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $79. How about $80.50? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's quality.",80.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $80. I think that's the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm going to have to think about walking away from the deal if we can't meet on this price.,80.0,Bob,10,
