"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This is a great deal, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and also less than John's offer of $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you money."
