"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
