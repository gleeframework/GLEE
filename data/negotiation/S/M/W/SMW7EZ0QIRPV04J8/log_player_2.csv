"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing its value to *me* (which is lower than Alice's valuation).
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is important throughout the negotiation to encourage continued discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice met me halfway, the price of $900,000 is still significantly higher than my target of $800,000 and John's offer. 
* **Leverage:**  I know Alice is highly motivated to sell. There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down further, especially as I get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($650,000). This strategy shows a willingness to negotiate while still moving toward my target price.
* **Conveying Fairness:**  By suggesting a ""fair compromise,"" I'm framing the offer in a way that encourages Alice to see it as mutually beneficial. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** It's important to keep the negotiation moving forward. This counteroffer keeps the dialogue open and avoids stalling the process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has come down considerably, but her final offer of $850,000 is still above my maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Negotiation:** There's no assurance that Alice would be willing to go any lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at my target price.
* **Securing the Best Deal:** Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees I get the product at the best possible price."
