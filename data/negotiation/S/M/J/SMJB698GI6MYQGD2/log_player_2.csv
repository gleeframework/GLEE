Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,100,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes the most financial sense."
