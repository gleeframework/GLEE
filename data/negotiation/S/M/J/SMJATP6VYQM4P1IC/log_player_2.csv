Round 5
Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still above John's price. While you *might* be able to get her down a little more, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her word and missing out on the guaranteed $15,000 option with John."
