"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so $18,000 is way too much. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
