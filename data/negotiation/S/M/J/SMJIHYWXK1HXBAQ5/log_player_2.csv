"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Buying from Alice for $14,000 is cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer allows him to save $1,000."
