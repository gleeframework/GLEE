Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off. $14,000 leaves a healthy profit margin for you while still being an attractive deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we've started high, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. This offer gives you some wiggle room to potentially settle around $13,000-$13,500.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives us a safety net. If Bob rejects this offer, you're still guaranteed a decent profit."
