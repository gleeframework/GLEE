"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. It's important to remember that my goal is to save as much money as possible.  This low offer serves as a starting point for negotiation and gives me room to increase the price if needed."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  Even though it's closer to my maximum, I'm still going to reject it.  The negotiation is working in my favor, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to go above my budget. I'm hoping that by offering a slightly higher price, I can convince Alice to accept my counteroffer and close the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though she has lowered it.  At this point, the negotiation is not progressing in my favor.  I'm better off buying from John for $1,000,000 and avoid risking further negotiation rounds that could lead to a higher price."
