"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is worth $1,200,000 to me, but I believe we can reach a fair agreement. Would you consider selling your product for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I believe we can still find common ground. Could we agree on $960,000 for the product? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
