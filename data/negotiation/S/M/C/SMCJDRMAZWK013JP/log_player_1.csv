Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me closer to my minimum goal of $1,200,000.  It's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, encouraging him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum goal, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a price point closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to think the negotiation with Bob might drag on. It's becoming clear that Bob won't budge much further. Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
