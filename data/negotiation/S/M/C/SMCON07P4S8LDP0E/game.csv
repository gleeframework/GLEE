"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, we're still pretty far apart on price. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my limit.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we find a middle ground here? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the movement. To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 puts me in a tough position. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but my last offer was a significant concession and reflects the true value of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
