"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning the ""value and potential"" of the product, we're subtly reminding Bob of its worth, even if it's slightly less valuable *to him* at the moment.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals flexibility and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  
 
This first offer allows us to gather information about Bob's position before proceeding with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I understand the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below even his own valuation of the product. While his counteroffer was expected, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. It's strategically better to reject this offer and provide a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value (Again):**  We're subtly reiterating the inherent worth of the product without being too forceful. 
* **Significant Drop, But Not Too Much:** We've dropped our price by $200,000 (showing flexibility), but we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Aiming for Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation towards a price point closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, we're still pretty far apart on price. I can go up to $900,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $900,000 is still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We're making progress, but it's too early to settle. Rejecting his offer and providing another counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to guide the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we find a middle ground here? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** We're explicitly using the phrase ""middle ground"" to signal our intent to find a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Significant Concession:**  By dropping to $1,250,000, we're showing a significant move and placing the offer just above our absolute minimum. This might incentivize Bob to make a more serious offer. 
* **Reiterating Deal-Making:**  We want to remind Bob that our goal is to close a deal and that this offer reflects that commitment.

We're getting closer to a critical point in the negotiation. This offer will likely reveal how motivated Bob is to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement. To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 puts me in a tough position. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking Point:** Bob's message suggests $1,000,000 is a psychological barrier for him, but he's still significantly below our minimum. 
* **Time for a Stronger Stance:** While we want a deal, accepting a loss of $250,000 or more isn't necessary. We have John as a backup, and we've shown significant flexibility.

It's time to signal that our offer in the previous round was serious, and we're not willing to go much lower.  We'll use our next counteroffer to communicate this firmly but respectfully."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but my last offer was a significant concession and reflects the true value of this product. To be transparent, I have other interested buyers.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're clearly stating that the previous offer was our bottom line, but we're doing it without being aggressive.
* **Introducing Competition (Subtly):** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" reminds Bob that we have alternatives without revealing John's specific offer. 
* **Final Compromise:** We're offering a final compromise by splitting the difference between his offer and our previous price. This shows a willingness to close the deal but also sets a firm boundary. 

This counteroffer is designed to elicit Bob's final decision. If he's genuinely interested, this price point is reasonable. If he's not willing to budge, we can confidently move on to John."
