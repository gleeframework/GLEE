Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,900,000), I set a strong anchor point. This can make a slightly lower counter-offer from Bob seem more reasonable.
* **Scarcity:** Emphasizing that other buyers are interested creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,000,000 allows me to be bolder in my negotiation with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
