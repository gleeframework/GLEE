"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
