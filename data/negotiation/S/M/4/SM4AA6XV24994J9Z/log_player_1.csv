"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong anchor point. By setting a high initial price, we leave room for negotiation while aiming for a final price significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though we know Bob values it lower.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message expresses willingness to listen to Bob's perspective, making it clear that this is the opening move in a negotiation, not a final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Above His Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than his stated value of $1,200,000. This indicates room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** We are aiming for at least $1,500,000. Accepting $1,300,000 would leave significant potential profit on the table.
* **Early in Negotiation:** It's only round 2. We have time to counter-offer and explore if we can reach a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you presenting your perspective and offer. While I understand your position, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are moving down from our initial price but making a smaller concession than Bob's initial offer. This signals willingness to negotiate but reinforces the product's high value. 
* **Midpoint Aim:**  We are aiming for a point closer to the middle ground between our starting price and Bob's offer, hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Justification:** We continue to emphasize the product's value without directly referencing his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This shows my serious interest in purchasing the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Goal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better, but it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating his continued interest. There's likely room for further negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of selling to John for our minimum price, giving us leverage to negotiate firmly with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  Let's make this simple: $1,600,000 and I'll agree to the deal today.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product with such potential."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  We're shifting to a more direct approach, indicating we're getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Clear Target:**  By stating a single price, we set a clear target for Bob and signal less flexibility.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're starting to introduce a subtle time constraint by mentioning ""agreeing to the deal today.""
* **Above Minimum, Fair to Bob:** This price ensures we exceed our minimum while still offering Bob a price considerably lower than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has repeated his previous offer and is unlikely to significantly increase it.  
* **Below Minimum:** His offer remains below our absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **John as Guarantee:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob for a lower potential return."
