Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and after careful consideration, I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the value it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage. Starting high allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Understanding Value:** Both you and Bob value the product at $1,000,000. This means there's potentially a ""surplus"" value to be negotiated â€“ Bob would benefit significantly if he gets it for less than $1,800,000, and you'd profit beyond your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high price provides room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can then work towards a mutually agreeable figure. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** While this is an aggressive opening offer, be prepared to negotiate. If Bob outright rejects it, you can always adjust your price closer to $1,000,000 knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
