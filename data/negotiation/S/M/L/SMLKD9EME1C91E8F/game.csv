"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to purchase it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I can meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $165 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle on $145? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
