"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great value and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) as it allows for more room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to discussing the price, setting the stage for a negotiation. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  This offer provides a good starting point for a negotiation while keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer shows his interest in the product, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **Avoiding Loss:** Accepting his offer at this point would result in a loss compared to my minimum acceptable price and would potentially limit my earning potential.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, leaving some space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still represents a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Reason:** I'm offering a price that's a step closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Acknowledge Budget Concerns:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns, showing that I'm open to negotiation but also emphasizing the product's value.
* **""Great Deal"" Framing:** I highlight the value of the product by framing my offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I conclude with an invitation to find common ground, showing flexibility and willingness to reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1700000, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1650000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  With only 6 rounds left, there's limited time to continue negotiating. Further haggling might risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **Potential for Loss:** Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to further counteroffers, potentially pushing the price down even lower. Accepting this offer secures a sale that's only slightly below my ideal price.

**Conclusion:** While it's not my dream price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the sale and guarantees a substantial profit within the remaining rounds."
