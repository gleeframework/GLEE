"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product.
