Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm willing to consider his counteroffer, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but it's still a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my minimum value that I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for $12,000 isn't worth the potential for a prolonged negotiation or a lower price."
