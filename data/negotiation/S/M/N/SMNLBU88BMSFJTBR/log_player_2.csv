"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than your desired price. You can try to get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, it's getting close to your deadline, and you're unlikely to get a significantly lower price from Alice. It's best to secure the product from John for $8,000. You'll save money and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
