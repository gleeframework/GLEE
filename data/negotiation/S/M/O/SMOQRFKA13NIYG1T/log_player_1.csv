Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $105. This price would still allow you to make a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
