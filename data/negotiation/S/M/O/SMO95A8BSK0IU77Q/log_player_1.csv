Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a unique opportunity to acquire it at a price below your own valuation."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I have a significant advantage knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, maximizing my profit while still ensuring a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still keeping me well above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup ensures I won't be forced to go below my $800,000 minimum."
