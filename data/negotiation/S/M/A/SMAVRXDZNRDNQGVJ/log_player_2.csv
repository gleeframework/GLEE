"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,200,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. After careful consideration, I propose to sell this product to you at a special introductory price of $1,150,000. This offer represents an exceptional value, allowing you to secure this remarkable asset at a discount compared to its true worth. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While she's offering a ""discount,"" the price is still higher than your maximum budget and significantly higher than what it's worth to her. There's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're aware the price is too high. She may come back with a lower offer closer to her actual valuation. Even if she doesn't, you're still within your budget to buy from John."
