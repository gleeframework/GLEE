"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Language:**  Using positive language like ""amazing"" and ""really enjoy"" can help build rapport and make Bob more interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Stating that I'm ""open to negotiation"" shows flexibility and makes Bob feel like he has some control in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate you offering this [product description] to me.  $200 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to hold out for a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal. 
* **John is a backup:**  While John is willing to pay $150, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before settling for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but staying open to negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:** My counteroffer of $175 is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also protecting my interests. 
* **Positive Tone:** I use positive language like ""good deal"" and ""Let me know what you think"" to maintain a friendly tone and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $150?  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has clearly stated this is his final offer.  
* **No Time to Waste:**  I don't want to risk Bob changing his mind or walking away.  While John is a safe option, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids potential delays."
