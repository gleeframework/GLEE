Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives Bob room to negotiate and hopefully allows for a profitable deal, but still protects my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating flexibility and showing willingness to meet halfway, I can incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's significantly better than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential further lowering of the price."
