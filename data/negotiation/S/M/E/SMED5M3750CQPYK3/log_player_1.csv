Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob.  It gives him room to negotiate, but also allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $100.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise between my initial price of $120 and Bob's offer of $90.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
