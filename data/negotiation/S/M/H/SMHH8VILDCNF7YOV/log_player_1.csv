"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and inviting message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open Ended Question:** The open-ended question invites Bob to respond and hopefully counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or by selling to John. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price and keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** Highlighting the ""meeting in the middle"" aspect suggests a fair and mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still room for further negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to engage with Bob or by selling to John. 
* **Strategic Value:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and demonstrate my commitment to obtaining a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm again offering a compromise, this time splitting the difference between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Positive and Urgent Tone:** The message is enthusiastic and emphasizes a sense of finality, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the idea of a ""fair price"" for both parties, further incentivizing Bob to accept."
