Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. He might be willing to pay a premium over his perceived value ($100) to secure what he might see as a deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit."
