"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to say that $9500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11200.0,Alice,9,
