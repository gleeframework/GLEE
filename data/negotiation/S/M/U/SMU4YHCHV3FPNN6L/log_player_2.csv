"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $13,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a starting point for negotiation, and you're still willing to walk away if Alice won't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's getting closer to your budget, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still not there. You're confident you can get a lower price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
You're getting closer to your target price and want to see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

You're getting closer to your target price, but you can still get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

You're aiming for a middle ground, hoping Alice will be willing to compromise a little further to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You're very close to your target price and there's a chance Alice might not budge further.  While $9,750 is slightly higher than your ideal, it's still a good deal and you're likely to get a better price than what John is offering. There's also a risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John, so accepting the offer is the best choice at this point."
