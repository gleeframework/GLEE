"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I want to leave room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much at the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $13,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I will reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from $13,000 to $11,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above Bob's offer,  showing that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired value.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. I will reject his offer and try to counter-offer with a price closer to my acceptable range. I still have time and can potentially get a better price or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, showing flexibility, but I'm still above Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale. $10,500 is a good compromise point, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value.  This might encourage him to come closer to my desired price range. If it doesn't, I can always sell to John in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable range, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and  not significantly higher than his previous offer. I'm not desperate for a sale and have time to negotiate further. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable price. I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my last offer to show flexibility, while still aiming for a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from $10,500 to $10,000, again demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above Bob's offer, showing that I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to a mutually acceptable price.  I'm still considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that's too low. I will reject his offer and try to counter-offer with a price closer to my acceptable range.  I still have time and can potentially get a better price or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $9,750, which is a small compromise but still above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  We're getting close to a potential deal, and I want to give Bob one more chance to come up a little bit before I consider selling to John. If this offer is rejected, I'll likely go with John in the final round."
