"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",810000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. It's the best I can do, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  If you're not able to meet that price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. ",850000.0,Alice,5,
