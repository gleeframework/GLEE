"Hello Bob, I'm excited to talk about selling this product to you. I think it could be incredibly valuable for your needs.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,100,000.  Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we might have different valuations for this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what I consider fair value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down.  However,  $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. My absolute limit is $1,200,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, but I won't be able to go any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
