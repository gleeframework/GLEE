# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to talk about selling this product to you. I think it could be incredibly valuable for your needs.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we might have different valuations for this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far off from what I consider fair value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work for you, I might have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
