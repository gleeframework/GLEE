{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit, while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($20). This price point increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John if Bob declines.

By starting with this strong opening offer, you set the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
