Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm still significantly below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before I have to resort to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $940,000? This price is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiation and Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident that I can secure a better price with Bob.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 offer from John."
