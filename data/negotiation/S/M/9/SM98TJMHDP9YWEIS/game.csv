"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $1800000. This is a fair market value considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this product. I'm open to negotiating further if you are willing to consider my offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $1400000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product for $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering your budget. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
