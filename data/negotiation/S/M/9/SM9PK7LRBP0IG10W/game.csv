"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $650,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $975,000? This reflects the significant value this product offers.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me partway. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $725,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true worth.",900000.0,Alice,5,
