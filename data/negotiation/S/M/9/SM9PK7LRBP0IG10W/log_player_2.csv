Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $650,000."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $650,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we consider $975,000? This reflects the significant value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $725,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $900,000 is her final offer.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and we're still significantly above John's offer of $800,000.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice when we have a guaranteed option to buy at a lower price from John."
