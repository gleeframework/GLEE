"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which would still be a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves significant profit for you. This is my final offer, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
