"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and gives you a substantial profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Bob needs to negotiate a lower price to maximize his savings. 
* **There's time:**  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which would still be a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves significant profit for you. This is my final offer, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget:**  $1,350,000 is below Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **A good deal:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer still saves him $150,000 compared to buying from John."
