"Bob, I understand you value the product at $900,000.  However, I'm not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a good profit for me, while also reflecting the value you've identified.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
