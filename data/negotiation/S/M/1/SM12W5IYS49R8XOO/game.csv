,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500. How about $8,750? I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,750 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, but this time between $8,750 and my last offer of $9,500. How about $9,125? This feels like a fair price for both of us to consider. What do you think?",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,6,
