``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and potential compromise.

* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, showing that I'm open to discussing the price and potentially finding a mutually agreeable solution."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe it's a good price considering the value you're offering, but I'd like to see some more flexibility from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I want to try and negotiate a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left to reach a deal.  

* **Reasoning:**
    * I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000 and there's potential for a higher price. 
    * I'm not in a rush to sell and can afford to continue negotiating.
    * By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to push for a better price, which might encourage Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will carefully consider Bob's arguments and propose a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but more attractive to him than my initial offer."

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm willing to meet you at $1325000, but I need to know that this is the final offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Bob is clearly not going to budge much further. While his offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value. Accepting his offer is the best course of action for a few reasons:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate further could result in no deal at all, leaving me with the lower price from John ($1,200,000).
* **Time Pressure:** This is the final round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Slight Gain:** Accepting Bob's offer still results in a profit over my minimum acceptable value, and it's better than walking away with nothing. 

While I might prefer a higher price, I need to weigh the risks and make a decision based on the available information and the limited time. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures I don't walk away empty-handed."
