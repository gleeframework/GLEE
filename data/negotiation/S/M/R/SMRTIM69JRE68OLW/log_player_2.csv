"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest a price of $110 for it. This price not only reflects its worth but also provides you with a reasonable saving compared to its market value. I trust you'll find this offer compelling and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is less than John's price of $120, it's still above your $120 limit. There's a chance Alice might be open to further negotiation if you reject this initial offer."
