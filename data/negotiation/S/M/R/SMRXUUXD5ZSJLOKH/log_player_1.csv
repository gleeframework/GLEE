Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's potential for a higher sale price.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob before moving to your backup option.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net with John. However, being too greedy could make Bob walk away.  Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value-Focused:** Highlighting the product's benefits keeps the focus on its worth, not just the price.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing you a significant profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to buy."
