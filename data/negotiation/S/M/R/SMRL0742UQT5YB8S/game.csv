"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",7000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $6500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6900. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $400.",6900.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $6900 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $6700?  This would split the difference between our last offers and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",6700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6700. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $6850. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",6850.0,Alice,5,
