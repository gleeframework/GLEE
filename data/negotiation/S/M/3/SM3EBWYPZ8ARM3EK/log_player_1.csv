Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I hint at the product's value to Bob without revealing my hand. This creates a sense of potential and exclusivity.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages a response and opens the door for further discussion or a counter-offer from Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while securing a sale. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate down, knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000."
