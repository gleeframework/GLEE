I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. This allows for negotiation and gives me room to make concessions later if needed."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is the best offer I've received so far. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to it and still significantly higher than selling to John. With only two rounds left, it's likely that I won't be able to get a better offer, and it's important to secure a sale."
