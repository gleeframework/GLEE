{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Starting with a lower counteroffer shows your intent to negotiate seriously and creates space for a compromise. 
* **Consideration of Alice's Value:** This price is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice, leaving room for a profitable deal for both of you.
* **Room for Compromise:** This counteroffer provides ample room for negotiation in the following rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet Alice halfway. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, but still leaves a small margin of profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, there's a need to reach a deal. This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
* **Risk Assessment:** If Alice rejects this offer, it might be time to move on to John. However, this counteroffer gives Alice one last opportunity to come to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out.**  This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's only slightly lower than her previous offer, and we are unlikely to get a much better deal in the remaining time.
* **John's offer is the safest option.** While it's not ideal, it guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a deal falling through with Alice. 

It's important to weigh the potential for further negotiation with Alice against the risk of not securing the product at all. In this scenario, buying from John is the most sensible decision given the limited time and Alice's reluctance to lower her price significantly."
