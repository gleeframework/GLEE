Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you for $18,000.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Create a Sense of Scarcity:**  Mentioning that this is an exclusive offer before you offer it to others can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and encourage him to act quickly. 
* **Justify the Price:** While Bob might not value the product at $18,000, framing your price as reflective of its ""unique value"" can make it seem more reasonable. 

**Important Note:** It's essential to gauge Bob's reactions. If he seems hesitant at $18,000, you have room to negotiate down towards $15,000, ensuring you still make a profit."
