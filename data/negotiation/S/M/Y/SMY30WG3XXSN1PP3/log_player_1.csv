Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $8,000 for it. This is my maximum budget for this purchase. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is equal to my minimum value for the product.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a missed opportunity to sell to John."
