"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good starting point. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's immediately rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is way too low for me. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still higher than my minimum of $15,000 but shows I'm willing to be flexible. I hope this price is attractive enough to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I'm not in a rush, and I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I have a few more rounds to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still above my minimum and hoping that Bob will finally come around. I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm feeling the pressure.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe bet and guarantees I'll get my minimum. I'm taking the guaranteed deal and selling to John."
