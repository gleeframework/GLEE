Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm going to start with a lowball offer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to my budget.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $12,000.  I'll try one more counteroffer before I move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about getting a deal, but if she doesn't, I'm ready to move on to John."
