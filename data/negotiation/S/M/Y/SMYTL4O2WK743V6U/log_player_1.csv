Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you're getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still some space for Bob to negotiate down without making it feel like you're giving away too much.
* **It reflects the product's value to Bob:**  It's significantly less than the $1,000,000 value to Bob, making the offer attractive. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to counteroffer or accept Bob's counteroffers if necessary. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly less than the $950,000 you initially offered. You're in a strong position because Bob clearly recognizes the product's value to him.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:** You're willing to walk away if you don't get a price closer to your desired range.
* **Force Bob to come closer to your price:** He's shown he's willing to negotiate, and you're likely to get a better price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price between $850,000 and $950,000. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also sets a clear expectation for the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to a quick resolution. It shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests.
* **Focus on fairness:**  The message emphasizes fairness and a win-win situation.  This helps to build a positive relationship with Bob. 
* **Reinforcing your value:**  While you're willing to come down, you're still holding firm to a price that reflects the product's worth.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  Pay attention to his language and how he responds to your counteroffer. This will give you insights into his willingness to negotiate further.
* **Be prepared to adjust:** You might need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response.  If he's adamant about a lower price, you might consider offering a small discount to seal the deal. But remember, you're still aiming for a price closer to your ideal target."
