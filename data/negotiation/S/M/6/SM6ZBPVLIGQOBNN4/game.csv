"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant step towards your price.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",12000.0,Bob,4,
