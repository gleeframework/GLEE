"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to create a good atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make him more interested. 

This approach aims to get the best possible price while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm also setting the stage for a potential counteroffer, which is a key part of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** While $90 is not ideal, it's still closer to my minimum than what John is offering.  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to work with you on a price.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $95. 
* **Maintain Margin:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging.

By counteroffering at $95, I'm hoping to meet Bob's budget while still securing a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  There's not much room for me to negotiate further with Bob, and his continued low offers suggest he's unlikely to come up significantly.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a guaranteed profit.

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100, so I'm choosing to **SellToJhon** to secure the best possible outcome."
