"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I've already compromised a bit by coming down to $82.50. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $70, which would be $76.25. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",76.25,Alice,5,
