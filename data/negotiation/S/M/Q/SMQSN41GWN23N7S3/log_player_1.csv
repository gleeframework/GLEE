Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer gives Bob room to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counter-offer is too low, don't be afraid to walk away and sell to John. You have a strong fallback option!"
