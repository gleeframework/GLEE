Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($120) to maximize my profit.
* **Reasonable margin:**  $115 leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Open communication:**  The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can come to an agreement at $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's clearly interested in the product. This indicates there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a higher price. 
* **Alternative option:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable value. However, I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Final offer:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" adds a sense of urgency and might incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Clear communication:**  The message is direct and clearly outlines the offer, making it easy for Bob to understand."
