"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I can move it quickly. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as you'd still make a profit and I'd get a valuable asset at a price I can afford.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what I could get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering what I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
