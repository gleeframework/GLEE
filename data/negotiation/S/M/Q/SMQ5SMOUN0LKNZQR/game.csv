"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still only able to offer $10,750 at this point. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,
