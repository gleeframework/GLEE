# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, it's still a bit high.  Rejecting the offer again allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his goal of $10,500."
