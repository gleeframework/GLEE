"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a great starting point. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking of a higher price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's a significant discount from the original $12,000 price and still below Bob's maximum budget. It's also a good compromise from Alice's previous offer, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer will secure the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation or potentially paying the full $12,000 to John."
