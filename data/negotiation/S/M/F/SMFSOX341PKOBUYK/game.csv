"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $7,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",7000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $6,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also showing that I'm willing to negotiate.",6200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $6,200 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to settle at $5,600?",5600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,600. I can offer you a compromise at $6,000. This is still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",6000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $6,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",6100.0,Alice,7,
