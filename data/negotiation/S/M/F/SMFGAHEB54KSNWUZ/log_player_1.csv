**Reasoning:** 

Bob has made it clear he's aiming for a price significantly lower than your minimum. His latest offer is a substantial drop and shows he's not negotiating in good faith towards your acceptable range.  It's unlikely he'll meet your minimum in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
