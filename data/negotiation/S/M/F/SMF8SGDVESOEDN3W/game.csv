"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe this product is worth a good deal, but I'm not willing to pay the full $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable paying $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,000 and $10,000, which would be $8,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",8000.0,Bob,4,
