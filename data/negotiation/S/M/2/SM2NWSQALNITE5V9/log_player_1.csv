Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $115 is still below my minimum. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $120.  Would you consider $125?
