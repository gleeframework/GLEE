"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $120 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $130? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $120.  Would you consider $125?  This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",125.0,Alice,5,
