Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  Offering it at $1,400,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John provides a safety net. You can confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $1,400,000, there might be a small margin for negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy maximizes your chances of a profitable deal."
