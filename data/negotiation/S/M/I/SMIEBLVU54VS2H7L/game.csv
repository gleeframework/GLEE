"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 would be fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial offer reflected the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,025,000. I'd like to propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While I value finding common ground, I believe the product's inherent worth warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I've given this offer considerable thought, and to be completely transparent, $950,000 is cutting it too close to what I can accept. This product is a unique opportunity, and I wouldn't be able to part with it for anything less than $980,000. This is my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a premium price, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. My final offer is $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,8,
