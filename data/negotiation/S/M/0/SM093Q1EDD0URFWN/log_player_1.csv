"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more if I continue negotiating.  I'll see what counteroffer he makes in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $1,500 above my minimum and we're only in round 4. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation that could end with me selling to John for $15,000."
