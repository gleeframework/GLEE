"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,750. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be incredibly valuable. Let's close this deal!",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and make a counteroffer of $7,900. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",7900.0,Bob,6,
