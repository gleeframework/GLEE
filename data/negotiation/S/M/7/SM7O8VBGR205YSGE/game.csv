"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
