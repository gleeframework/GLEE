"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500? I'm keen to get this deal done, and I think this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
