"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is too high. It leaves very little room for negotiation below your $1,000,000 limit. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price and initiate the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Ambitious but realistic:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, aiming to bring the price closer to your target. However, it's not so low as to be insulting or unrealistic.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By starting significantly lower, you give yourself room to negotiate upwards during subsequent rounds.
* **Expresses interest:**  The message reaffirms your interest in the product, making it clear you're not trying to lowball Alice but are serious about finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value I see in the product."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic concession:**  You are moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for your target.
* **Focus on value:**  Instead of just haggling over price, you are reiterating the value you see in the product, justifying your offer. 
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** You are still below your $1,000,000 limit, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting close to your limit, but she has now given herself very little wiggle room. You're in a strong position to push for a price closer to $1,000,000, especially since she explicitly said she's open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500? I'm keen to get this deal done, and I think this price represents a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1012500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a split of the difference, you signal a strong willingness to close the deal while staying above your absolute limit. This approach can be very effective in breaking a deadlock.
* **Sense of Urgency:** You're indicating that you're eager to reach an agreement, subtly increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a price close to your target.
* **Positioning:** This counteroffer is very close to your limit, giving you a little room to concede a tiny bit more if necessary, while still achieving a significant saving compared to Alice's previous offer and your fallback option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,015,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has now given a very strong signal that she won't go lower. She has explicitly stated this is her final offer. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price only slightly above your absolute limit ($15,000 over) and avoids the risk of missing out entirely. While you could try to push further, it's unlikely you'll get a better price from Alice, and you risk jeopardizing the deal."
