"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering $175 earlier. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. How about we meet at $170? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
