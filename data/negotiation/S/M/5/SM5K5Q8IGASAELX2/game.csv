"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $850,000?  This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates my serious interest in closing the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
