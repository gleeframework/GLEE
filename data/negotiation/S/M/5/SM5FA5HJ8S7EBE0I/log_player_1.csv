Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering a price slightly below John's offer might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $150 immediately might make Bob think I'm desperate and unwilling to negotiate. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
