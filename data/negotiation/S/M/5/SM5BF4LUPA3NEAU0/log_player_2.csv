"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is willing to sell it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open and doesn't cost you anything."
