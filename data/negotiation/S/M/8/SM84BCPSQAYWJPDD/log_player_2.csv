(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're trying to save money, so rejecting the first offer makes sense.  You can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save money, and $95 is closer to your goal, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $92?  That's closer to my budget, and hopefully, we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $93, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've already negotiated the price down significantly. While you'd love to save another dollar, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  Accepting the offer at $93 is a good deal, and you'll save money compared to buying from John."
