Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
