Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I've chosen a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my own. This gives me room to negotiate if he counteroffers. 

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **It's a strong opening:** It shows that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not giving away the farm.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, I have some space to lower the price while still maximizing my profit.
* **It's not too aggressive:** I'm not going to scare Bob off with an outrageous price right away.

However, the ideal strategy will depend on how much I'm willing to compromise and how confident I am in my ability to get a better offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm choosing to counteroffer at $950,000 for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** I'm coming down from my original price, but not too far.
* **It's still profitable:** I'm still getting more than Bob's initial offer, and I'm closer to my desired price.
* **It's a good starting point for further negotiation:** I'm leaving some room for further compromise if necessary, but I'm also not giving away too much. 

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than I'd prefer, it's very close to my desired price point, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Time is money:**  The longer I negotiate, the more risk there is that Bob will walk away, or I could miss out on other opportunities.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob won't counteroffer again, or his next offer might be even lower.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is more lucrative, I'm comfortable with the $925,000 offer. This deal is still very profitable and will allow me to move on to other ventures.

It's always a gamble in negotiation, but in this case, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
