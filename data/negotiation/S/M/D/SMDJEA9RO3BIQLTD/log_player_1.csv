"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a little closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $9,200?  I think this price still represents a great deal for you and allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below your target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can secure a higher price by making another counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can get him to budge just a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? I think this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is only slightly below my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation. It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the most sensible option at this point. It ensures I don't lose more time with Bob and still meet my minimum profit requirement."
