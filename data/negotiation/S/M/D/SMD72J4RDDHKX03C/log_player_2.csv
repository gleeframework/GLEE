{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You can potentially get the product for cheaper than $9,000. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test her willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to dropping the price.  It's important to start with a lower price as it gives room for compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $12,000.  I have rounds remaining and can continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to accept her price.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$8,100 is still a bit high, but I'm getting closer to my target price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get it even lower. There are still a few rounds remaining, and I'm optimistic about reaching a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7900}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by only a small amount. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also shows Alice that I'm not going to significantly raise my offer.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as we're getting very close to finding a middle ground. If she doesn't, I'm still within my budget and can continue negotiating in the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the last round where I can negotiate with Alice. While $8,050 is still a bit higher than I'd like, it's very close to my target price. I'm confident I can't get a lower price from Alice, and if I reject the offer, I'll be forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price. Accepting the offer now ensures I get the product within my budget."
