Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, accepting Alice's offer saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is always a possibility, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further outweighs the potential gain of a few more thousand dollars."
