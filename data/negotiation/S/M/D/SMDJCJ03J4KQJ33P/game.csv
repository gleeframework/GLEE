"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I've got a budget I need to stick to.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While $85 is a little lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $95? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let's make this work!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
