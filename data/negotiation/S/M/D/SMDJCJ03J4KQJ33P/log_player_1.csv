{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product and maximized my profit.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price ($120) and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I've got a budget I need to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing $35 compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob expressed interest in the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will propose a price higher than $85 but lower than $120. I'll try to find a middle ground that's appealing to Bob while still protecting my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While $85 is a little lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $95? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $95, which is a middle ground between my initial offer ($100) and Bob's counteroffer ($85). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and emphasizing that $95 is a ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Appeal to Interest:** I'm reminding Bob of his expressed interest in the product to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my desired range.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price ($120) and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum desired price of $120, but it's significantly closer than his previous offer of $85.
* **Potential for Profit:** While not ideal, accepting this offer would still result in a profit, which is better than no sale.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a further counteroffer from me, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Consideration:** Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process, and I might miss out on other potential buyers.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to Bob:** By accepting Bob's offer, I'll secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
