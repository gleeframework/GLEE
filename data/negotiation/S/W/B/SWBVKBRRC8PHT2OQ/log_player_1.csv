"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is too low. Let's aim for something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit below your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer.  $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000. It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate and is serious about buying the product."
