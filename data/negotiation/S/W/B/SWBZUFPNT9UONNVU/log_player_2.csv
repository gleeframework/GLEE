"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the price at $16,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $16,000 is significantly above his budget of $10,000.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $16,000 represents the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step in the right direction, $14,500 is still more than he's willing to spend. He should counteroffer again in the next round, trying to get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $11,500.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
