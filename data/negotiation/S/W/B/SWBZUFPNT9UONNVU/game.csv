"Alice, $16,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $16,000 represents the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $11,500.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
