"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer. However, $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I hope this is a price we can agree on.",15000.0,Bob,6,
