"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I can always go with John's deal for $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,120,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional features and support. I think it's worth considering, especially given the potential benefits the product can bring to your business.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
