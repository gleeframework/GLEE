"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the highest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,5,
