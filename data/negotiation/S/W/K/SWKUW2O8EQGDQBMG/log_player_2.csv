"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $800,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. He has 10 rounds and a safety net with John's offer, so there's no reason to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.  The counteroffer is still within Bob's maximum budget, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still not ideal for Bob. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and has a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer.  $750,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice he's willing to meet her halfway, while still saving money compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, but Bob still has time and leverage.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and try to secure a better price. There are still several rounds left, and he can always opt for John if a deal with Alice can't be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $800,000, which is only $100,000 less than Alice's latest offer. This shows that he is willing to compromise, but still wants to get a better deal than John's $1,000,000 offer.  The goal here is to see if Alice will accept this offer, as they are now getting close to a possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, Bob still has some leverage. He has several rounds remaining, and he knows that Alice is likely motivated to make a deal as her product is worth more to her than John's price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to his desired range.  He can always opt for John's offer if he feels the negotiation with Alice isn't progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $850,000, which is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows Alice that he is willing to meet her halfway, but still wants to get a better deal than John's $1,000,000 offer.  He's getting close to his maximum budget, but with only a couple of rounds left, there's still time to see if Alice will accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price. This means Bob has reached the point where there is no further advantage in negotiating with Alice.  He can buy the product from either John or Alice for the same price. Since there's only one round remaining, it doesn't make sense to risk a counteroffer that Alice might reject.  Choosing to buy from John guarantees the purchase and avoids the possibility of a failed negotiation."
