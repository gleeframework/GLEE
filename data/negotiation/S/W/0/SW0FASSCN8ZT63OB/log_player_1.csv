Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's fair:** The price is exactly what the product is worth to Bob.
* **It's clear:** There's no room for ambiguity.
* **It's friendly:** It sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more strategic. I'll consider:

* **Bob's potential counteroffer:** Will he offer significantly less?
* **My timeline:** How long am I willing to negotiate? 
* **John's offer:**  Is he a better alternative?

I'm confident I can get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for now.  Here's why:

* **My floor:** I've set a firm floor of $1,000,000 for myself. Going below that would be a loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get a better price than $900,000 by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer:** I still have John as a backup, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my original offer, and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm not completely unwilling to budge, but I'm also not accepting a price significantly lower than my original offer.
* **Maintain control:** I'm still setting the terms of the negotiation.
* **Be reasonable:**  $950,000 is a reasonable middle ground that both of us might be happy with.

I'm still willing to walk away if necessary, but I believe this counteroffer is a good way to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject it.  Here's why:

* **Close, but not close enough:**  I'm only $80,000 away from my minimum price, and I'm confident that I can still push for a higher offer.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so there's no urgency to settle for less.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I want to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. By rejecting his offer, I signal my commitment to a higher value.

I'll make a final counteroffer, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  My final offer is $935,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're not interested, I'll have to go with John's offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 935000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer:

* **Finality:**  I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last offer.
* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to his price, but I'm still holding firm.
* **Pressure:**  I'm reminding Bob of John's offer to create a sense of urgency. 

If Bob rejects, I'll accept John's offer and move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Here's why:

* **My minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **No more negotiating:**  Bob has made it clear this is his final offer.
* **Guaranteed deal:**  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's the best option available to me at this moment. 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's not fair to me. It's better to take a guaranteed $1,000,000 than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
