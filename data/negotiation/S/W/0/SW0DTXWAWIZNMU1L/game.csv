"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500. This price still offers a good value for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still slightly outside my budget. I can offer $11000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. It's a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach a final agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
