"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value our potential partnership, I'm unable to accept your current offer.  The product's unique capabilities and value justify a higher price.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's keep the conversation going.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
