"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above my limit of $1,000,000. I have room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a range that feels reasonable considering the value of the product to her and to me.  I'm aiming to find a price that bridges the gap between our valuations, while also leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my $1,000,000 limit.  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue bargaining and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to move but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to accept her offer.  This counteroffer is still within my limit, but close enough to her offer that I'm hoping we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. We've both moved closer to a middle ground, and I think there's a possibility that Alice might be willing to lower her offer slightly further. By rejecting her offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a price closer to my limit. This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's most recent offer, signaling that I'm willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but Alice is still above my target price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we're not making significant progress and that I might not reach a deal within the remaining rounds.  To avoid the risk of missing out on the product altogether, I'll accept John's offer and purchase the product from him for $1,000,000."
