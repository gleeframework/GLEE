{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a positive and enticing opportunity, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to accept. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Balance:** It strikes a balance between maximizing profit and encouraging negotiation.
* **Flexibility:**  Leaving room for counteroffers allows me to adjust my price based on Bob's response and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your value for the product, but I believe I can only pay $9500 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. 
* **John is a strong backup:** I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have John as a guaranteed buyer for a much higher price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer to bridge the gap and try to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our discussion, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while also asserting my worth. 
* **Compromise:**  $11,000 is a significant compromise compared to my initial offer of $12,000. This shows good faith and encourages Bob to consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable point.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still firm on my minimum value, but I'm showing flexibility to encourage a deal. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Remembering that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $10500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I'm not completely satisfied with Bob's offer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to try one more time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John is my safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. This will be my final attempt to reach a deal before I sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still below my minimum value. I'm willing to make one final compromise - I'll accept $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and our ongoing discussions. If this doesn't work, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final concession to demonstrate my willingness to close the deal, but I'm still holding firm to a price above my minimum. 
* **Clear Deadline:** I'm setting a clear deadline by mentioning that I'll have to move forward with another buyer if we don't reach an agreement. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider my offer.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as fair to both parties, highlighting the value of the product and our negotiation history. 

**Strategy:**

* **High Stakes:** This counteroffer puts the ball in Bob's court. He needs to decide if he wants to accept the offer or risk losing the product to another buyer.
* **Maximizing Potential:**  $11,500 is the highest price I'm willing to accept, so if Bob rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John. 
* **Closing the Deal:** My aim is to close the deal at a price that's both acceptable to me and potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can only afford to pay $11000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No further negotiation:**  Bob's final offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  There's no more room for negotiation. 
* **John is the better option:** I've already made several concessions to try and reach a deal with Bob, but it's clear we're at an impasse. Selling to John for $15,000 is the best decision for me financially.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would only waste time and potentially lead to a lower price. 

I'm confident that selling to John is the best option in this situation. I'll move forward with the sale and finalize the deal."
