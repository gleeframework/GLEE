"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  Could you do $18,000? I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
