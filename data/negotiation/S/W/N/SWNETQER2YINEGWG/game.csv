"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
