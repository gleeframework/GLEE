"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,200,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so even at $1,200,000 you're saving $300,000."
