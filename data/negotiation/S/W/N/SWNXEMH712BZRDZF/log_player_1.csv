"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value.  This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe Bob is willing to pay more. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.  This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, making it a more attractive alternative to his current proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe we can still do better.  I'm rejecting his offer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident we can work out a deal that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, it's not guaranteed I can achieve a better deal.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and closes the deal."
