**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, but it's still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can bring the price down further.  I'm confident I can convince Alice to drop the price closer to my ideal point of $1,250,000."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still slightly above my budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection is high. John's offer of $1,200,000 is a guaranteed deal at a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to take the safe option and buy from John."
