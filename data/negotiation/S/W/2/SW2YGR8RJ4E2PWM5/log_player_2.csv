"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, you can still save money by rejecting and making a counteroffer. You know the product is worth $8,000 to you, so aim for a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's $10,000 offer and still leaves some room for negotiation. This price is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still higher than my maximum price of $8,000. I will reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,500. This price demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is becoming increasingly inflexible, and her latest offer of $9,800 is too close to my maximum budget. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John.  The potential savings of a few hundred dollars are not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
