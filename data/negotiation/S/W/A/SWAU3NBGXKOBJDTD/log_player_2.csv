"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now offering it for $110.
* **You're saving money.**  You're getting the product for $110 instead of the original $120.
* **The negotiation is likely to continue.** While you could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal. Accepting her offer is a good compromise."
