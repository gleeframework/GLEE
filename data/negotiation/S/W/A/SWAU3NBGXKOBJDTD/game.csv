"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
