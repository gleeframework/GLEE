Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's less than what I'd get from another buyer, but it's still a significant profit for me. You'd be getting a product worth $800,000 to you for a much lower price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've set the price at $1,400,000. This is a significant discount for Bob, making the offer attractive. However, it's still a profit for me, as I would get $1,500,000 from John if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value for both parties. It highlights the potential savings for Bob and the fact that I'm willing to make a concession. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer:** The attractive price makes it more likely for Bob to say yes.
* **Maximize my profit:**  While I'm taking a small hit compared to John's offer, it's still a significant profit and ensures a quicker sale."
