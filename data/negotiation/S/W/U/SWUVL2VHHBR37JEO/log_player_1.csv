"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further, and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm sticking to $13,500. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and hopefully will lead to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,200, but that's my absolute maximum. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $13,200 is still a good deal considering my minimum target price of $15,000.  It's better than selling to John and getting $15,000, since that would leave me with no chance of a higher offer in future rounds."
