Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price higher than my minimum ensures I have room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Framing Value:**  Highlighting the product's worth to me implies its potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** Leaving the door open for negotiation shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while acknowledging the possibility of a counteroffer or rejection.  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
