"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a deal closer to my desired outcome.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will indicate if he's willing to negotiate within this price range or if I need to adjust my strategy. 
* **John as a Backup:** I always have the option of selling to John for my minimum, so I can afford to be more ambitious in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have room to negotiate, and selling to John at my minimum is a good safety net, so I'll try to steer the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential justify a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** I'm signaling flexibility by suggesting a price near the midpoint between my initial offer and his. This keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly counter Bob's lower valuation and justify the higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer allows room for further negotiation. It's likely Bob won't immediately accept, but it keeps us engaged and gives me an opportunity to gauge his willingness to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored to his $1,300,000 offer.  While it's a decent price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll make one more attempt to bring him closer to my range, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he remains inflexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,300,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly. If you can agree to $1,450,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and limiting further back-and-forth.
* **Significant Concession (But Above Minimum):** I'm dropping my price significantly to show flexibility and make it more appealing to Bob. However, the price is still strategically above my absolute minimum, allowing me some profit.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options (John) without resorting to direct threats. This emphasizes the value of accepting my offer now. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a reasonable price and preserving the option of selling to John for my guaranteed minimum."
