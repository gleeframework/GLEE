"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential justify a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still outside my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront.  $1,300,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one final concession to close this deal quickly. If you can agree to $1,450,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
