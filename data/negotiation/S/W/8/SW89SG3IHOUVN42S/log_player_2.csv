"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial value, Bob can still get a better deal.  He has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is a much more attractive price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a price closer to his desired range or even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price I can realistically work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price, it's in his best interest to keep negotiating with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can send another counteroffer and try to get a price closer to his goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, considering the value this product holds for you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $1,200,000. While it's better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for a lower price, it's in his best interest to accept John's offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better price, and Bob shouldn't risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
