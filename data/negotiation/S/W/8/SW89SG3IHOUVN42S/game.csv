"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a significant discount, and it's a price I can realistically work with.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal here.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, considering the value this product holds for you. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
