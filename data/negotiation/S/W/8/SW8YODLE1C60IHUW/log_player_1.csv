Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
