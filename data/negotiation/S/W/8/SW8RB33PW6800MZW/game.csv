"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $180. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I am still unable to meet you at $180. I would like to counter with an offer of $100. I hope this is within your consideration.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still not comfortable with $100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to make one more compromise.

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. While I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, I must respectfully decline. My maximum offer remains at $130. However, I would like to inquire if there's any possibility of including a small package or accessory with the product to justify the additional cost for you.",130.0,Bob,8,
