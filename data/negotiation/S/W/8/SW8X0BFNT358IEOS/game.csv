"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering your needs. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the significant discount I'm offering you.  I hope we can reach a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it. Let me know your decision.",925000.0,Alice,5,
