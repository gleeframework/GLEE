"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering your needs. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from the product's true value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will come down further, as she's already shown a willingness to compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This is a final offer from my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's now in Bob's best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $800,000.  While Bob might be able to get a slightly better price from Alice by continuing negotiations, there's no guarantee, and it's not worth the risk of potentially exceeding his budget."
