Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept if he's particularly eager.
* **Justification:** The ""special price"" framing and mentioning it's a ""great deal"" are subtle ways to nudge Bob towards accepting without revealing my true bottom line.
* **Alternative:**  I know I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer.  I may need to adjust my price based on his response."
