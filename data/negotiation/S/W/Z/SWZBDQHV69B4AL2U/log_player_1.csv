"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for a product that's worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to myself, hoping to create a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **""One-Time Offer"":**  This creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob more likely to consider my initial offer. 

**Important Note:** I am aware that this is likely a risky strategy. Bob might immediately reject the offer. However, by starting high, I'm positioning myself for a good outcome if we do enter a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell. This can encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I expected, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the value we both recognize. I'd like to counter with $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway. 
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and highlighting the benefits of this deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, which helps to keep the negotiations moving forward. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. By starting with a slightly lower price, I can increase my chances of Bob accepting, while still ensuring I get a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer again shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Potential for higher price:**  By continuing the negotiation, I'm giving Bob the opportunity to come closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:** 

I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still below the value I've put on this product.  To continue our negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Signal:**  I'm again offering a compromise, but this time, I'm only moving $50,000 lower than my previous offer. This signals that I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate Commitment:**  I emphasize my commitment to finding a solution, showing Bob that I'm still serious about selling to him, but not at any price.
* **Positive but Firm:** The tone is still positive, but the language is firmer, indicating that I'm getting closer to my limit.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. If he rejects it, I'm likely to accept John's offer, as continuing to negotiate with Bob may result in a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,425,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiations Stalled:** Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We have only four rounds left. It's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer in that time.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing me a sale that meets my needs.

**Strategy:**

With limited time remaining and Bob's offers still below my minimum, it's best to accept John's offer to ensure I get a good price and don't risk losing out completely. While I might be able to get a slightly better deal with Bob, the risk is too high given the limited time."
