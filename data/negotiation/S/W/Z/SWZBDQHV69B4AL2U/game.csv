"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for a product that's worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I expected, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the value we both recognize. I'd like to counter with $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Can you consider that?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still below the value I've put on this product.  To continue our negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
