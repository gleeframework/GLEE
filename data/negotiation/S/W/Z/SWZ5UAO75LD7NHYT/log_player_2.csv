"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's minimum value as possible.  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for Alice to profit. It also provides a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer increased from the previous round, which indicates she's not willing to budge much. However, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting another counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum acceptable price.  Bob is attempting to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that's a compromise between his previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $400 above Bob's last counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price.  There's not much more room for negotiation, and continuing could risk the deal falling apart.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher price from John or losing the deal entirely."
