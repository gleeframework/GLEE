{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value to give myself some room for negotiation. I also want to be polite and emphasize the value of the product for him.  We'll see if he's willing to go up a bit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell it for less than my minimum price of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'll make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is refusing to budge on his price and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd rather sell to Bob, I'm not comfortable going lower than my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John for a sure $150 than risk a deal falling apart with Bob."
