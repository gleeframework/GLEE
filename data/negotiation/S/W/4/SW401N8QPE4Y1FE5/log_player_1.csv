Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to start the negotiation higher with Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher by mentioning a public listing, potentially justifying the price to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially even better deal for you. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a reasonable opportunity."
