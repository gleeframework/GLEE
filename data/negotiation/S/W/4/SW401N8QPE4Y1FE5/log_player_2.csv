"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and what John is willing to sell it for ($8,000). 
* By rejecting this offer, you can move to a more favorable negotiation with Alice or purchase directly from John at a much lower price."
