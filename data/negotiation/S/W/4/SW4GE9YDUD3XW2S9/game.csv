"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still aiming a bit higher. Would you consider $1,650,000? This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and recognizes the value you see in the product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned and the market demand.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,580,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
