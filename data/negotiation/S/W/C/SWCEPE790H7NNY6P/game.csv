"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?  That feels like a fair price to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little too high for me. Would you be willing to do $7,500? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can agree on that.",8500.0,Alice,5,
