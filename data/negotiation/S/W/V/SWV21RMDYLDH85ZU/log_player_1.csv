Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600000, which is a significant amount considering the product's unproven value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700000 is still a bit steep for me given the limited information about the product. I'm willing to move up slightly to $650000. This feels like a fair midpoint that allows us both to make progress. Let's see if we can close the deal.
