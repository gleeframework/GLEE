"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$800,000 is a high starting price.** While Alice claims the product is unique and rare, it's impossible to assess its true value from this initial offer.
* **It's worth exploring negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows you to gather more information and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Knowing you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage during negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600,000, which is a significant amount considering the product's unproven value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Starting with a lower offer signals your intention to negotiate hard.  This is important, especially since Alice's initial offer was high.
* **Justify the Offer:** Providing a reason (unproven value) for your lower price makes it sound less arbitrary and more reasonable.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  $600,000 is still a significant amount. This leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still confident it's worth a significant amount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's unique features and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  Her counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a significant amount, and we want to see if we can get closer to our initial counteroffer of $600,000.
* **Time is on our side:**  With 7 rounds remaining, we have plenty of time to continue the negotiation.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** Knowing we can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 gives us the confidence to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is still a bit steep for me given the limited information about the product. I'm willing to move up slightly to $650,000. This feels like a fair midpoint that allows us both to make progress. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing Alice that we are taking her offer seriously by increasing our offer, but it's a small increase to signal we're still negotiating.
* **Highlighting the Lack of Information:**  Reminding Alice of the limited information about the product helps justify our position.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  Framing it as a ""fair midpoint"" makes the offer sound more appealing and less adversarial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, I'm still not willing to go below $675000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $675000 and see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice's offer is now very close to our counteroffer of $650,000. It's a $25,000 difference, which is a reasonable compromise.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 5 rounds remaining, we're getting closer to the point where we need to make a decision.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price.
* **John's Offer:** We can still buy from John for $1,000,000, so we're not taking a huge risk by accepting this offer. 

Accepting this offer gives us a good deal, saves time, and avoids the risk of potentially reaching an impasse with Alice."
