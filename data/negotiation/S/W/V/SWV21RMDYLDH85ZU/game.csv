Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600000, which is a significant amount considering the product's unproven value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still confident it's worth a significant amount. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's unique features and my initial asking price.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700000 is still a bit steep for me given the limited information about the product. I'm willing to move up slightly to $650000. This feels like a fair midpoint that allows us both to make progress. Let's see if we can close the deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, I'm still not willing to go below $675000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $675000 and see if we can finalize the deal.",675000.0,Alice,5,
