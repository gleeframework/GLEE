"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,300? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a decent profit. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9300.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,300. How about $9,150? It's my final offer",9150.0,Bob,6,
