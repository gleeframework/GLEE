"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This takes into account its true market value and the benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground: I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
