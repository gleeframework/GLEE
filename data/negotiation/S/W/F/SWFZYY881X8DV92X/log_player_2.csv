"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's original value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're interested in working with me."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering its value and my own costs. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice has come down to $9,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer again is the best strategy to try and get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable paying $9,000.  How about we split the difference and agree on $8,750?  That's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and my own costs.  Let's agree on this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $8,000. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and save $900.  Even though the negotiation with Alice is almost complete,  buying from John maximizes Bob's savings."
