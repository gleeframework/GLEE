"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is likely more than Bob is willing to pay, but it gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my desired price. This is a good compromise and I'm comfortable accepting it. The risk of continuing negotiation is that I might end up with a lower price, or even lose the deal completely if Bob changes his mind or gets a better offer elsewhere."
