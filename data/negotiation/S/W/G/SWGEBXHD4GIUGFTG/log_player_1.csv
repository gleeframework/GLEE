Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for you.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob before you have to sell to John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Consider these factors:

* **Greed vs. Certainty:** Bob might be willing to pay a premium over your minimum, but he also wants a good deal. 
* **Relationship:** If a future relationship with Bob is valuable, you might leave a little more profit on the table to foster goodwill. 

**The Offer**

Here's a strong opening offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and positions the product favorably.
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 secures you a significant profit ($350,000 above your minimum) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150,000 less than his valuation).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies you're open to discussing the price further, should Bob counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening salvo. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go while still ensuring a good deal for yourself."
