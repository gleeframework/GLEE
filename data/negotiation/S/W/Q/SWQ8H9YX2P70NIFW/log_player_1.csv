Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is still too low, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, $1,300,000 is still far too low.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find some middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000 as a final compromise.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I only have 4 rounds left. I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
