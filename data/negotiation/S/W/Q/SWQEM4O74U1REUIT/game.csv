"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider a price closer to $10,000?  I'm willing to negotiate to find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I can see the value in your product, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $7,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
