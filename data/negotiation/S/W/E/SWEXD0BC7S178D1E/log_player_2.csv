"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  There's still room to lower the price, and Bob has 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step down from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's still above John's offer, but it leaves room for further bargaining. The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties, but still advantageous for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob has 7 rounds left and should continue to try and negotiate a better price. There's a good chance that Alice, faced with the possibility of losing the sale to John, will be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making another significant move by lowering his offer to $1,025,000. This shows his determination to get the best possible price while also staying within his budget. This offer is only $25,000 higher than John's offer, putting more pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale. This offer leaves room for a small compromise on Alice's part, hopefully leading to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob has 5 rounds left and should continue to try and negotiate a better price. There's a good chance that Alice, faced with the possibility of losing the sale to John, will be willing to come down further.  Bob is likely to be able to get a better deal if he continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to John's offer. This counteroffer is only $10,000 higher than John's offer, putting significant pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale.  This offer is a strong attempt to secure a deal at a price that is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement on previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than John's.  With only 3 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's time to cut his losses and buy from John."
