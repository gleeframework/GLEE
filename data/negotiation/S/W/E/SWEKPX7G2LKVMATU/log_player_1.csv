Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $150,000 if Bob accepts the $1,150,000 offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is still significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob while ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value."
