"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price ($200) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Engaging Message:** I'm using a friendly and engaging message to build rapport and hopefully encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential range. 
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I'm keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $150, so I'll be ready to adjust my strategy as the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product within my budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Matches Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $150 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as I can sell to John for that price. 
* **Limited Upside:** There's not much room for negotiation, and further rounds could lead to a lower price or a wasted opportunity.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting now guarantees a sale and avoids risking further rounds where I could lose the opportunity to sell to Bob or John."
