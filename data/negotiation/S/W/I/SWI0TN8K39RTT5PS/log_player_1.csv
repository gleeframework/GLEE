Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $8,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about we try $8,750? That's the best I can do, but I really want to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a little more. I'll counter with a price slightly above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only comfortable dropping my price to $8,900. That's just a small step up from your offer, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
