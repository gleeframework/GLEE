"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000.  Let's try $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to still make a good profit.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $10,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,250. This would give us both a good deal. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,875.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $11,062.50?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?",11062.5,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there! Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $10,968.75. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I'm confident we can make this deal work.",10968.75,Bob,8,
