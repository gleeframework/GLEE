Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you at the price of $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering the product at $1,400,000:
    * I leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
    * I secure a profit of $400,000 if Bob accepts, which is significantly more than his initial valuation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a favorable price and ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed offer from John."
