Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth to you.  Let's be realistic -  how about $1,025,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm willing to consider this our final offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great opportunity.
