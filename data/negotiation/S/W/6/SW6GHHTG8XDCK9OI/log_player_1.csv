Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, but I want to see if I can get a higher price from him before selling to John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if he doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth to you.  Let's be realistic -  how about $1,025,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm willing to consider this our final offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about exploring other options. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm concerned that he may be genuinely considering other options.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, and I believe it's the best option at this point."
