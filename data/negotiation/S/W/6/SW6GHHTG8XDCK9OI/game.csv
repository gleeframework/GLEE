"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. That's the best I can do.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth to you.  Let's be realistic -  how about $1,025,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm willing to consider this our final offer, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great opportunity.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I'm starting to think about exploring other options. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
