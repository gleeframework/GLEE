Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000. While she might come down slightly in future rounds, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which meets your maximum budget."
