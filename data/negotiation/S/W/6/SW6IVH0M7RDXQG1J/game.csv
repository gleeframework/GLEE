"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
