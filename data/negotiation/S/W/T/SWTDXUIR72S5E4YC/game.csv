"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
