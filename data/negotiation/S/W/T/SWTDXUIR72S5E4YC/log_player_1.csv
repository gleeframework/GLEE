Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this offer represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 2000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable paying. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is offering the same amount as John, the product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to me.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob introduces risk with no potential upside.  It's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
