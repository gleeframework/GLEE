"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price.  By rejecting the offer, he can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear that you think we can find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $11,500 is less than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from $12,000 to $11,500. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or even end the negotiations altogether.  Accepting the offer at $11,500 saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John."
