"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $10,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear that you think we can find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
