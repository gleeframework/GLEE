"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000. 

Here's why:

* **Maximize Potential:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  
* **Negotiation Room:**  A high starting point gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary.
* **John as Backup:** I have John as a safety net, so I'm not afraid to risk losing the deal with Bob if the price isn't right. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. It's not even close to what I'm willing to accept. 

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll also be mindful of the fact that John is waiting in the wings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step in the right direction.

Here's my reasoning:

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I want to see if we can find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.
* **John's Price:**  While I'm willing to go lower than my initial price, I'm not going to go below John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By lowering my price, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of the product.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to settle just yet. 

Here's why:

* **John's Offer:** John is offering me $1,200,000, which is a safe and guaranteed option. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's still some room for negotiation with Bob, so I'm not going to accept an offer that's below my minimum value. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum or better."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is a significant step closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to find common ground.
* **Balancing Risk:** I'm balancing the risk of further negotiation with Bob against the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** I'm seeing if Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to get closer to my price.

Let's see if this offer finally gets Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we're getting closer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially with John offering a guaranteed $1,200,000. 

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum value.
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation is taking time, and I'm running out of rounds. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  I'm not comfortable with the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me or rejecting further offers.

It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk losing more money or running out of time."
