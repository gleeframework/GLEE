"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to come up slightly, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,
