"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $10,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's goal, he's still aiming to save even more.  He should reject and counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to come up slightly, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where he needs to decide:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** $10,500 is a great price, significantly lower than John's offer and closer to Bob's goal of $10,000. 
* **Reject and counteroffer:**  There's a risk Alice will stick to her final offer, and Bob might lose out on the deal. 
* **Buy from John:**  This is a less favorable option as it's the highest price.

Given the circumstances, it's best for Bob to accept Alice's offer.  He's saved a significant amount of money compared to John's price, and it's unlikely he'll get a better deal in future rounds."
