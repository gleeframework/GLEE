"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50. What do you think?",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $132.50 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $125. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",125.0,Alice,5,
