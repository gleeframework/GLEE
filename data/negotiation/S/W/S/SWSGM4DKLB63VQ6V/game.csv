"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering the value it holds for me.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than what you're willing to pay. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.
