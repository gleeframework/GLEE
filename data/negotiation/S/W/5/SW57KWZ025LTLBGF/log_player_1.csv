"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.  The risk is that Bob might walk away, but selling to John for $1,200,000 is still a decent outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I have another buyer (John) willing to pay the same amount. Given that I'm now in round 4, I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. It's more efficient and less risky to accept John's offer and close the deal."
