"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget ($22,000 vs. your $8,000 limit).  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $22,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product but I can't go above $8,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $22,000 is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high ($15,000) compared to your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price you can afford, and further negotiation is unlikely to succeed. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for your desired price."
