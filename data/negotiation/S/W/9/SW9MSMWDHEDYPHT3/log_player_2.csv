"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John, but still not ideal.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to $10,000. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $10,000.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a good deal within his budget."
