"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could come down to $1,275,000, which I feel is a fair reflection of its worth. This offer stands as a compromise, and I hope we can find an agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
