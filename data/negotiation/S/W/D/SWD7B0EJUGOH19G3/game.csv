"I like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think this product is truly worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $10,000. How about we meet at $9,750? That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. That's only $500 away from your last offer and a good compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time at $10,000.  That's a fair price, and it's the last offer I'm making. If you're not willing to go up to $10,000, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,7,,
