Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,200,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has reached her bottom line of $1,200,000 (this is the value it holds for her, so she's unlikely to go lower). 
* Continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice and risk the deal.
* While John offers the product for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves $300,000. 

At this point, it's a good strategic decision to accept the offer and secure a significant saving."
