"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit margin and reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would that be workable for you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,200,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.  Let's make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
