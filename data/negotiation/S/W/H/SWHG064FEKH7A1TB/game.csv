"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This price would still allow you to make a good profit, and it's closer to my asking price.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still too far from what I need to get for this product. Let's meet at $9,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to come out ahead.",9000.0,Alice,5,
