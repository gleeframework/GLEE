Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe this product would be highly valuable to you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Alice has a guaranteed $8,000 from John, so there's less pressure to drastically undersell.

By aiming high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of a profitable sale to Bob."
