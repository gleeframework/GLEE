{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and you know it's worth at least $80 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It reflects my minimum acceptable price and also sets the stage for negotiation. I'm open to negotiating with Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $150 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $150.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $140? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your original offer, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating. I'm better off selling the product to John for $150. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price and guarantees a better outcome for me."
