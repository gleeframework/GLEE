"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to do $90 for the product? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's my absolute top limit.",100.0,Bob,4,
