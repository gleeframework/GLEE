"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for a steal! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I can do $110, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on this deal. I can do $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. I can do $102.50, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $99 for the product. Can you reconsider and meet me at this price?",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $102.50, Bob. I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a minimum of $102.50 on this deal. I can do $101.25, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer.",101.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you've already compromised a lot, but I'm still not comfortable with $101.25. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",98.0,Bob,10,
