Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm asking for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with an offer of $20,000, Alice anchors the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even her own minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""limited-time offer"" is designed to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, potentially leading him to accept the offer without much deliberation.
* **Justification for the Price:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Alice, the message hints at high demand (""anticipating demand"") to justify the price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk Appetite:** This strategy is assertive and carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. However, Alice has a safety net with John's guaranteed purchase at $15,000.
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  Alice doesn't know Bob's personality. If he's a tough negotiator, this high starting point might discourage him. 
* **Relationship Building:** This approach prioritizes maximizing profit in the short term.  If Alice wants to build a long-term relationship with Bob, a softer approach might be more appropriate."
