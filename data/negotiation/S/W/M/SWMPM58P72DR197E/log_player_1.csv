Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, without going below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,500.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to my minimum value.  It's likely that we'll continue to go back and forth, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on."
