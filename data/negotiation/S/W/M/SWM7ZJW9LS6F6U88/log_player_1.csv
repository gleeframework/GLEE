"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially maximize my profits. 

I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. However, if he rejects this offer, I'll be ready to adjust based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it immediately. I have 9 rounds left, and I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price, but still above my minimum.  I'll also consider the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,800,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this compromise will make him more likely to accept, but I'll be ready to adjust further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and with only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000."
