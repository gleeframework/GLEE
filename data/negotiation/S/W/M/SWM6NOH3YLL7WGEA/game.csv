"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground. I'm definitely open to working something out, but  $1,200,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring significant value to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,150,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
