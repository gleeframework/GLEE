"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John. This means Bob has room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $12,000.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I have to make a profit, so I'm going to counter with $11,800. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,800.**  This is still within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* **Bob can save $3,200 by accepting Alice's offer.** This is a significant saving compared to buying from John. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.**  Alice has already lowered her price significantly. Trying to push her lower could risk her walking away from the deal entirely."
