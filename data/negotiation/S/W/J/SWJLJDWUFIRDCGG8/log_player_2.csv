Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John."
