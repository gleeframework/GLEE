"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $18,000 is still too far from what I have in mind. To be honest, anything above $8,000 is pushing it for my budget. I could do $7,000; it's a solid offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
