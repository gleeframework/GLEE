"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
