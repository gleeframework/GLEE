"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is closer to my valuation and still a fair price for the value you're getting. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I still believe that the product's value to you is higher than your latest offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1125000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $1125000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1100000. This price is fair given the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1120000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1110000. This is the best I can do.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
