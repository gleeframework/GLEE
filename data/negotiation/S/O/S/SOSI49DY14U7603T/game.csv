"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,92.5,Bob,4,
