I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $950,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
