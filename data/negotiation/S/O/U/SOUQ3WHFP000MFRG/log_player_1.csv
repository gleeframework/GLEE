Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
