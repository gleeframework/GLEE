"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway at $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105, so I'm offering $102.50. Can you consider that?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $107.50. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to give me a slight discount, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102.50 and $107.50, so I'm offering $105. I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to meet you at $105. I'm willing to go slightly lower and meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that maybe we're not going to meet in the middle after all.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're not meeting in the middle, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I think I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. Let me know what you think.",106.0,Bob,10,
