"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $800000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I must stick to my budgetary constraints. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,
