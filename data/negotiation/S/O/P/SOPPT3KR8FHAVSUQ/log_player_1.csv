Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There is a gap of $250,000 between my offer and Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to counter-offer while still being potentially beneficial to me. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $400,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's a good chance he'll be willing to pay more, especially considering the value the product holds for him.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have John's offer as a backup, so I don't need to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget concerns, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair price that allows you to stay within your budget while providing me with a reasonable return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counter-offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000).
* **Staying above my minimum:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Appealing to Bob's budget:**  The message emphasizes that my counter-offer allows Bob to stay within his budget while still getting a good deal.

**This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is beneficial to both parties while keeping my desired profit in mind.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, and I would like to suggest a price of $1,125,000. This still keeps the transaction within my budget, while also offering you a reasonable return for your product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiations are not progressing quickly enough:** We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offers are not moving close enough to my desired price point. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John is offering me a price that meets my minimum requirements and provides a comfortable profit margin. It's a sure thing.

**It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my asking price.**"
