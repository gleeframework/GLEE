"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, I'm creating a justification for the high initial price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at my desired price. This knowledge empowers me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing a substantial amount of potential profit, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to steer the negotiation closer to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  However,  the value this product brings is truly significant. I can come down to $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price reflecting its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial price, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition of the product to justify the still-high price.
* **Firmness:** By stating this is a ""fair and reasonable price,"" I'm subtly indicating that I'm less likely to make drastic concessions going forward.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps the price comfortably above my minimum acceptable price while leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on to other business opportunities."
