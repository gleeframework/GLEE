Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit. I'm confident in the value of the product and believe it's worth more than $800,000 to him, so I'm willing to be firm in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price and still leaves some room for negotiation."
