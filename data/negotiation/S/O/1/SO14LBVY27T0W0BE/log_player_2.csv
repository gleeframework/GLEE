Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my minimum. What do you think?
