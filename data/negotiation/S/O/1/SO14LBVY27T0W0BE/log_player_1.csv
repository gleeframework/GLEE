Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good deal for me and still represents a good value for Bob."
