Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a significant discount. How does $14,000 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's an opportunity to get even more from Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies I have other options and encourages Bob to decide quickly. 

This strategy aims to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay before he'd rather walk away."
