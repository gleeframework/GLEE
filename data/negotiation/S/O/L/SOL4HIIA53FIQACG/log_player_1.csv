Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no reason to go lower.  Offering it to Bob at your minimum acceptable price maximizes your potential profit.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering it to Bob first at a premium, you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** This firm offer doesn't leave much room for Bob to haggle, reinforcing the product's value.

**Important Note:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might still be willing to pay $10,000 if he perceives its value differently or has a strong need for it."
