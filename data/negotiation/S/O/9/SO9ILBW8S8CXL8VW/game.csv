"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is fair considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair middle ground.  Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,500. This is still a good deal, considering the value to you is $8,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which would be a fair compromise and allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's aim to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  $10,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This is a reasonable compromise that's very close to your last offer. Let's seal this deal.",9750.0,Bob,8,
