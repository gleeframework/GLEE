Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** Even though John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quicker at a higher price is more desirable."
