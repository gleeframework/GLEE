"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $162.50?",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $145? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we try $157.50?",157.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $157.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about we try $159? I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I really want this product.",159.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $159. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $160?",160.0,Alice,7,
