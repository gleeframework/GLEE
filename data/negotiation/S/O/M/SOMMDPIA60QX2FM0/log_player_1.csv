Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm willing to part with it for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, exceeding my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he counters. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $120, meeting my minimum."
