"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $120.  I'm serious about wanting this product, but I can't go higher than that.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're serious about the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $132.50?",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",120.0,Bob,6,
