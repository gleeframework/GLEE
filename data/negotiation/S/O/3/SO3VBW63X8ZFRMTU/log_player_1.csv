Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,850,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,425,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, but the gap is too wide to bridge in the remaining rounds.  It's more strategic to accept John's guaranteed offer and avoid further negotiation."
