Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer, and we are still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
