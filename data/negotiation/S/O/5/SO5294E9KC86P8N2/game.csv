"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point seems a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000 and call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
