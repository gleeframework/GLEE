"Hi Alice,  $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is limited to $800000. Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000 to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $900000 is still a little high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $850000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875000.  This is my final counteroffer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to other options.",875000.0,Alice,5,
