Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 gives Bob a potential discount while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Creating urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited time"" offer, you incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate further, getting you closer to your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation of the product."
