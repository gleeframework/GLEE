"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
