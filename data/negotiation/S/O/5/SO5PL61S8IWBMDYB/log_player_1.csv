Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique item. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this moment. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,100,000.  This would still allow you a healthy profit and give me a good deal.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
