"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that I'm confident you'll love.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this unique item. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this moment. I'd be happy to buy it for $1,100,000.  This would still allow you a healthy profit and give me a good deal.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal compared to what you could get elsewhere. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the value you'll get from it.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,200,000?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price, and it's a good outcome for both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
