Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly highlighting the product's value might make Bob more amenable to the higher price. 
* **Alternative:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80 gives you leverage.  If Bob rejects the initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell at your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your $80 minimum in mind."
