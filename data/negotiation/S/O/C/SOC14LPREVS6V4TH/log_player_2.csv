"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Although $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150, you know you can get the product for cheaper from John ($150). Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a subsequent turn."
