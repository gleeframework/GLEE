"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, we ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might be closer to our desired range. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** We always have John in our back pocket, willing to pay our minimum acceptable price. This knowledge gives us confidence to aim high in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is a significant sum and closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to get as close to $2,000,000 as possible. Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that we believe the product is worth more, prompting him to potentially increase his offer in the next round.  We're not in immediate danger of losing the deal since we have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, this product holds significant value and potential beyond the $1,600,000 mark.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels like a fair compromise to both parties. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down from our initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, the reduction is substantial enough to show we're serious about a higher price point.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We're still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation and comfortably above our safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is my initial offer. I'm not willing to go above that price. Can we meet at $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,700,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above Bob's initial valuation and comfortably exceeds our safety net with John. 
* **Stalemate Risk:**  Bob has indicated his unwillingness to go higher than $1,700,000. Continuing negotiations might lead to a stalemate and risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Prolonging negotiations for a potentially small gain might not be worth the time and effort."
