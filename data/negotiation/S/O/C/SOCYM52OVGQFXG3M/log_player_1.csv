Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit, but leaves room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's a clear message:** This clearly states your price and leaves room for Bob to respond. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, you can consider a lower counteroffer, but be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and lower than your initial offer. While it's tempting to accept his offer, rejecting it allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your desired price. 

You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer or use this opportunity to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlight the value:** It emphasizes the potential for Bob to profit from the product, making it more appealing.
* **Set a clear expectation:** It clarifies your current price point and encourages Bob to consider a compromise. 

By using a counteroffer, you maintain control of the negotiation and keep the possibility of a higher sale price.  Remember, you can always choose to accept Bob's offer or walk away and sell to John if you feel his offer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your desired price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer or use this opportunity to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer further.

Consider this:

* **Your minimum:** Remember, you're not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, who's willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Bob's potential:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, but his offer is still too low. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you're maintaining your negotiating power and potentially achieving a better outcome."
