Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.

This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's closer to your last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000.  While she *might* be willing to negotiate down a little more, the potential savings are not worth the risk of her walking away. Buying from John guarantees a price of $1,000,000, which is a sure thing and a reasonable saving compared to Alice's current offer."
