"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price? I'm thinking closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $900,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $850,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
