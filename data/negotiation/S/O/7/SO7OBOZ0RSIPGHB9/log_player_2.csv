Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,750, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and further negotiation might take too long.  John's offer is guaranteed, and it's within Bob's budget."
