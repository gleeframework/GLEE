"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,750, which is a fair compromise.  I believe this price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
