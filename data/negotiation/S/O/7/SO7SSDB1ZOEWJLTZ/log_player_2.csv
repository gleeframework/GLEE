"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (25% off) shows Alice you're serious about negotiating.  This gives us a good starting point to see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $140, which is a good compromise.  While I'd ideally like to pay less, I'm not sure how much further she'll go and it's worth avoiding the risk of her increasing the price or me ending up with nothing.  $140 is still a decent price compared to John's $150, so accepting is the best option at this stage."
