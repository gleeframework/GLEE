"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the unique product. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose an offer closer to my maximum limit of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1100000. I think this is a fair compromise, but I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1100000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, I still feel it's a bit high for me. Considering my budget constraints and the value I place on this purchase, I would like to propose an offer of $950000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you and move us closer to reaching an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering the value I place on it, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope it will be acceptable to you. If not, I'm willing to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1050000 is beyond my budget. After careful reflection, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose an offer of $1000000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you and brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
