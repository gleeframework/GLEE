"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider accepting $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to another buyer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
