Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are too far from my minimum price. It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John."
