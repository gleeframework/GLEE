"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. Considering your initial offer was $2,300,000 and your new offer is $2,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $2,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Bob,4,
