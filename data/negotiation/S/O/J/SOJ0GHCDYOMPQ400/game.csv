"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,750. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional support and training to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $8,750, I'll include an extra hour of consulting and a personalized setup session to ensure you get the most out of the product.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the additional support, but  I'm still firm on $8,500.  We've been going back and forth, and this is the best price I can offer.  If you're serious about making a deal, let's meet in the middle at $8,625.  It's a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,750. I'm willing to throw in an additional feature that I think will be valuable to you, which will increase the product's value even further. If you're willing to meet me at $8,750, I'll include this feature and the additional support and training I mentioned earlier. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you adding more to the deal, but my focus is on the price.  We've been at this for a while, and I'm still confident that $8,625 is the fairest price. This is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal now.",8625.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your focus on the price, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I've already given you a great deal, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $8,000, and I think it's a fair price. If you're willing to meet me at $8,750, I'll give you the deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",8750.0,Alice,9,
