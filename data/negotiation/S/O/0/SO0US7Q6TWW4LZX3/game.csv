"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it shows we're both willing to compromise. Let's close this deal!",97.5,Alice,5,
