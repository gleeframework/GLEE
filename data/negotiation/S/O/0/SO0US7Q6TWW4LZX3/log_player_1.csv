"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question to invite a response and show that I'm open to discussing the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While I don't want to risk losing the sale completely, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **Staying in Control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $100, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $100 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal of maximizing profit. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room to push for a higher price.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I want to see if I can get a better price, but I also need to consider the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it shows we're both willing to compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a smaller compromise this time, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise, which makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting they close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
