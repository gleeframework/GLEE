"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? That's a reasonable compromise.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about $8,000? It's the minimum I can accept to make this worthwhile. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
