Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, suggesting a win-win situation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price leaves some room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a higher price without risking Bob completely rejecting the offer.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $800,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price of $800,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He acknowledged the product's value, and I can likely get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **John as a backup:** I can always fall back on John if negotiations with Bob fail.  Having a backup buyer gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a tempting offer, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?  This price is still within your budget, and it allows me to stay closer to the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell at a significantly lower price.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, justifying a price above his initial offer.
* **Appeal to common ground:** The message is focused on finding common ground, increasing the chances of Bob accepting the counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me the option to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too far from my target. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but no more. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on value.
* **No further negotiation:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly higher price, and could risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and secure my minimum desired profit. 
* **No risk:**  Since John is willing to pay the same price, accepting Bob's offer avoids any risk of losing the deal and ending up with John as the buyer."
