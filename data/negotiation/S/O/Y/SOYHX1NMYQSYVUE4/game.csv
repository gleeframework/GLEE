"Alice, thanks for the offer. $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,025,000.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is the highest I can go, let's see if we can make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
