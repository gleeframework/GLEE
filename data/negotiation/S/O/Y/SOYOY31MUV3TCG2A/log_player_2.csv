Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably and is now offering the product for $790,000.  This is a significant savings from both her original offer and John's offer of $1,200,000.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting riskier.  Alice seems firm, and we don't want to miss out on this deal by pushing too hard."
