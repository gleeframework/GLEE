Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $80. If Bob rejects, I'll see how he values the product based on his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, showing some flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $80 that it's worth accepting. Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away entirely outweighs the potential gain."
