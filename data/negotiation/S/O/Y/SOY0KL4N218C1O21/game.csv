"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show my commitment to making this deal work.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
