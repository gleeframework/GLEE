"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price.  This is a bold move, but since I have the option of buying from John for $8,000, I'm willing to risk Alice rejecting the offer.  If she does, I'll simply buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, which is closer to my maximum budget. However, it's still not within my desired range. I've already made my best offer, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees I get the product at my desired price."
