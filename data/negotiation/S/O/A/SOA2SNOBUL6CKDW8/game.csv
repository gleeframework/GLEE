"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This price acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
