Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000, which is still a discount from my original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly not going to budge much below $1,050,000. We have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's better to take the sure thing and save $75,000."
