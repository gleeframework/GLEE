"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than $100. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price? My initial offer is $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I'm willing to consider a compromise. My counteroffer is $110. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope this proposal works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay right now.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $107.50. This allows for a fair deal for both of us and keeps us within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. My counteroffer is $109. This price reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I value the product, $109 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to offer $108, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. This would allow us to both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. Let's finalize this!",108.0,Bob,6,
