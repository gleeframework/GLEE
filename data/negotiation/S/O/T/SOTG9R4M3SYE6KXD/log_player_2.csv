"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay, there's room for negotiation.  He should try to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This creates room for further negotiation while demonstrating Bob's seriousness in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he can still aim for a better deal.  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the possibility of a lower price alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still below Alice's last offer, demonstrating a continued effort to negotiate a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget and only $90,000 above Alice's minimum.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price is significant.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's acceptable to Bob while minimizing the potential for further delays and risks."
