Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its true market value. How about we start the conversation at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a bit steep. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,100,000?  This seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm still open to negotiating with Bob, as there's a good chance we can settle on a price higher than John's offer.  We are getting closer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,100,000 is still cutting it too close. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,225,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We're so close to my minimum, but I believe I can get a slightly better deal still. It's worth risking another round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are close! I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,160,000, but that's as high as I can go.  This is a very fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product.

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's unlikely to move significantly higher, and I'm risking losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Selling to John makes the most sense at this point."
