"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your starting price is quite high.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price that reflects its true market value. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,350,000? I'm confident this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think it's a bit steep. To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $1,100,000?  This seems like a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,100,000 is still cutting it too close. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,225,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a bit more on this.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 to get this deal done. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the current market conditions.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal today. Let's settle at $1,185,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",1185000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are close! I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,160,000, but that's as high as I can go.  This is a very fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product.",1160000.0,Bob,8,
