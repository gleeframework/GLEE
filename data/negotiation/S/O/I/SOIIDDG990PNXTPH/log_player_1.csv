Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my valuation for the product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects a compromise from both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly more beneficial than John's offer. It makes more sense to cut negotiations short and secure the $1,000,000 from John."
