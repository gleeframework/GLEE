Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that has immense value. My initial price is $1,800,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential benefits this product offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his initial counteroffer is too low. I'll try to counter him to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,000,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This price still reflects the immense value of this product. I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a limited budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible outcome for this round."
