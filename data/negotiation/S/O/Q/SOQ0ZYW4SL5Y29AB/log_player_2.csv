"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you see the value in, for $9,500.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $10,000. You should reject the offer and buy the product from John, as you're willing to pay his price."
