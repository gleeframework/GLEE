,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for 125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still above what I can afford. I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute max is $110. Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 130. It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product, which is a fair compromise. I really want to buy it from you, so please consider my offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for 122.50. It's a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a fair compromise.",122.5,Alice,7,
