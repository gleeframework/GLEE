"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the ""opportunity"" and ""valuable asset"" to appeal to Bob's potential gain.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not aiming for a quick close here.  I want to see how Bob responds and gauge his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:** I'm always aware of my ""Plan B"" with John, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and leaves room for you to still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While I can walk away and sell to John, I want to explore if a better deal is possible with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain leverage and show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

**Next Round:** I'll counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable range, but still below John's offer to keep Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant move closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" to encourage Bob to see the value of a deal.
* **Remaining Firm:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but I've shown flexibility.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price, and the counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll wait for Bob's response to see if he's willing to compromise further.  I'm prepared to counter again if needed, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is closer to my budget. Let's aim for a quick resolution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Focus on Value:** I need to emphasize the product's value to Bob and remind him of the potential gains he'll miss if he doesn't close the deal. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  While I could sell to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal. 

**Next Round:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below John's offer, while emphasizing the benefits of a successful negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Compromise Emphasis:**  I reiterate my willingness to compromise to encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Positive Framing:**  I focus on the ""benefits"" of closing the deal to motivate Bob to accept.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  I add a touch of urgency by suggesting ""closing this deal"" to encourage Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm cautiously optimistic that Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price. However, I'm prepared to counter again if needed and, as always, I'm aware of the option to sell to John."
