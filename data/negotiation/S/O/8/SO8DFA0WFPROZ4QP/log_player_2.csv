"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and leaves room for you to still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is closer to my budget. Let's aim for a quick resolution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially continue negotiating with Alice, her offer of $925,000 is relatively close to your maximum budget.  It's more likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price adjustments. You'd be risking more rounds and potential deal collapse to save a small amount of money. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
