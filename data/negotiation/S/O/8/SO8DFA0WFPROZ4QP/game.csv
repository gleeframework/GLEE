"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it and leaves room for you to still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part and is closer to my budget. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Alice,5,
