"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $10,000. This is still a considerable discount from my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will make Bob more willing to negotiate and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my minimum value, it's a decent price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether, especially since John is willing to pay my full price."
