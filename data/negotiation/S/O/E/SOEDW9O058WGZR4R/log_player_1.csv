"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to leave room for negotiation but also attractive to Bob considering the product's value to him. It also shows confidence and sets the tone for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept that offer just yet. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I have several rounds left to negotiate. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $900,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. How about we meet at $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept that offer just yet. It's still a bit low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my goal of $900,000. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, but $825,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  Even if I were to accept his offer, I would only be making $800,000, which is the same as selling to John. Since I only have 4 rounds left, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John now, guaranteeing myself the $800,000.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale than risk further negotiation with Bob."
