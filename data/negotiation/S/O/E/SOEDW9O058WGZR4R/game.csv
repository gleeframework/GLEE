"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This would be a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $900,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. How about we meet at $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, but $825,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $800,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
