Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough to make it worth continuing to negotiate.  John is offering a much better price, so I'm going to sell to him."
