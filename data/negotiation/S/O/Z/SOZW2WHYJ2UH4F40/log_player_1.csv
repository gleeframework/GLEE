Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. It's in great condition and I think you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still exceeding our minimum selling price ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle on a price above $150.
* **Time Factor:** We have a guaranteed backup offer from John at $150.  This allows us to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject $145 outright. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward."
