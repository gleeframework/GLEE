Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, hoping to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm expecting Bob to counter, but my starting point sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.  If he doesn't meet my minimum requirements, I'll move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $12,000 mark. I'll try to leverage the fact that he's already shown interest by counteroffering and hopefully convince him to meet me halfway. If he doesn't budge, I can always sell to John, who is willing to pay my full asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($9,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""close this deal"" to imply that I'm serious about selling and encourage Bob to accept.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate his next counteroffer carefully.  If it's too low, I'll sell to John. However, if it's closer to my target, I might be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider your last offer. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that drastically undervalues the product. 

**Next steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll reiterate my reasons for needing a higher price and emphasize the value he'll get from the product.  If he still refuses, I'll move on to John and sell to him for the full $15,000."

Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer, adding pressure and urgency to the situation. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value for Bob, highlighting the benefit he'll get from purchasing it.
* **Emphasizing minimum:** I'm reminding Bob that $12,000 is my absolute minimum price, leaving no room for further negotiation down.
