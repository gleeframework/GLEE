"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm firm on $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you and my minimum requirement. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this offer is the best we can achieve.
