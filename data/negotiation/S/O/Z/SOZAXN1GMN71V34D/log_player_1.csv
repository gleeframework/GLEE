Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a better deal. I have 8 more rounds to get a higher price, so it's worth the risk."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I only have two rounds left, and Bob is not showing any willingness to move closer to my desired price. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk ending up with a lower price from Bob."
