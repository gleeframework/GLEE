"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,275,000. This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
