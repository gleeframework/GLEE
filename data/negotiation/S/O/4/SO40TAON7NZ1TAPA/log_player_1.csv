Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for $90.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $80. Since this is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
