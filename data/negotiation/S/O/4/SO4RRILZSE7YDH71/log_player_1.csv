Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. It's a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $90, Alice. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:

Bob is not moving significantly towards my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll reach $85, and I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer than risking further negotiation."
