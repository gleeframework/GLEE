"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Offering it at $1,100,000 is close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring a profitable outcome if accepted. 

By starting high, we leave space to negotiate down while still aiming for a price that maximizes profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than his perceived value of $1,200,000 and our initial asking price.  There's a substantial margin for negotiation here. We'll aim to guide him closer to the $1 million mark in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a counteroffer that shows flexibility ($50,000 reduction) but remains firm on our target of above $1 million.
* **Justifying the Price:**  We're reiterating the product's value to reinforce the idea that our price is fair and not arbitrary. 
* **Finding a Compromise:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to meet us somewhere in the middle, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets our target price and represents a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price and John's offer. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant return and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
