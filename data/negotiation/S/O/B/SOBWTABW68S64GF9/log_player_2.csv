Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  How about $87?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $88. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and $88 is a good price.  It's only $3 more than my ideal price of $85, and it's worth avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on the product or having to buy it from John for $100."
