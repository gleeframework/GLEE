"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a final offer, as I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
