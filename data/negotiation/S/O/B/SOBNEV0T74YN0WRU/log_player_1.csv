Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I know this is a premium over its base value, but I believe the unique benefits it provides will be highly valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than $12,000 sets a strong anchor point for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, it increases the chances of selling for more than your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique benefits"" provides a reason for the higher price, making it more palatable for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer doesn't start at Bob's maximum perceived value, allowing space for potential negotiation and compromise.
* **Safety Net:** Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
