"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I know this is a premium over its base value, but I believe the unique benefits it provides will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $15,000, which is $3,000 more than its value to me. I'd rather buy it from John for the fair price of $12,000.
