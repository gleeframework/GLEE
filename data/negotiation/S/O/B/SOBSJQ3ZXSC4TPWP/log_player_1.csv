Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,300,000. I'm confident this represents a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product much higher than John. Aiming for a price closer to his valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price while maintaining a professional and non-aggressive tone. 

This strategy balances ambition with the need to secure a deal, as Bob has the option to walk away."
