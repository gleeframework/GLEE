Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know you recognize its value, as it's worth a minimum of $1,500,000 to both of us.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000.  This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both parties, starting with a price significantly above that leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the minimum worth to both parties, Alice subtly anchors Bob's thinking around that number while justifying the higher asking price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""swift and mutually beneficial transaction"" and ""unique chance"" aim to add a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially encouraging Bob to accept without much back-and-forth.

**Important Note:** Alice has a strong fallback position with John willing to pay $1,500,000. This allows her to be bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
