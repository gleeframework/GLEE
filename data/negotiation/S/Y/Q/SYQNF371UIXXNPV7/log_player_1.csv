"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just isn't going to work for me.  How about $135? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy this product. "", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $130.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also considering selling to John for $150. I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your interest.  But $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.  Let's get this deal done! "", ""product_price"": 132}
