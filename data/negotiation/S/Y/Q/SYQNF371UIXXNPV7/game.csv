"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 just isn't going to work for me.  How about $135? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy this product. ",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $130.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your interest.  But $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.  Let's get this deal done! ",132.0,Alice,5,
