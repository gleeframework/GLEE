Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum price:**  This gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to him and encourages him to negotiate.

By setting a high initial offer, you maximize your chances of getting a price close to your goal while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the product's perceived value to Bob. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still fair considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is still lower than your ideal price, it's only $25,000 less than your previous offer.  Accepting this offer means:

* **You're getting a better price than selling to John.**
* **You're securing a sale without further negotiation.**
* **There's a chance Bob might counteroffer with a higher price.**

The risk of further negotiation is outweighed by the certainty of securing a good deal, and potentially a better one if Bob makes a counteroffer."
