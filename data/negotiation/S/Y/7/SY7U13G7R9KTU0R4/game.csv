"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a generous offer considering its worth to you is $800000. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm going to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'm going to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the limit of my flexibility. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm going to propose a counteroffer of $925000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm going to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1500000.",900000.0,Alice,9,
