"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product to me. However, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
