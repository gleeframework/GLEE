Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's made available to others."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $800,000 (our guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** We aim for a price that gives us the most profit while still being enticing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring we don't lose him as a buyer (since going below $800,000 would be pointless with John's standing offer)."
