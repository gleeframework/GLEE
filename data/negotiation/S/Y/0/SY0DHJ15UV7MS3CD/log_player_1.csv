"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong starting point that gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I believe it's important to aim high initially to see how much Bob is willing to pay and to establish a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I need to counteroffer and try to get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a significant amount for Bob but it is a more reasonable price considering my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear he's trying to undervalue the product, and I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I need to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. I believe the value of the product justifies this price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's time to see if Bob is serious about making a deal. If he rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob continues to undervalue the product. I've reached my minimum price, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
