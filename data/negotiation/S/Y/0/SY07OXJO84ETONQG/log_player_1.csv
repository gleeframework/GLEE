Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,000,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Your Potential Profit:** $200,000 (Bob's value - your reservation price)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value while ensuring you don't price it so high that he rejects it.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit ($150,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000).
* **No Room for Negotiation (Implied):** The directness of the price suggests it's a carefully considered offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If you have a long-standing relationship with Bob or anticipate future deals, you might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill.
* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start a bit higher to allow room for negotiation.
