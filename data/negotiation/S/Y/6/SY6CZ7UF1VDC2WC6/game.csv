"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the deal, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $125. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
