Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth a significant amount to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000.  Given its value, I'm confident this is a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You're aiming high because you know Bob has a strong incentive to buy. The product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and you have a guaranteed backup offer.
* **Justification:**  The message lightly hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your guaranteed $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. There's a chance Bob could be turned off by the high initial price and walk away. However, the potential payoff of exceeding your guaranteed offer makes it a calculated risk."
