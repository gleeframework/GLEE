Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a steal!,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $75. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love it!",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $75 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $70. Let's see if we can find common ground.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $72.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you!",72.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $72.50 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $70 for this. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is the highest price you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to make a slight adjustment to my original offer. I'll sell the product to you for $71. It's the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",71.0,Alice,7,
