Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the sale and being forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is profitable for me, and I believe it's a good outcome in this situation."
