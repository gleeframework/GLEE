"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair price that reflects both of our positions.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
