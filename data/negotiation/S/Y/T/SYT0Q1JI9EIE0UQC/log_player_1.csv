Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I understand your perspective on the market value, the product holds significant intrinsic value to me, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I'm looking for.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's worth to you.

While $1,250,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,275,000. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'd like to propose one last counteroffer. I'm thinking $1,225,000. This is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his $1,225,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While we could try to push Bob a bit further, the difference is not worth the risk of losing a substantial amount of money."
