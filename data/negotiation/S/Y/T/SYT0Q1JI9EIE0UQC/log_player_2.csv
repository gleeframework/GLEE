Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, the product holds significant intrinsic value to me, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,300,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,250,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.
