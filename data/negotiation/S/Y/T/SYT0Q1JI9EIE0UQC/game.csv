"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price considering the market value. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, the product holds significant intrinsic value to me, and $1,200,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,300,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to propose $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,250,000 isn't ideal, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,275,000. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'd like to propose one last counteroffer. I'm thinking $1,225,000. This is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
