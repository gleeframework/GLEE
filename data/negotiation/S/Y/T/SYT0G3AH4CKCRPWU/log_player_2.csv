"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to get the product for as low as possible, ideally under your $150 limit. Alice's initial offer of $140 is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still determined to get it lower. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit too far apart.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $132.50.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

By offering $132.50, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still pushing for a lower price. This is a more subtle adjustment than my previous offer, making it seem more reasonable to Alice. It also sets up a potential win-win scenario where we both meet in the middle."
