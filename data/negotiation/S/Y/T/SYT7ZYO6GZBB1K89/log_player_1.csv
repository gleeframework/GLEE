Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $10,000 mark. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, making it the more profitable and less risky option."
