"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While it sounds great, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $100. Would you be willing to sell for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. However, considering the quality and unique features of the product, I am unable to reduce the price below $100. Therefore, I am unable to accept your offer of $70. I would like to propose $90 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of our product.",90.0,Alice,3,
