"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, though. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to adjust to find common ground.  Could you consider $1,850,000?  This offer reflects my desire to reach a deal while acknowledging the inherent value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,850,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
