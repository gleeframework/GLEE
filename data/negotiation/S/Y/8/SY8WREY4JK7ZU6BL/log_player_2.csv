"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $800,000 to you. However, I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, considering our previous conversations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a generous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is grossly overestimating the product's worth to you. While her offer is lower than her perceived value, it's still significantly more than what you're willing to pay and what John offers.  You're better off going with John's offer."
