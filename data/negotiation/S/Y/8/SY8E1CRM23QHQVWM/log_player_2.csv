Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8950, but I need to make a profit. This is my last concession, so I hope you're ready to make a decision.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,950 is very close to my target price.  It's also a significant reduction from her initial price, so it seems like she's genuinely trying to make a deal.  It's worth taking this offer and saving the $50 compared to John's price.  I'm also getting the product for less than my initial budget."
