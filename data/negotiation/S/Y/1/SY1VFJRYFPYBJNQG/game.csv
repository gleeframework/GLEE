"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,075,000? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
