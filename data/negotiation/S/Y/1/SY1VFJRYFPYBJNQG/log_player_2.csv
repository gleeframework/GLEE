{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within my budget and still gives you a decent profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate. I'm going to try for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,075,000? This would be a good middle ground and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is very close to my target price of $1,050,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  This is a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
