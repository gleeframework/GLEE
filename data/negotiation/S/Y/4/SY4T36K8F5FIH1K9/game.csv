"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price of $1,450,000.  What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I acknowledge the product's value,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which still leaves room for profit for you. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product for you is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,375,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's make this our final exchange - $1,360,000, and we have a deal.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being firm on the value of the product.  However, $1,360,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,340,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1340000.0,Bob,6,
