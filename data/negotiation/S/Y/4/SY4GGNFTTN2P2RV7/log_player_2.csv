"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business. My asking price is $1,400,000, which allows for a significant profit margin for you. I'm confident this is a fair price, given the product's potential value to you.  Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer. However, it's important to note that her fallback offer is $1,200,000, which is the product's worth to her. This suggests she's motivated to sell even at a lower price. 
* **Your Maximum:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but it's always advantageous to get the lowest price possible. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potential negotiation. There's a good chance she might be willing to lower her price closer to your acceptable range rather than lose the sale entirely. 
 
**Important Note:** While you could buy from John directly, it's always beneficial to explore if you can get a better deal with Alice first."
