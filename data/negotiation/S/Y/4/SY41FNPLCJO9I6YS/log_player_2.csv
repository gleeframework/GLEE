"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm comfortable offering $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,600? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** It's a middle ground between Bob's previous counteroffer of $13,000 and Alice's previous offer of $13,600. 
* **It's within Bob's budget.**  $13,600 is still less than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($15,000).
* **Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price.**  While Bob could try for a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge much further, and there's a risk of reaching an impasse and having to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting, Bob secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
