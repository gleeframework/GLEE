Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer. 

While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, aiming higher with Bob could result in a more profitable outcome."
