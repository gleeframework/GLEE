Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going straight for my minimum, leaving space for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining the John option:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $12,000 open, ensuring a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Maintaining John as a backup:**  Even though Bob's counteroffer is low, I'm not desperate. I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not sticking to my initial price. This counteroffer shows flexibility while still keeping my minimum in mind.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive for the price, reminding him that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  The $9,000 offer leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation, if necessary. 
* **Maintaining John as an option:** I'm still ready to sell to John for $12,000 if necessary, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is still a viable option:**  If Bob doesn't agree to a price closer to my minimum, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $8,500 is still just a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $9,250. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we want. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting the fairness:** I'm emphasizing that the offer is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaving room for a final decision:**  This counteroffer allows for one last round of negotiation, leaving room for Bob to accept or counter.
* **Maintaining John's offer:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John for $12,000, which gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference again - I'm willing to meet you at $8750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While $8,750 is the closest Bob has come to my minimum, it's still not enough for me to be satisfied.
* **Risk of further lowering the price:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could result in a final price that's significantly lower than my desired value.
* **John offers the best outcome:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price of $12,000, which guarantees I get the best possible outcome for the product. 

Selling to John now eliminates further risk of accepting a lower price from Bob, ensuring a good financial outcome."
