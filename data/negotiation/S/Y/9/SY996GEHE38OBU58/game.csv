"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product's worth, and I'd like to get a better deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet halfway at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the best price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price.  However, $1,250,000 is below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,325,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial price and reflects my strong desire to do business with you. Let me know your decision.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
