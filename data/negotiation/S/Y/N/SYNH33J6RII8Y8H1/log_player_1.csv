Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 aims to significantly increase your profit.
* **Gauging interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and provides room for negotiation if he counters.  
* **Alternative buyer:** Mentioning other potential buyers isn't necessary yet. It might create unnecessary pressure in the initial stage. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering Bob's valuation of the product."
