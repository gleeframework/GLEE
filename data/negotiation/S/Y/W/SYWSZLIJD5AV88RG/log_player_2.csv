"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **Your Maximum:** $15,000
* **John's Price:** $15,000

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. Accepting her offer saves you $1,000 compared to John's price."
