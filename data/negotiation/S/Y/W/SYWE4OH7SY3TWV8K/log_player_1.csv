Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying your product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal than $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** We show flexibility by coming down slightly, but not too much to compromise our position.
* **Justification:** Reiterating the value reminds Bob of why he's interested and makes the price more palatable."
