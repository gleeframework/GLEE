"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  Let's try $850000. It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
