{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's definitely above my minimum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still $3,000 in potential profit for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Is above your minimum:**  It ensures you make a profit, even if Bob doesn't budge on the price.
* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message conveys flexibility and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's something you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's value to Bob. It's worth pushing for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is still very fair considering the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is close to my initial counteroffer of $10,500. It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable with this price.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and it avoids further negotiation."
