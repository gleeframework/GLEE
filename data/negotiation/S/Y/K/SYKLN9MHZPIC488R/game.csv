"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it holds immense value for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  This product has a lot of potential value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. Let's try $1,150,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about we split the difference at $1,275,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to be close to your asking price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
