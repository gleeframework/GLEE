Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider. The product is worth significantly more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is a fair compromise given its value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
