"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Reasonable price:** While the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's still a reasonable starting point, especially considering the product's value to me. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aware I could lose the deal by starting too high, but I'm willing to take that risk to try and secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $95 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($100), it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Opportunity for counter-offer:**  I have 8 rounds left and can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having the option to sell to John for $100 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get a higher price in the next round while keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95).
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing my offer as a fair price for both of us, acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while maintaining my own minimum value. 
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message remains positive, encouraging Bob to see this as a mutually beneficial agreement.

This approach aims to create momentum towards a deal while still maintaining a position of strength.  I'm confident that $105 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe this counteroffer will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $100 matches my minimum acceptable price for the product.
* **No further negotiation needed:**  There's no incentive to continue negotiating as I've reached my desired outcome.
* **Time constraint:**  I've already used 4 rounds and it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing time and potentially getting a worse offer later. 

While I could technically counter-offer again and try to get a slightly higher price, the potential gains are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely or wasting time in further negotiations. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
