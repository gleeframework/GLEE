"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's still above Alice's value but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice some wiggle room to accept while still allowing Bob to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising her price again is high. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice.  It's still below Bob's maximum price of $10,000 and a better deal than buying from John."
