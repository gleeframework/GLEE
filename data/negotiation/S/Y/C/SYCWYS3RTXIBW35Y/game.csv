"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it gives you a good return on your investment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
