"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a mutually agreeable price through negotiation. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product,  $18,000 is significantly higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This would still allow you to make a good profit and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to bring the price down further. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to purchasing this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $12,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $16,000. It's a fair price that balances our interests, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $16,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could result in a deal falling through.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed option from John."
