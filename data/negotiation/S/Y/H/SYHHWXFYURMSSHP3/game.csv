,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,087,500. This price is a compromise that allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1087500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. It's getting very close to the point where I'll have to consider other options.  I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500 as my final offer. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further delays.",1112500.0,Alice,7,
