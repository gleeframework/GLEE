"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is lower than her product's value to her ($100), you know you can get a better deal from John at $80.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
