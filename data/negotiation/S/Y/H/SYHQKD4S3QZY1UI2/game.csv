"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  Based on its market value and potential benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This price reflects a significant opportunity for you, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000, which still reflects the value and potential of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
