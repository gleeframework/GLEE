"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm initially pricing it at $16,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than your $8,000 limit and even more than her own valuation.  You should definitely counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a price closer to $6,000 to make this work."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It leaves you room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will give you insight into how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she's completely unwilling to budge from her initial price, you can quickly move on to John. 
* **Psychological Anchor:** By presenting $6,000 first, you're setting a psychological anchor. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it frames the negotiation around a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $16,000 represents its true value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down significantly, which is a good sign. However, $11,000 is still above both your budget and her own perceived value of the product ($12,000). There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle somewhere around $7,500? That would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:**  We're moving up from $6,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not in huge leaps. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $7,500 keeps the price below your $8,000 limit while aiming slightly above the midpoint between your previous offer ($6,000) and her current one ($11,000).
* **Maintaining a ""Fair Deal"" Tone:** By emphasizing fairness, you're reinforcing the idea that you're looking for a mutually beneficial agreement, not just trying to lowball her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations.  I could come down to $9,500, but that's my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but her ""best offer"" of $9,500 is still above your $8,000 limit.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll move much more. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which meets your needs and saves you money. It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice."
