"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
