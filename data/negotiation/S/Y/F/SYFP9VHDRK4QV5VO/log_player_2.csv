"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'd pay $900,000, saving $600,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:** You'd pay $1,500,000, which is the maximum you're willing to spend, but offers no savings. 

It's always better to save money, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
