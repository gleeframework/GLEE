"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $115 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $112.50. Can you consider that?",112.5,Bob,4,
