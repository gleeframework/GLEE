**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Alice further, accepting at $775,000 is a good outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** We're already saving $225,000 off Alice's initial asking price.
* **Below Our Maximum:** The price is comfortably below our $800,000 maximum. 
* **Negotiation Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming firmer on her price, or us missing out by going too low. John's offer is a safety net, not an ideal outcome.

This deal secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
