Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $150. Would it be possible to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $150 is better than $120, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $155 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's better than selling to John for $120."
