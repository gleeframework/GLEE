{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only comfortable with a price of $900,000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I've assessed for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,000,000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement closer to $950,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the potential of this product and the savings for you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incrementally closer:** This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price lower than Alice's.
* **Focus on value and savings:** The message reinforces the value of the product while highlighting the potential savings for Alice by accepting your offer.
* **Maintain pressure:** This keeps the negotiation moving towards your desired price point without completely shutting down the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective.  $950000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $975000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has significantly reduced her price from the initial $1,200,000, coming very close to your desired range.
* **Limited time:**  You've already used 5 rounds, leaving only 5 remaining. It's becoming more risky to keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could try to push for $950,000, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further reduction. 
* **Acceptable price:** $975,000 is within your budget and a good deal considering the value of the product. 

Accepting this offer balances the risk of missing out on a good deal with the potential for getting an even lower price."
