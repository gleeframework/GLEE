"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly more than Alice's perceived value of the product. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's room for negotiation, and you can likely secure a lower price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her perceived value of the product. 
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still space for Alice to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Maintaining your goal:**  This offer keeps you well within your budget and potentially saves you a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable:**  While it's still above your initial counteroffer, it's a significant decrease from her first offer and gets closer to your desired price.
* **Value vs. risk:**  Rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on unnecessarily.
* **Maintaining your goal:**  This offer still allows you to buy the product for less than your maximum budget, saving you a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
