"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand it's a good product. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
