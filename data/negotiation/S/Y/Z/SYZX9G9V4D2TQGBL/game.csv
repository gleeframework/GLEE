"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your budget considerations.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this still represents a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $2,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,950,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
