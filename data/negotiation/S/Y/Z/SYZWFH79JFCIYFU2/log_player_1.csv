Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,250,000 is still significantly less than my minimum value ($1,500,000), so I'm open to some negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  It gives me a chance to get a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoid Immediate Rejection:**  Starting too high could immediately lead to a rejection.
* **Keep the Negotiation Open:**  A reasonable offer allows for a back-and-forth exchange and potential for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows us both to make a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value,  it's still worth exploring further negotiation. 

* **Potential for Compromise:** I can try to meet him halfway or find a price that's more acceptable.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best outcome, but rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal alive.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum value while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000 for the product. This allows both of us to make a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,125,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial assessment of the product's worth, but it's closer to my minimum value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the benefits of this deal for both of us, encouraging a positive response.

This approach aims to:

* **Increase the Likelihood of Agreement:** By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and make a deal.
* **Maintain a Good Negotiation Position:** I'm still offering a price above Bob's initial offer, but I'm demonstrating flexibility.
* **Set the Stage for a Potential Final Offer:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can consider a final offer very close to my minimum value."
