"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is way above what I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $8000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to go as low as $13000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $13000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a good price for both of us.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $11500 is still pushing it.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,8,
