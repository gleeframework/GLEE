"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we value it at $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the value we place on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we try $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value we place on this product, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
