"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering the product to you for $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,000,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $1,200,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.
