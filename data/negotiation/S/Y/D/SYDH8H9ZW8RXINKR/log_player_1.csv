I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I believe this is a strong starting point to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe there's room for negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for potential profit beyond my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'm still hopeful for a better price, the risk of further negotiation dragging on is too high.  It's safer to take John's offer of $1,200,000, which is my minimum acceptable value and guarantees a successful transaction."
