Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something of its value."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchor Bias:** By starting at $12,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than $8,000.  Even if he doesn't accept this initial price, it sets a higher baseline for negotiation.
* **Backup Offer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell, so you can afford to be more assertive in your pricing.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Observe his reactions and be ready to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your $8,000 minimum in mind."
