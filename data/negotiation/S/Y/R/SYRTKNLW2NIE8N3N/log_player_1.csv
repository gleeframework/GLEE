Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price. This gives her room to start high.
* **Anchor High:** By starting at $19,000, Alice sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting price increases the perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message implies Alice is open to discussion, which can be more inviting than a firm, take-it-or-leave-it approach. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:**  This strategy assumes Alice has some understanding of the market and Bob's potential willingness to pay. If this is a unique product or Bob is known to be a tough negotiator, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for the highest profit is key, Alice should consider the long-term implications. If she wants to build a relationship with Bob for future business, a less aggressive approach might be more beneficial."
