"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $90, how about we meet at $75? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save some money.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we try $85? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I think we can do better than $85. How about $82? That's the most I'm willing to pay for this product.",82.0,Bob,6,
