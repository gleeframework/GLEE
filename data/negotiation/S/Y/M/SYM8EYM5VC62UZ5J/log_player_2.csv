Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product to the right buyer is significant, and $1,100,000 is well below my minimum. To make this work, I could consider $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.
