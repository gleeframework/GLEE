Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which may help Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $75? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm proposing a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price.  I'm also emphasizing a win-win scenario to make Bob feel more positive about the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $72 is a more reasonable price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $72 is above my minimum value of $80. It's likely that Bob is unwilling to go higher, and continuing the negotiation could lead to a deadlock. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
