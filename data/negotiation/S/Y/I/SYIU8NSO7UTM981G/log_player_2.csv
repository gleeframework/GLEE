"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but clearly states that the initial price is too high.
* **Justification:** Suggesting a price ""in the middle"" provides a reason for the counteroffer, even if it's not exactly the midpoint. 
* **Goal in Mind:** The ultimate goal is to pay as close to $120 as possible (John's price) without losing the opportunity to buy from Alice if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $160 is still significantly higher than John's price of $120. There's room for negotiation. 
* **Downward Trend:**  Alice reduced her price, indicating she's open to negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  By rejecting this offer, we can encourage Alice to move closer to a price point that works for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $160 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $110. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Instead of jumping straight to $120 (John's price), we're incrementally increasing our offer to show Alice we're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Target Price:** $110 gets us very close to our ideal price while leaving some room for a final counteroffer from Alice, should she choose to make one.
* **Clear Communication:** The message directly states our target price range and seeks a clear response from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $150 is the absolute lowest I can go for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has stated $150 is her absolute lowest price. 
* **Better Alternative:** John offers the product for $120, which is significantly cheaper than Alice's final offer. 
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  Further counteroffers are unlikely to bridge the $30 gap, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at the lower price."
