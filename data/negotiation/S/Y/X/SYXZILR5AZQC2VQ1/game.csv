"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you a lot of benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product and I need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, Alice, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price to $11,500, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I can offer you a one-time concession of $200, so I'll meet you at $11,800. That's the lowest I can go.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  It seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,400?",11400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I was thinking we could meet at $11,600, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",11600.0,Alice,7,
