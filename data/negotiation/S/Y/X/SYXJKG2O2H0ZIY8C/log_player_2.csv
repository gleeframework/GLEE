# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is considerably below its value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $17,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm comfortable offering $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm motivated to find a solution. How about we settle on $15,500? This allows me to make a fair profit and ensures you're getting a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $15,500 is still higher than my budget. It's not worth continuing to negotiate since John is offering a much better price at $10,000. It's best to cut my losses and buy from John."
