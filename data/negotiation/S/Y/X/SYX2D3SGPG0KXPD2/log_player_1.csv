"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting.  This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully close the deal at a price closer to my target of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  There's still potential for a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my initial offer by a significant margin, but still remaining above Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than he's offering.  This should encourage him to come closer to my desired price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to keep negotiating to try and secure a better deal. With John as a backup, I'm in a good position to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. This demonstrates that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value just yet.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting frustratingly low, but it's still not enough to consider selling. With John as a backup, I can afford to be a little more stubborn. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before seriously considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm reducing my price again, showing flexibility, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that this is a good deal for him, considering the product's worth to him is $1,000,000. If he rejects this offer, I'll move to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I would love to close the deal with Bob, time is running out, and I'm close to my minimum acceptable value.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John.  This is a good outcome, as I'm able to achieve my target price."
