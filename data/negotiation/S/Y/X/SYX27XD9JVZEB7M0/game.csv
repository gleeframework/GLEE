"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think the product is worth more than $11,000 to me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
