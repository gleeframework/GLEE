Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I need to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping that this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $12,000. Since John is offering me my minimum, I'll take his offer."
