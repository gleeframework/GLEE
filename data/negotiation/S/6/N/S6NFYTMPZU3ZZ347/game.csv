"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $110, which would be $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $120, which is the midpoint between $110 and $130. Can we agree on that price?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $125, which is a bit above your target but still a good compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to stick with my previous counteroffer of $120. Can we agree on that price?",120.0,Bob,6,
