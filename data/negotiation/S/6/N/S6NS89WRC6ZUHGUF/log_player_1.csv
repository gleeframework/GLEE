Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing you closer to your desired profit margin.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you are secure knowing John will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price."
