The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $180. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to Alice, and I'm willing to buy it for $120."

Alice is now offering $160, which is still above my maximum value of $120.  It's better to buy from John for $120, as it's a better deal."
