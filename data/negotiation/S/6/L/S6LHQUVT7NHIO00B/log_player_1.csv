"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it's worth a lot more than my asking price of $120."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price, and while I could counter, there's a risk he'll drag out the negotiation or never offer more than $100. John offers a guaranteed $100, which meets my minimum. It's best to take the sure thing."
