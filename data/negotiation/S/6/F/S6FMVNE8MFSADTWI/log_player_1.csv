Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000, starting high gives you room to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Objective:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 if he declines."
