"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit. If you're not willing to go up, I may have to consider selling to someone else. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
