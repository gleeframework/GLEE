"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000? This price reflects the true potential of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
