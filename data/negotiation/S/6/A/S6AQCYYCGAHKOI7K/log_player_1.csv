Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a good price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,900,000 represents the high-end of its value, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000? This price reflects the true potential of the product."", ""product_price"": 1650000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge significantly from his $1,400,000 offer.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely to yield a result significantly better than what John is already offering.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
