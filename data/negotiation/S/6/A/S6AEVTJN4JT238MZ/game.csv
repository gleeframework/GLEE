"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10800.

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $10000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable selling the product at a price that doesn't reflect its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer the product to you for $10100. This is my final offer.",10100.0,Alice,9,
