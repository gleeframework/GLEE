"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $80 valuation."
