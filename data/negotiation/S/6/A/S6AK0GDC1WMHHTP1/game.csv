"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this deal work.",105.0,Bob,4,
