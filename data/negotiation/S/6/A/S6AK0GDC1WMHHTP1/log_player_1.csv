{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining.  It also highlights the value Bob would gain by accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is a good deal, I can likely get closer to my desired price range by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $120, Bob's offer of $105 is a fair compromise.  It's above my minimum of $80 and allows me to close the deal without risking losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer."
