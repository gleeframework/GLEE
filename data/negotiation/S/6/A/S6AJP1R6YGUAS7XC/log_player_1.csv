Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price point. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than the $100 backup offer from John."
