"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,000? I'm ready to buy if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to come down another $500 and offer it to you for $7,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,5,
