# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $1,000,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget. You can still try to negotiate further, especially since you have the option to buy from John at a lower price."
