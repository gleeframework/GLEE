Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the deal being good for *both* of us, which encourages cooperation.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price leaves room for me to make concessions if necessary, while still earning significantly more than my minimum.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup, which gives me leverage. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Leverage:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm better off making a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. It's likely Bob will be willing to go a little higher, especially since I have a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try $925,000.  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the price as still being a good deal for Bob while emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value. 

Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  We've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear Bob is not willing to budge much.  Continuing to negotiate will cost me time and potentially reduce my profits. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, which is more financially beneficial than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
