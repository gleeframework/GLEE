"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $18,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, as I have a backup option for the same product at that price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my initial offer. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my backup option.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is a $1,000 decrease from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and my existing backup option. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable conclusion.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $9,500, which is a $500 decrease from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make it work.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is a significant compromise for me. This price reflects the value of the product to me, the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, and my backup option.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm running out of room to maneuver. I'll meet you at $9,500 was too high, but I can do $9,000 was too low, so I'll meet you in the middle of that, at $9,250 was a good compromise, so I'll meet you at $9,375, which is $25 less than my previous offer. I think this is as low as I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",9375.0,Alice,9,
