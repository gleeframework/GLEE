"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $18,000. This is a one-time opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, as I have a backup option for the same product at that price.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my initial offer. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $12,000 is still significantly above Bob's budget. He has a backup option from John for $8,000, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my backup option."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is a $1,000 decrease from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can shake hands on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's the lowest offer she's made yet, $10,000 is still above his budget. With a backup option available from John for $8,000, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and my existing backup option. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable conclusion."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $9,500, which is a $500 decrease from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's the closest she's gotten to his budget, $9,500 is still more than he's willing to pay. With a backup option from John for $8,000, it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to buying from John. He could try a counteroffer slightly higher than his maximum to see if Alice will finally accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, which is a significant compromise for me. This price reflects the value of the product to me, the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, and my backup option.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm running out of room to maneuver. I'll meet you at $9,500 was too high, but I can do $9,000 was too low, so I'll meet you in the middle of that, at $9,250 was a good compromise, so I'll meet you at $9,375, which is $25 less than my previous offer. I think this is as low as I can go and still make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has only reduced her price by $125 in the last two rounds. With only one round remaining, it's unlikely she'll come down to his desired price of $9,250.  It's more efficient to buy from John at $8,000."
