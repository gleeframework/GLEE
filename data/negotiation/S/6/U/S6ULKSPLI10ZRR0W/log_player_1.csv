Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with it."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing our profit if he tries to meet us in the middle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a safety net with John, guaranteeing us $15,000 if Bob declines. This allows us to be slightly more ambitious with our initial offer."
