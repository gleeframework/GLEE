"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500? I feel this is a reasonable compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet at $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
