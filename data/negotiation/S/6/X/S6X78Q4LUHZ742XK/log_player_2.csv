Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $7,800. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I think it's a good compromise.

Alice has come down to $7,800, which is only $200 more than your counteroffer. This is a good deal for you considering your maximum budget is $8,000 and you can save $200."
