"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. My starting price is $170."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable offer:** While $170 is above Bob's value, it's not unreasonable considering my own value for the product. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I can make concessions later if necessary without feeling like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I can likely get a better price than $120 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $150, it's better to explore if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price range, potentially around $140, and explain why it's still a good deal for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing that it's a good deal for him.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer again if he wants to, but also suggests a potential end point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he's showing interest.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I'd rather continue with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his last offer, potentially around $135, explaining that I'm flexible but also need to get a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet at $135? This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. I'm open to a final compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my original asking price. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value.
* **Open to a final compromise:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer one last time if needed, but also signaling that I'm ready to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you at $125. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We've already had several rounds of negotiation, and Bob's offer is not moving much closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is the best option:** John is willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

While it's frustrating to not get closer to my desired price, I'm prioritizing securing a deal that meets my minimum."
