Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it directly to Bob might lead to a quicker sale than waiting for John, even if the final price is slightly lower."
