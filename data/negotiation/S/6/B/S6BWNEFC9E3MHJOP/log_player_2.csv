"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's reasonably close to Alice's initial price, but still significantly lower than her offer. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's willing to negotiate.  By offering $105, he's leaving room for potential further negotiation while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than he's comfortable paying. He wants to save as much money as possible and still has a few rounds to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, he can continue exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $115 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, as I'm confident it's a good value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving money while still showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product. By offering $110, he's meeting Alice halfway from his previous offer and demonstrating his willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible and has a few more rounds to negotiate. While $112.50 is closer to his target, he can still try to get a lower price.  Since Alice states this is her final offer, he'll likely have to make a counteroffer. He's still willing to pay more than his initial offer, but only if he can get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit over my budget at $112.50. How about we split the difference and settle on $111.25? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but this time he's focusing on a compromise.  By offering to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer, he's showing a willingness to meet halfway. This approach could be more appealing to Alice than a flat rejection, potentially increasing the likelihood of a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'll meet you halfway between $112.50 and $111.25. I'll sell the product to you for $111.75. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where he needs to consider the remaining rounds. Accepting the offer at $111.75 allows him to save money compared to buying from John for $120. He's also already made several counteroffers and may not have much leverage left to negotiate a lower price. 

This is a good compromise for Bob, as he's still able to secure the product for a price within his budget,  and it avoids the risk of the negotiation completely falling apart."
