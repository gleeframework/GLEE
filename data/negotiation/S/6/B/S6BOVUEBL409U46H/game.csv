,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. How about $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll be forced to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
