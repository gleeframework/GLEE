"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 represents a fair starting point given the product's potential, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
