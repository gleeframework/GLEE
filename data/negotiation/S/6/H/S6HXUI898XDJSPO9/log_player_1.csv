"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me on the price. That said, $1,150,000 is still a little steep.  Could you do $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about we settle at $1,080,000?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $1,080,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for $1,060,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price by a significant margin and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
