"Alice, your offer of $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for this product. This is a fair price, given my assessment of its value and market conditions.  Let's start with that, and we can see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique value proposition of this product. ",1800000.0,Alice,3,
