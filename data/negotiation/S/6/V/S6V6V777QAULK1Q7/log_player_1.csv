"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'd find very valuable. My asking price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to get a good price while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $130 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I'm offering a compromise price, closer to my desired price point but still leaving room for a potential agreement. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. How about we meet at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $132 is getting very close and represents a significant profit for me.  Accepting his offer is the most strategic move at this point. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
