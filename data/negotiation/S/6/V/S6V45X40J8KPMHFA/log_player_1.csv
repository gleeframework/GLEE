Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Explanation:

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $1,200,000.  While further negotiation is possible, it's highly unlikely Bob will suddenly increase his offer by $400,000. 

Accepting Bob's offer means a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. Therefore, cutting negotiations and selling to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000 is the most profitable decision."
