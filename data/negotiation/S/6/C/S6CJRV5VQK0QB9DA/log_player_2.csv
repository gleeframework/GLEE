"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I propose a price of $12000 for the product. This price not only ensures a fair return for us but also offers you a significant saving compared to its intrinsic worth of $10000. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $10,000."
