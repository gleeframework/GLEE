"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it's worth the price I'm asking. How about we compromise at $1,300,000?  This would still give you a significant benefit and allow me to get closer to my target price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
