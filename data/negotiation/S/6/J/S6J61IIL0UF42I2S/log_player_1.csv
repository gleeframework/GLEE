Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's still too early to sell to John, as I can likely get closer to my minimum with a counteroffer to Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $900000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer of $900,000 is close to my minimum of $1,200,000 and I want to close the deal. I'm willing to take the profit and move on."
