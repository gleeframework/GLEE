"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, Bob can do better. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a price closer to his $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $925000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his limit. Bob wants to save as much as possible.  He can likely push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
