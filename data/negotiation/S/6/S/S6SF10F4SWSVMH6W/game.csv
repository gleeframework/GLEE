"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still gives you a good return. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
