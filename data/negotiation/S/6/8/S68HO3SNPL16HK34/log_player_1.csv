{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer starts high, but it's important to signal to Bob that you're open to negotiation. This sets the stage for a potential counteroffer, which is where you can start to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $80 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $80 is better than nothing,  it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
