"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fair but Firm:** $175 is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's also higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps to build rapport and avoid starting the negotiation on a negative note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept such a drastic reduction in price.  There's still room to find a mutually beneficial price point. 
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150 provides me with leverage and gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving towards Bob's offer, but not drastically.  $160 is a compromise, but it still allows me to earn more than my minimum. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than he's offering, but that I'm being flexible. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm inviting Bob to continue the negotiation and hopefully agree to a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can afford. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $140 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  While I could potentially get a better price if I keep negotiating, there's a risk of Bob backing out or the deal falling apart. 
* **Time is Money:**  Every round that passes increases the risk of Bob getting a better deal elsewhere or me missing out on other opportunities.  
* **Sell to John as a Backup:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and avoiding further potential delays and risks."
