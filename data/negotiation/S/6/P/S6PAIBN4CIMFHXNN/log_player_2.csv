"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is less than John's offer, you know you can get the product for $100 from a guaranteed source. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price, getting you a better deal."
