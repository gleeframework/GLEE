"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm ready to buy, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
