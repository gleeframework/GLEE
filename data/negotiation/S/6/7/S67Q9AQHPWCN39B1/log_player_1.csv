"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a profit. It's important to show flexibility while also maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $85 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Let's try $87 this time. It's a fair compromise between our previous offers.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counter again, aiming to reach a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate with you, but $87 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $92. It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let's settle on $89. That's a reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $89 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget, but I still need to get a little bit more for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $91?  It's a fair compromise and keeps the deal moving."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your efforts. Let's try $88. It's a step closer to your initial offer and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  With only two rounds left, it's getting risky to continue. I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John for $100 is a safe and guaranteed way to maximize my earnings."
