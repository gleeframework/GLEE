Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a courtesy. I believe it holds significant value and am willing to part with it for $20,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is framed politely, acknowledging Bob's position as a potential buyer."
