"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $82.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make at least $81.50 to make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can come to an agreement.",81.5,Alice,5,
