"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially getting closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's possible Alice will reject this offer, it starts the negotiation process and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is within Bob's budget of $10,000.  While Bob would ideally prefer to pay closer to $10,000, accepting this offer allows him to buy the product and avoids the potential risk of further negotiation with Alice. If Alice rejects this offer, there is no guarantee that she will come down further in price, and Bob could end up paying more or needing to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's willing to pay."
