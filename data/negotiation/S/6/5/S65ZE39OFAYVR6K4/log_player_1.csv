Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential worth."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $8,000 (your guaranteed price from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it for $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. It also offers Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Sale:** The price is attractive to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
2. **Maximize Profit:** $12,000 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price."
