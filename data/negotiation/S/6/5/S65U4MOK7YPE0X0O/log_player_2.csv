Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by you, but I'll consider your budget. My initial offer is $140. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $150**.  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to negotiate.**  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $130?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
