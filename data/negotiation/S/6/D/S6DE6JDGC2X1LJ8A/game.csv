"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. How about $11,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering its worth to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
