Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1675000} 
```

I'm countering with a price of $1,675,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's important to remember that negotiating takes time and effort, and sometimes it's better to accept a good offer rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
