"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum amount he's willing to pay, which is still less than my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation that would benefit me. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without the risk of further haggling."
