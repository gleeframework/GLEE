"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you showing me this product. While I think it's great, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
