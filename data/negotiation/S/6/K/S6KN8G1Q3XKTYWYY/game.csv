"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really hoping to get this for $85. If you're willing to consider that, I'm ready to make a deal.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
