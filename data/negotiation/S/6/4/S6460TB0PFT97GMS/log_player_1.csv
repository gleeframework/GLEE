Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum acceptable price:** I won't sell for less than $8,000, so $10,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has incentive to negotiate and potentially accept my offer.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a reason to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and his offer of $9,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum. I believe this is a strong position to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my ideal price, and it's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further rejection or a lower price."
