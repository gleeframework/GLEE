Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting me a good price. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him. However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept that low of an offer just yet. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $150, but it also gets me closer to my desired price. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."
