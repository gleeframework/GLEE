,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,200 is still too low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $7,800. This is my final offer.  What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
