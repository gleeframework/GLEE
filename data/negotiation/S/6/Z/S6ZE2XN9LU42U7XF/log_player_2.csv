**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.** You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have 9 more rounds to negotiate.** There's a good chance you can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  He's offering the product at your maximum price, so you only want to go that route if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
