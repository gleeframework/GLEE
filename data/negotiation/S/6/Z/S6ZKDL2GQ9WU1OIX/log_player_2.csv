**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's consistently staying above your $80 maximum budget.  At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price you find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs, so it's time to cut your losses with Alice and move on."
