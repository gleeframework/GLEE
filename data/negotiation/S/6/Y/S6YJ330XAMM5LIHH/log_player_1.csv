"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. I believe a $15,000 offer is a fair starting point, but I'm prepared to lower the price if Bob counteroffers. I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm also mindful that I can sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $12,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get more, $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and Bob has offered that amount.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have the option to sell to John for the same price.  It's important to be realistic and secure a good deal, even if it's not the absolute best possible outcome."
