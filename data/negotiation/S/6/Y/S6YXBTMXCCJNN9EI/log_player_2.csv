Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this game-changing technology.

You should reject Alice's offer again. While she's come down a bit, $925,000 is still too high. Keep negotiating and aim for a price closer to your ideal range. You have more room to lower the price before you need to consider buying from John."

Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $915,000.

While Alice is coming down in price, $915,000 is still too high.  You're getting closer to your ideal price range, but it's worth continuing to negotiate for a slightly lower price.  You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice than buying from John."
