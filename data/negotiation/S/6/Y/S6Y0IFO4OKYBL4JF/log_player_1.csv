Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
