"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  Given its value, I think a starting price of $13,500 feels fair.  What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me is around $8,000 to you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  The value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go for now. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your coming up slightly. To be fair,  $11,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'd hoped. How about we split the difference again and settle on $11,875?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
