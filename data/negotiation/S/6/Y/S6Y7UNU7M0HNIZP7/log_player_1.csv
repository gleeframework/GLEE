I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. 

The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and we're not getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm still hopeful we could reach a deal,  John is offering a price that's well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather take the sure thing and sell to John."
