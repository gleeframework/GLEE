"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is substantial, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is significantly lower than buying from John for $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up buying from John is high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal for Bob."
