Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair offer:** It's below your minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise, which encourages Bob to engage.
* **It frames the negotiation positively:** You emphasize finding a price that works for both of you. 

Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John at any time if you don't feel the negotiations are going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a sale, it's not a good deal for you. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay you $15,000. It's worth exploring further negotiations with Bob to see if you can reach a more profitable price for yourself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $12,000? It's still a significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $11,250? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,250 is closer to your minimum price of $15,000, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay you $15,000, so it's worth pushing for a higher price with Bob.  

It's important to remember that you don't have to settle for an offer that doesn't meet your needs. Continue negotiating with Bob to see if you can reach a better price for yourself."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue exploring a fair price. However, $11,250 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $12,500 as a final offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product for a reasonable price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
