"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know you value it at that price as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get to make a little extra.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to pay more than you have to."
