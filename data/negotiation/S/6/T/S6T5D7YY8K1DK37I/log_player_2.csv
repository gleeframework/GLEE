"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is a discount from the product's true value, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the same product from John for a lower price of $800,000."
