{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, and only two rounds remain. The negotiation is taking longer than I expected.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is expressing commitment, his offer is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to compromise on that.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially not securing a deal at all.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit within limited time:** Selling to John guarantees a minimum profit of $1,000,000, which is still a significant amount.
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  It's not clear if further negotiation will lead to a better outcome. The risk of not reaching a deal outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.
* **Protect my interests:**  Selling to John ensures that I won't be left with the product and no sale.

**Next steps:**

* I'll reach out to John and finalize the sale. 
* While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I've secured a good profit and minimized the risk of ending up with a product I can't sell."
