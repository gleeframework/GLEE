{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it holds immense value, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows Bob to perceive a potential deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's worth to justify the high price. This can pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer more seriously.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in further negotiation. 

By starting high and demonstrating confidence in the product's value, I aim to set a strong starting point and maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is very interesting, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I am not compelled to accept it immediately. My goal is to maximize profit, and there's a chance I can negotiate a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show I'm not desperate:**  This indicates that I value the product highly and am not willing to settle for the first offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting gives me the power to propose a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's commitment:** Observing Bob's response to my counteroffer will reveal how serious he is about acquiring the product. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,750,000?  This represents a significant discount from my original offer, but it still reflects the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Constraints:** I acknowledge Bob's financial limitations to show empathy and build rapport.
* **Compromise & Justification:** I present a counteroffer that is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's initial offer. I justify this price as a ""significant discount"" to emphasize flexibility.
* **Focus on Finding Common Ground:** The message ends on a positive note, emphasizing the desire to find a mutually agreeable price.

This approach aims to:

* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  Demonstrating flexibility shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product to him.
* **Offer a reasonable compromise:** $1,750,000 is a midpoint between our initial positions, making it a more appealing option for both parties.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** By emphasizing finding common ground, I encourage Bob to continue the discussion and potentially accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $1625000.  This feels like a fair price, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart completely.

Here's why I'm accepting Bob's offer:

* **Close to Minimum:**  The offer is only $125,000 below my minimum, a relatively small difference considering the overall price. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Further negotiation could lead to more rounds and delays, increasing the chance that Bob will change his mind or that a better offer from another buyer will emerge. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing too hard could lead Bob to walk away entirely, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $1,500,000.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit that's only slightly below my ideal outcome. It's a calculated risk that minimizes potential losses."
