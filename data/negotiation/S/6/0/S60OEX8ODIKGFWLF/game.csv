"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
