{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a good profit. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I get closer to my target price. The message reiterates my understanding of Bob's perspective while highlighting the value of the product."
