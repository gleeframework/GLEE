Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This revised offer reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I still think it's a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my acceptable price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer.  I'll counter again, but I need to start considering if the increments are worth potentially losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of this product and its potential for your business."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at $1,000,000. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about this being my final offer, but it still gives me some wiggle room if he's willing to come up a bit more.  It's getting risky to keep declining, as I need to factor in the potential of losing John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $975,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving in the right direction, and while not ideal, $975,000 is a substantial amount. It's becoming riskier to continue pushing for more, as Bob might walk away, and I'd lose both offers. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing everything."
