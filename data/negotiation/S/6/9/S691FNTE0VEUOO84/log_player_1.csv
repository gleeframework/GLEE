Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than what Bob values the product at ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Reasoning:** My message includes a rationale for the price, framing it as a ""great deal"" and highlighting potential value to Bob.
* **Room to Compromise:**  The offer allows for potential negotiation down to a price closer to Bob's valuation without me sacrificing too much.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping John as a backup option, ensuring I won't be left with the product if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is too low:**  While Bob's offer is a serious offer, it's significantly below my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though Bob is trying to ""meet me halfway,"" his offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can get a better price.
* **John is a safe backup:** Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find it a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Toward the Middle:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so it's not a bad deal for me.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm suggesting ""splitting the difference"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a deal.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a good value for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's not worth the risk of further rejection.
* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further could take time and potentially lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired minimum value, which is a safe and reliable outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Given the closeness to my minimum value and the availability of a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm choosing to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
