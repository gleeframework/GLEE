"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find it a good value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a good value for the product",9750.0,Bob,4,
