# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its true value to you is $800,000. It's a win-win situation, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $200,000 less. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John and save a significant amount."
