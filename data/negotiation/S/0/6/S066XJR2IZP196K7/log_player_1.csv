Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $17,000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob seems anchored at $12,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable.  It's time to move on to John who is offering a guaranteed $15,000."
