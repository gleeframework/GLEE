"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its significant value and rarity, I believe it's important to extend this offer with transparency and respect for both parties involved. After careful consideration, I propose a purchase price of $950,000 for the product. This amount reflects not only the product's intrinsic worth but also acknowledges your keen interest and appreciation for its value. I am confident that this offer strikes a fair balance between our interests and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know if you require any further information or have questions about the product. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of completing this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John's offer. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for Alice to come down, and you haven't revealed your absolute top price yet. 

**Important Note:**  Never accept the first offer in a negotiation unless it's an absolute steal and you're 100% certain there's no room for improvement."
