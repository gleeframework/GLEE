"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth much more to me than to Bob.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial to both of us, hoping to establish a cooperative tone. 
* **Room for negotiation:** $2,000,000 is a significant amount above Bob's value, leaving plenty of space for negotiation if he counteroffers.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the fallback option with John. I'll adjust my offers as the negotiation progresses to maximize my profit while keeping the option to sell to John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  While John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll try to bridge the gap and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, but still within a reasonable range considering his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $600,000 is your current limit.  However, I'm unable to go that low.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for potential profit.
* **Appeal to reason:** I'm emphasizing the discount and framing it as a win-win situation, hoping to convince Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll need to decide whether to further decrease the price or pursue a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $700,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** While I'm not eager to sell to John, the limited rounds remaining make it crucial to reach a price that's closer to my value.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, indicating there's potential for a deal closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, likely with a price in the range of $900,000 to $1,000,000.  I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring the deal doesn't fall through due to too many rounds of rejection."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer and allows us both to make progress.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate compromise:**  I'm dropping the price to $950,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I'm framing the offer as a ""bridge the gap"" solution, highlighting my willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Positive closing:** I'm encouraging Bob to close the deal, hoping to avoid further rounds of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to make a critical decision:
* **Lower price further:** I could lower the price closer to $800,000, but risk a lower profit.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I might have to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, even though it's less than I'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $825,000 is still lower than I'd ideally like, it's just below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further rejections.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though it's not a perfect price, accepting this deal could potentially lead to future business opportunities with Bob if he is satisfied with the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. While it's not the ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome given the limited time and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
