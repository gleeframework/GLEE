"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $600,000 is your current limit.  However, I'm unable to go that low.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $700,000 is still far below what this product is worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant drop from my last offer and allows us both to make progress.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This keeps us both reasonably close to our desired outcomes.",825000.0,Bob,6,
