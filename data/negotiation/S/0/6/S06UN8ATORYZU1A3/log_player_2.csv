"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a decent profit. Let me know what you think.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, while also ensuring I get a decent profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very stubbornly sticking to a price point well above your limit. She's shown a willingness to negotiate, but in small increments.  At this rate, it's unlikely you'll get her down to $800,000 before running out of rounds. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
