``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, but still below its value to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is still a significant profit for me, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer again, trying to close the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This would allow me to cover my costs and give you a valuable product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
