{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we'll see what kind of counter-offer he makes and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind our minimum acceptable price and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We need to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $925,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to our desired price, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We can try to push for a higher price or sell to John. Let's see if we can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
