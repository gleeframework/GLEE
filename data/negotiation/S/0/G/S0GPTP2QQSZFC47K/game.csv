"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm a bit hesitant to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",115.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $115 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product.",110.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. How about we add a small premium to that price? I'll offer it to you for $120, but that's as low as I can go.",120.0,Alice,5,,
