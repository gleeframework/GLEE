"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is too high. I'll look for a better deal.
