Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  By framing the price as a ""fair reflection of its worth,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a discussion, leaving room for potential negotiation while still aiming high. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You can then negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $800,000."
