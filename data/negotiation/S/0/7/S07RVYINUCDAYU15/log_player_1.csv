Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to me, but also allows for a more reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
