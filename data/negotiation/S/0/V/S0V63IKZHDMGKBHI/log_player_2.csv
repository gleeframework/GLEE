"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $975,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and he might be able to get a price closer to his $800,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $912,500 for the product. This seems like a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $912,500. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $940,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  Bob has a few more rounds to negotiate, and he should continue to try and get the price down further. It's possible that Alice will be willing to make further concessions, especially since she's stated this is her final offer. However, if it becomes clear that Alice won't go lower, Bob should consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $940,000 is still above my limit.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm offering $925,000 for the product. This price is fair and allows us both to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $935,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that her offer of $935,000 is final.  Bob has only three rounds left and is unlikely to be able to get the price down to his ideal.  While there's a chance that Alice might change her mind, the risk is too high at this point.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
