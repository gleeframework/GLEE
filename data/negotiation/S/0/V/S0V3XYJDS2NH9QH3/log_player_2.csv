"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to get the price down.  $100 is closer, but you can likely do better with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $90?  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're very close to your target price of $80.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer may help you reach an agreement even lower than $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $92? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $98. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've made several counteroffers and Alice is still unwilling to go below $98. You're only two rounds away from potentially having to buy the product from John for $80, and while you can try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed you'll get a better price with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you get the product for your maximum price, and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
