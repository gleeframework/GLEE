"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get a better deal. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $1050000.  This would still give you a healthy profit, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $1125000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
