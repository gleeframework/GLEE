"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still above my budget.  I could meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
