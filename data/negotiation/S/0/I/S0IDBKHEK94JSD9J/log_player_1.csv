"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum target ($1,500,000) by the end of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly below my minimum target.  I'm not ready to give up on a better price just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can push the price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and hopefully get Bob closer to my desired price point. $1,350,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's within Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum target, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not ready to give up on securing a higher profit yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round to try and push the price up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering a compromise price of $1,300,000. This keeps the negotiations moving forward, but I'm still trying to inch closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll pay $1,275,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,275,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. With only 4 rounds left, I want to see if I can still squeeze out a better deal with Bob. I'll counteroffer one last time before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1,275,000 is still too low for me. This is my final offer: $1,325,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a final counteroffer. It's a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility.  However, it's still within my acceptable range and leaves a decent profit margin. If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. With only three rounds left, I need to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'll make one more offer: $1,280,000. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk missing out on a guaranteed higher price from John.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000."
