,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $1,275,000 is still too low for me. This is my final offer: $1,325,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'll make one more offer: $1,280,000. This is my final offer. If you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1280000.0,Bob,8,
