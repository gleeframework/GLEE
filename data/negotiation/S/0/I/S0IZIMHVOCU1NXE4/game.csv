"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  That way we both get a fair price.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you've been great to negotiate with and I appreciate you splitting the difference.  How about we settle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,6,
