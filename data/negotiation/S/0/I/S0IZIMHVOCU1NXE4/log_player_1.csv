Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if needed.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** This increases Bob's chances of making a counteroffer, giving you more leverage.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to take the $6,500, it would be a significant loss for you. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your negotiating position:**  Show Bob you're not desperate to sell for a low price.
* **Explore other options:** You can either counteroffer Bob or, if his counteroffer isn't good enough, move on to John who will offer your desired price.

**Next steps:** You can either:

* **Counteroffer:** Offer a price higher than $6,500, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. Aim for a price closer to your desired $10,000. 
* **Sell to John:** If you think you won't get a better price from Bob, take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a higher price:**  This shows Bob you're willing to negotiate, but you're not willing to settle for a drastically lower price.
* **Reasoning behind the price:** Explaining why $8,500 is a fair price can be persuasive, especially if you can highlight the product's value or the costs you incurred.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion, encouraging Bob to consider your offer and potentially make a counteroffer closer to your price.

**Important:**  You can adjust the counteroffer amount based on your own risk tolerance and how badly you need to sell the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it's not worth risking a lower price with Bob, especially since you've already lowered your price from $10,000 to $8,500.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  You can counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $8,500. You could try offering $7,500 to show your willingness to compromise while still protecting your profit margin. 
* **Sell to John:**  If you're not confident in getting a better price from Bob, you can accept John's offer of $12,000. This guarantees you your minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $7,500?  That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that shows you're willing to compromise while still protecting your interests.
* **Emphasize fairness:** Highlighting that $7,500 is a fair price for both parties can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  The message doesn't close the door on further negotiation, allowing for more flexibility if needed.

**Important:**

* You can adjust the counteroffer amount based on your risk tolerance and how determined you are to sell to Bob.
* If you feel confident that Bob will accept this offer, you can also add a phrase like, ""This is my final offer."" to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you've been great to negotiate with and I appreciate you splitting the difference.  How about we settle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to your desired price, $7,250 is still a significant loss for you. You've already been very flexible with your price, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher. 

Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob. This ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and saves you the time and effort of potentially going through more rounds of negotiation."
