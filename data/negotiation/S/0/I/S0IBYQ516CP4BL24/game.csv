"I appreciate the unique features and benefits of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to consider a price in this range, but I'd need to see a significant reduction from the original offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your target price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1400000. This is a significant reduction from the original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $900000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to reflect the product's true value. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $1100000. This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price for the product's unique features and benefits. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1100000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $850000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I still need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $975000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",975000.0,Alice,7,
