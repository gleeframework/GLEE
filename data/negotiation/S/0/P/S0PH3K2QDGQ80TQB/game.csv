"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

I'll sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it holds for you.
