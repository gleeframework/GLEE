"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a price that's within your budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation with Alice to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your target price, you can still try to negotiate further to get it down to $1,300,000.  You can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to continuing our negotiation, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,340,000? This price is still within your budget and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

You should accept Alice's offer.  You are only $40,000 over your target price from John, and further negotiation might not get you a better price.  It's likely Alice will not budge much lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
