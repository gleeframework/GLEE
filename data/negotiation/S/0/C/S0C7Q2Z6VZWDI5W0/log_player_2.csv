"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $15,000 is not a good option.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately for $12,000 is a safe option, but Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob is still trying to get a better deal and $13,000 is still higher than his maximum price point. He can try to negotiate further with Alice. Buying from John is still a safe option but Bob is hoping to save more money by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price point,  he's already had four rounds of negotiation, and he's not sure if he'll be able to get Alice down to his desired price.  It's safer and faster to buy from John at this point."
