Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's try to make this work. How about $1,525,000? It's a small step towards your price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1525000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure we'll reach a deal that benefits me enough. John is a sure thing for $1,500,000, so I'm going to sell to him."
