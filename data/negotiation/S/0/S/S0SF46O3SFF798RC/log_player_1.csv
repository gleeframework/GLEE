"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $180.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $80. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $150. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's an increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $130. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe this price is still reasonable given my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not optimistic that Bob will come up to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John, even if it's just my minimum, than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
