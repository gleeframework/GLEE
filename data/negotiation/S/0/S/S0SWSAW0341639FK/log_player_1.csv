"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  If he doesn't, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to make more than $1,000,000 to justify selling to him.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also a higher price than Bob's offer, reflecting the value I place on the product. I believe this is a fair price that allows for a potential deal while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap further."

I'm now offering $1,250,000.  This is only $50,000 above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer as it's a good deal for both of us."
