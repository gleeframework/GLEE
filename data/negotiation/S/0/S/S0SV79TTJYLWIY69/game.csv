,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $22,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $18,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  My final offer is $15,000.  This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",15000.0,Alice,5,
