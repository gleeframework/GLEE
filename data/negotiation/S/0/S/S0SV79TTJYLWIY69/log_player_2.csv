Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  My final offer is $15,000.  This is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.

Alice is unlikely to go below her product's value of $15,000.  To maximize savings, it's best to buy from John at $10,000."
