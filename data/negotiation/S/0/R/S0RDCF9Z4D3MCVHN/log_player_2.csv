"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still a good deal for you, significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
