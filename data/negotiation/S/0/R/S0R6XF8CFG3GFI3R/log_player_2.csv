Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $110. How about we meet at $105, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While the extras are tempting, I'm sticking to my goal of spending under $100. I'll continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further in price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for $100. That's below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $105, and has even increased her offer this round.  It's not worth further negotiation as it's clear we won't reach a price I find acceptable. Buying from John for $120 ensures I get the product without further hassle and within my budget."
