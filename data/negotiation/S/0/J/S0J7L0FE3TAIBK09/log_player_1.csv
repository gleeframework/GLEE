Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum.  It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 and ensure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
