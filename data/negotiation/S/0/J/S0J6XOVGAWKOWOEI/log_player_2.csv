"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is a good price, but it's still possible to get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  It's also helpful to get a sense of Alice's bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $800,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and it's likely to spark a further negotiation.  This aggressive move gives Bob a better chance to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal target. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push Alice closer to his desired price point.  There are still several rounds left, providing opportunities to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a good position, Alice has already lowered her price once. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a deal but is also willing to compromise.  By offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, Bob demonstrates flexibility while still aiming to achieve a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $840,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  While it's still possible to continue negotiating,  it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, and it's a significant saving compared to buying from John. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might get stubborn or even walk away, leaving Bob with no deal. It's better to secure a favorable price now rather than risk a worse outcome."
