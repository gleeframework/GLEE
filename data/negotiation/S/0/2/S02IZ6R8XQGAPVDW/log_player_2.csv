"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget. He has several rounds to negotiate and get a better price, or he can simply buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $8,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $18,000 is significantly lower than my asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than his budget. He has more rounds to negotiate, and can always choose to buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $12,500.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above his budget.  He can get the product from John for a price that is within his budget. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
