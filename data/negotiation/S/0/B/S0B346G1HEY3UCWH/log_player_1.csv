Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $165.  I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 165
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Even though Bob values the product at $120, it's always good to start negotiations higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining or for Bob to accept a price higher than he initially intended.
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer of $165 is safely above your minimum of $150, ensuring a profit no matter what.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John willing to buy at $150. This allows you to be more confident in setting a higher price for Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential gain from a higher sale price to Bob often outweighs the risk of going straight to your backup buyer, John."
