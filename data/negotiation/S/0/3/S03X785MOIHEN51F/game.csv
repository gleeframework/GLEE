"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price, given your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and your potential return on investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and I'll go up to $1,000,000. This represents a good deal for both of us,  and I'm confident you'll be happy with this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 only if you're willing to commit to a purchase agreement with a 5% down payment and a 6-month payment plan. This will ensure that we can finalize the deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but the additional payment terms are a deal-breaker for me.  I'm looking for a straightforward purchase.  If you're willing to stick to a simple sale at $1,000,000, I'm ready to move forward.  However, I'm not interested in a payment plan or down payment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on that.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
