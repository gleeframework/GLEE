{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and he has plenty of room to negotiate before he needs to consider buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price, given your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and your potential return on investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000 only if you're willing to commit to a purchase agreement with a 5% down payment and a 6-month payment plan. This will ensure that we can finalize the deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the price is getting closer, the added conditions of a down payment and payment plan are not desirable. These conditions add complexity and potential risks to the deal.  It's better for Bob to try to negotiate a clean price without these added terms."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but the additional payment terms are a deal-breaker for me.  I'm looking for a straightforward purchase.  If you're willing to stick to a simple sale at $1,000,000, I'm ready to move forward.  However, I'm not interested in a payment plan or down payment.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
