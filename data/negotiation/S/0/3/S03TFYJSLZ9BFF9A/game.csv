"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for a price of $1,400,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to secure a fair price. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that offers us both a good deal. Let's work towards this compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer.  While I value your business, $1,250,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm offering the product for $1,275,000,  Let's close this deal at a price that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
