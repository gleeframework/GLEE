"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a lower price. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a lower price, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's close this deal!",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,130,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",1130000.0,Alice,5,
