"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $115 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my minimum of $120 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have time to negotiate and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
