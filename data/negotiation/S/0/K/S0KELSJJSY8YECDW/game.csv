"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $115 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great price for the product, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $90. Would that work for you?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
