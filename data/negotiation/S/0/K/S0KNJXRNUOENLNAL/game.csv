"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high price. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm still making a significant profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
