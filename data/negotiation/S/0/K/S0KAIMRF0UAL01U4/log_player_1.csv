"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal. However, I'm also keeping John's offer in mind and will be willing to adjust my price if necessary to close the deal with Bob before the 10 rounds are up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. I have 9 more rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $16,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still allowing me to earn a bit more than John's offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, I'm confident I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
