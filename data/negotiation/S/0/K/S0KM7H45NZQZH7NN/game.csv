"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but $12,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
