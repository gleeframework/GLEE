"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and significantly more than my minimum asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000?  It's a good compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not sure I can go lower than $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product. Let's aim for a win-win here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
