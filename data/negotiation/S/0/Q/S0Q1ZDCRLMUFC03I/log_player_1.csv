"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of getting closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm focusing on the product's benefits and suggesting a ""fair"" price. This creates a more positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $120 is a good starting point, it's still lower than what Bob is willing to pay. This shows I'm open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I think $90 would be a fair price for me given my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $80 from John, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe there's room for a little more negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a reason and proposing a compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:** $105 is halfway between my last offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90), demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $105, he's still getting a good deal compared to the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is very close to my desired price point, and it's significantly higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer allows me to maximize my profit while still maintaining a good relationship with Bob.  While I could potentially counteroffer again, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
