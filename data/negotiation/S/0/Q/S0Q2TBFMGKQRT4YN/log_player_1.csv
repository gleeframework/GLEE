Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room for negotiation above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you significant profit above your minimum while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might adjust the price slightly lower, leaving more room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer could be beneficial."
