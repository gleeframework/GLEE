"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm starting the offer at $11000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $9,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $10250. This is a fair price that allows us both to come out ahead. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $10,250 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He's better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. There's still room for both parties to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
