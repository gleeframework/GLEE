"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $90 for the product. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $97.50? That's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $97.50 is a good outcome. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. Holding out for more might result in losing him as a buyer altogether."
