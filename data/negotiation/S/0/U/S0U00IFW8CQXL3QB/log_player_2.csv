"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget, there's no incentive to negotiate. You can get the product from John for the same price."
