"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about we start at $1,050,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
