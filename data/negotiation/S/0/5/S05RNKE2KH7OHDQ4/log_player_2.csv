"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about we start at $1,050,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting and counter-offering again allows for more negotiation and potential for a better price.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a worse option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is now within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.  While there is still room for negotiation, the potential gains from further bargaining are likely to be small. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of Alice further raising her price or Bob running out of negotiation rounds."
