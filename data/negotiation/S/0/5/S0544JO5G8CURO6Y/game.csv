"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics about its nature right now, I assure you it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a price I believe reflects its potential value, but I'm open to discussing it further.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, so this is a limited-time opportunity. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
