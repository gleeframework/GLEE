"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $140 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I can meet you in the middle at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little out of my price range. I'm firm on $115, would you consider that?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit away from where I'd like to be. I can do $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is my absolute max. Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $122.50, which is the best I can do. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,7,
