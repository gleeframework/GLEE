"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I think this is a fair price that values the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not sure I can go up to $160. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $140? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
