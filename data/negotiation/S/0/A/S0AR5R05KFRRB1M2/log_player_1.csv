"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows for room to negotiate and still potentially secure a profit above my minimum value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames it as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to discuss the price, signaling flexibility. 
* **Round 1 Strategy:** In the first round, it's crucial to gauge Bob's interest without giving away too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum value, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and signals that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Exploring Higher Price:**  I believe I can still push for a better price, especially since I have 8 more rounds. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would secure a profit, but it's a suboptimal outcome compared to potentially getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $975,000?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  A counteroffer is the logical response to Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in completely.
* **Reasonable Increment:**  $975,000 is a moderate increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify my asking price.
* **Negotiation Focus:**  This counteroffer positions me to potentially reach a final agreement in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Agreement:**  Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point.  
* **Potential for Loss:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower offer from Bob, or even a rejection that would force me to sell to John at a significantly lower price.
* **Time Pressure:** With 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $960,000 is a good compromise, achieving a profit comfortably above my minimum value. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer maximizes my potential gain while minimizing the risk of losing a sale and ending up with the lower offer from John."
