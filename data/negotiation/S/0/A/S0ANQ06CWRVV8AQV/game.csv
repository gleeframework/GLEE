"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1400000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I've already made a significant concession by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to give you a small discount from my original price, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to maintain a profit margin, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about alternative options, and I'd hate to walk away from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
