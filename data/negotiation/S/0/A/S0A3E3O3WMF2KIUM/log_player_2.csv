You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still more than your budget, and you can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within your budget. It gives Alice room to negotiate, but also makes it clear you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."

{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows you're willing to meet halfway, but still aiming for a price closer to your budget."
