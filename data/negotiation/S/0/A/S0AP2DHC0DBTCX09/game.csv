"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $15500.  How about we meet in the middle at $16750? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know your thoughts.",16750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
