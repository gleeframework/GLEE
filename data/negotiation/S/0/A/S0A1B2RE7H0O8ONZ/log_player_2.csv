"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $9,000. There is room for negotiation.
* **You want to save money.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **You have time.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting this offer won't immediately force you to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant discount:**  My counteroffer is $2,000 less than Alice's initial price, showing a strong desire to negotiate.
* **Within my budget:** This price is still within my budget of $12,000.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While slightly lower than the initial offer, $9,500 is still a significant amount over my desired price.
* **I am willing to continue negotiating.**  I have time and believe there's still room for a more favorable deal.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  At this point, I am not yet willing to pay $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($9,500). This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Close to Alice's value:**  $8,000 is close to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($8,000), making this a potentially agreeable price for her.
* **Still saving money:**  This offer still allows me to save $4,000 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse.**  Each round, Alice is asking for a higher price, making this deal less attractive.
* **We are nearing the end of negotiations.**  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is mounting to reach a deal.
* **Buying from John is becoming more appealing.**  The gap between Alice's offer and John's price is narrowing, increasing the likelihood of buying from John. 

I need to hold out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can get Alice closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:**  This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I am nearing my limit. 
* **Testing Alice's limits:**  This counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects it, I will likely need to buy from John.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This offer offers a good potential savings ($3,500), but if Alice rejects it, I am taking a risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting too expensive.**  Each round, Alice's price increases, making the deal less appealing.
* **We are running out of time.**  Only three rounds remain, and I am unlikely to get a better offer from Alice.
* **Buying from John is the best option now.**  While John's price is high, it's a guaranteed deal, and I have a better chance of saving money in the long run than continuing to negotiate with Alice. 

I'm willing to take the hit on the higher price to ensure I get the product."
