"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can consider it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $975,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to accept $1,012,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Please let me know your decision.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can offer. I hope you can understand my position and consider this final counteroffer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
