Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at the highest possible price, so there's room for Bob to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer.
* If the negotiation drags on or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob and find a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:**  While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my ideal price point. I'll need to consider Bob's willingness to pay and my desire to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""good deal"") to create a more collaborative tone.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or sell to John.
* If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll likely sell to John. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating as long as I believe there's a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my desired price range. It's a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale without having to push for a higher price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely or delaying the sale, costing me valuable time and potentially lowering my overall profit. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale of the product."
