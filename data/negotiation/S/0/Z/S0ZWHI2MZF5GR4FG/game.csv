"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $60 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could we possibly settle around $75? I think that's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $90. It's a good price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
