"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
