Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,075,000?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}"

Bob's offer:

It's clear Bob is trying to negotiate a price significantly lower than what you know the product is worth. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to move much higher than his current offer. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of losing a profitable sale."
