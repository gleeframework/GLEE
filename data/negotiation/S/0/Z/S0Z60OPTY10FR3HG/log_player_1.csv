"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not in a rush, and I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $120 for it. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him closer to my desired price.  I'm feeling confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $130. That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $125. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$125 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it's Bob's final offer. However, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to budge in the next round.  I have five rounds left, so I have time to try and negotiate further. I'm also confident that I can sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance, but $125 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $127.50. This is my final offer before I move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```"
