"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $130. That's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
