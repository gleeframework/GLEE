"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it would be fair to propose a price of $800,000. This allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation. We should counter with a lower price to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $550,000?"",
""product_price"": 550000
}
```

This counter-offer aggressively targets a much lower price point, aiming to gauge Alice's flexibility. It also introduces a sense of budget limitation without outright revealing our absolute maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $650,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's time to nudge the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

We're inching closer to a potentially agreeable price. This counter-offer signals willingness to compromise but maintains pressure for a lower price.  The phrasing implies a degree of flexibility while staying firm on the general target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the negotiations so far, I am willing to offer the product at $625,000. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we can agree on. However, even a small difference matters. Let's push a little further and see if we can get it below $620,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting close, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $612,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 612500
}
```

This offer aims to make the negotiation feel collaborative while still aggressively targeting a lower price point. Suggesting a precise ""split the difference"" figure can sometimes create a sense of momentum towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I think a fair price would be $618,750. This offers a reasonable compromise while ensuring we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $618,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $618,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely we'll get a much better deal than this. Accepting at $618,750 secures a significant saving compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
