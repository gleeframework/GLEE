{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he's not, I can always lower my price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and it's better than selling to John. I'll accept it."
