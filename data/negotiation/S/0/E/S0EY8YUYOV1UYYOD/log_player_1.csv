""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but not unreasonably so allows room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it too close to $10,000 might make Bob balk, knowing Alice has a guaranteed $8,000 backup.  This price point creates urgency while still being appealing."
