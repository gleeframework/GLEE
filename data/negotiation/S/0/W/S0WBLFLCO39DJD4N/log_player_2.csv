Alice is negotiating, which is good, but I still think there's room to move closer to my target price. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on my target price. I'm willing to go a bit further to meet you, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1,025,000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller and I risk pushing the price higher or losing the deal altogether.  $1,025,000 is a good price and a significant savings from John's offer."
