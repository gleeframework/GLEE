"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the fact that I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is bluffing. You know the product's maximum worth to you is $10,000 and you have a guaranteed option to buy it at that price from John. There's no logical reason to pay Alice more."
