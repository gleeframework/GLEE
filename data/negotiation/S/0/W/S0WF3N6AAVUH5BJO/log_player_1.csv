Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is strategically sound. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to either accept a still-profitable deal or politely decline and move to John.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price point to Bob."
