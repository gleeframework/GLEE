Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still a good starting point that's above my minimum acceptable price. I'll be ready to counter if he rejects it, but I'm hoping to secure a sale quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $120, which is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer to try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while also ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still below what I'd prefer, but it's close to my minimum acceptable price and higher than John's offer. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and could result in a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
