"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's unlikely she'll walk away from a sale at this stage, and I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is higher than $6,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $7,200 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,800. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that $6,800 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you is $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $7,400. This is a reasonable compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is clearly committed to staying above $7,000.  I'll make one more attempt to sway her towards my preferred price point, but I may need to concede soon to avoid getting stuck with John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I've got to be honest, my budget is really tight around $6,800. I'm happy to make a deal today at that price, but I understand if that's not workable for you."",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,800 is a tough sell for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $7,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and we are running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get the product at a reasonable price without risking having to pay John's higher price."
