"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $15,500 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's worth considering.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $14,500? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to give up on my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $14,500, which would be $15,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,7,
