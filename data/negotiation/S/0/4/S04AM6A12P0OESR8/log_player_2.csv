The product is worth $100 to me, so I'm not willing to pay more than that. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $110?  It's still a fair price for me, and closer to your offer. Let me know what you think!

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  Even though she's been flexible, I'm going to go with John's offer and buy the product for $100."
