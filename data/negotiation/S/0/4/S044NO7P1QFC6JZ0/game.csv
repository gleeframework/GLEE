"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $8,500, Alice.  While that's closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $7,750 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,500. Would you consider $8,250?  It's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
