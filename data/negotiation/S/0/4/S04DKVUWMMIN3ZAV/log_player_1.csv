"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible deal. I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a good profit. I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, given that he rejected my previous offer and my product is worth $15,000 to him."
