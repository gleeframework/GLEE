Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a deal that's highly profitable. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial high price will be telling. It will give you insight into how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you have a strong alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,400,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and significantly less than your initial ask. There's room for negotiation. You have a strong alternative with John, so you're in a good position to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. Could you consider $1,700,000?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message communicates that you have other options (which strengthens your position) but are still genuinely interested in working with Bob.
* **Significant Drop:** The substantial price reduction from your initial offer ($1,900,000 to $1,700,000) signals that you are willing to negotiate, but you are also not desperate.
* **Encouraging Movement:** This counteroffer encourages Bob to make a more competitive offer if he is serious about purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for more in another round, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
