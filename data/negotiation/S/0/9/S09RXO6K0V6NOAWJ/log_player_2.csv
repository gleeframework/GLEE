"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  While $1,000,000 is your maximum, there's no guarantee Alice wouldn't accept a lower offer.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially saving some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if necessary. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still higher than my ideal.  I want to continue negotiating to see if I can push her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $800,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a better price than Alice's offer.  Since she has already lowered her price, I'm hoping she sees this as a reasonable compromise."
