"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you at $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
