"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you at $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering my budget."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer:

* **Starts significantly lower than Alice's offer:** This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Provides a reason for the lower offer:**  By mentioning my budget, I'm giving Alice context without revealing my absolute maximum price. 
* **Remains polite and optimistic:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still above our ideal price point and can likely negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By moving closer to Alice's price, we demonstrate that we're serious about making a deal.
* **Sets a firm target:**  Suggesting ""$750,000"" gives Alice a specific number to consider. 
* **Avoids revealing our absolute limit:** We still have some wiggle room below our $800,000 fallback option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll offer you a compromise: $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and we're now at a point where the potential savings from continued negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal. John's offer of $800,000 becomes the safer and more attractive option."
