"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $115 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $110. This is a good deal for Bob.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could potentially get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John for $120. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and it's likely that the final price will be closer to $110 anyway. 

Accepting Alice's offer at $110 is a good compromise that secures the product at a price within Bob's budget."
