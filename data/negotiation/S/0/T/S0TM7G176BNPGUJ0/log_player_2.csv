# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll be getting a valuable product at a lower price, and I'll still make a good profit. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
