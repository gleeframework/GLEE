Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think it's a great deal and will be valuable for you."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($150) than Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for potential negotiation or a counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While I want to maximize profit, asking for more than $150 is unreasonable since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (""a great deal,"" ""valuable"") might make the offer more appealing, even if subjective. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to adjust based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects, I might counter with a lower price (but no lower than $150 since John provides a safety net)."
