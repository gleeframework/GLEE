Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll assess Bob's reaction and adjust accordingly in the next rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still trying to get a better price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $900,000."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  $850,000 is closer to my minimum but I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try and squeeze out a bit more."

I'm meeting Bob halfway at his last offer. This demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached my minimum acceptable price with Bob. At this point, I don't want to risk going further and potentially losing the deal. John is a guaranteed sale at the minimum I'm willing to accept."
