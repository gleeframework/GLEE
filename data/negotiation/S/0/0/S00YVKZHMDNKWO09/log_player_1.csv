"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. I believe the product is a good one, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $10000. Can we meet in the middle at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to drop below $8,000 yet. I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This reflects a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still not sure it's the right price for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6000. Can we meet in the middle at $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000 at this point. I have a few rounds left, and I'm hopeful I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to offer you the product at $8,200. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 8200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6500. Can we meet in the middle at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time I'm going to sell to John. While I'd like to get more from Bob, his offers are getting closer to my minimum but not exceeding it.  I have a solid offer from John, and I want to ensure I at least break even.  I'm worried that if I keep going with Bob, I might end up with a lower price, and it's not worth the risk."
