"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  You are looking to pay no more than $800,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget considerations, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still outside your maximum budget of $800,000. You can still try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm committed to finding a fair deal, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's intrinsic value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to your ideal price point, it's still outside your budget. You have a few more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better deal. Continue to counteroffer and see if you can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $980,000, which reflects a considerable increase from my previous offer.  I truly believe this product holds value, but I'm operating within a defined budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 980000}
