"Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value, I'm setting the initial price at $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your budget considerations, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm committed to finding a fair deal, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's intrinsic value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $980,000, which reflects a considerable increase from my previous offer.  I truly believe this product holds value, but I'm operating within a defined budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
