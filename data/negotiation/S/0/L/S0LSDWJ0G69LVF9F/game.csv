"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  This is a great price for both of us, let's make it happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in my product.  While your offer of $920,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  To move forward, I need $935,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $910,000. Can we make it work?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to drop my price to $925,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's seal the deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",900000.0,Bob,8,
