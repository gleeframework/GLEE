Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth $175, but I'm willing to start with $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's worth a lot to you, Alice, and I am interested.  Could we meet halfway at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly what the product is worth to him. While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure a sale than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
