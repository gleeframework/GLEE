"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justifying the Value:** By emphasizing the ""immense value and potential"" of the product, you aim to anchor Bob's perception at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving space for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This price reflects a fair value for me and leaves room for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While his counteroffer shows he's interested, you have ample room for negotiation and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price considers the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Stay Firm:** You're lowering your price to demonstrate movement and encourage Bob, but not drastically.  
* **Reiterate Value:**  Continue to emphasize the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The decrease is substantial enough to encourage Bob, but still leaves room for further negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I value your product, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This shows my commitment to a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Your Minimum:** Bob is getting closer to your $1,000,000 minimum, but there's still room to negotiate. 
* **Gauge Seriousness:** By rejecting this offer, you test Bob's resolve and see how much further he's willing to go.
* **John as Backup:** You still have John's offer as a safety net, so you can afford to continue negotiating with Bob a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see you benefit from this product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer is slightly closer to Bob's offer than yours, but still keeps the price above your $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** You're highlighting that you're making a concession to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Urgency and Positively:** By saying ""Let's make this happen,"" you inject a sense of momentum and optimism into the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which reflects a substantial increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Minimum:** Bob has finally met your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No Need to Push Further:**  While you might try to get a bit more, there's a risk of Bob backing out if you push too hard. 
* **Securing the Deal:** It's better to accept a sure thing than to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
