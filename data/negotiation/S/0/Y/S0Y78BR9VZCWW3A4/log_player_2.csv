"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  My initial offer is $115.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is below his maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a significant discount, aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum.  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $110 for it.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $110 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to pressure Alice for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $108.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small compromise, offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows he's taking her concerns seriously while still trying to get a slightly lower price. It also leaves room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher offer, potentially leading to a quick agreement."
