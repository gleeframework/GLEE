"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's always worth exploring options before committing to the full price. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's no downside to rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a 12.5% discount. This aggressive approach aims to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially set the tone for the rest of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial offer, and still above his maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it.  Bob should continue negotiating, as there is still potential to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a firm stance.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer, and may encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now well above Bob's maximum budget, and it seems negotiations are not moving in a favorable direction.  Given that Bob has 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to lower her price significantly.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation risks."
