"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $900,000?  This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a reasonable return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given this careful consideration and I'd like to propose $875,000 as the price for your product. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring I'm not overpaying. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $887,500? This price allows me to make a decent profit while still being competitive for you.",887500.0,Alice,5,
