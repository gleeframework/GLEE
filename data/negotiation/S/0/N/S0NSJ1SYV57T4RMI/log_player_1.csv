"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Note:**  This is just the first round. I will continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining. If the negotiation stalls or I feel I won't get a good price, I'll switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still significantly lower than my ideal price. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, I have the opportunity to explore better options.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe I can push for a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John at $15,000 is always a safety net, but I want to maximize my earnings. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise that is more favorable to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750? This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Higher Price:**  $10,750 is still a good price for me, considering my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategic Thought:**

This counteroffer provides a reasonable compromise that could potentially incentivize Bob to accept, while still securing a better price than his initial offer. However, I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds depending on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While closer to my minimum, $9,750 is still significantly lower than my ideal price.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 7 rounds left, I have a decent amount of time to negotiate further.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There's still a gap between our desired prices, and I believe I can push for a higher price by counteroffering.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John at $15,000 is always a safety net, but I'm still motivated to try and get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,750. I'll keep in mind that the negotiation is getting tighter and might need to adjust my strategy if Bob continues to resist."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop the price to $10,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm lowering the price from my previous offer of $10,750 to $10,250, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and emphasizing how this price still represents a good deal.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message encourages Bob to see the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my ideal, while still being flexible. This round is crucial, as the negotiation is becoming more challenging.  If Bob rejects this offer again, I may have to reconsider my strategy and potentially make a bigger concession or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, $9,500 is still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 5 rounds left, I still have time to negotiate further.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my ideal of $10,250.  I'm aware that the negotiation is becoming more difficult, so I might need to adjust my strategy if Bob continues to resist. However, I'm determined to try and get a better deal with Bob if possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be cautious with your budget, but I'm also working within my own constraints.  I can offer you the product for $10,000. This is my final offer, as it's as low as I can go without impacting my own bottom line.  This is still a great price considering the value this product provides. Let's finalize this deal, as I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm communicating that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm lowering the price from $10,250 to $10,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. 
* **Focusing on Value and Finality:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the finality of my offer, hoping to push Bob towards acceptance.

**Strategy:**

I'm pushing for a price closer to my ideal while still acknowledging Bob's financial constraints. I'm hoping that the finality of my offer, combined with the value proposition, will convince Bob to accept. If he doesn't, I'll be prepared to accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, there's not much time for further negotiation.
* **Persistent Gap:** The gap between our desired prices continues to be significant. Bob's last offer of $9,250 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a much higher profit than I can realistically achieve with Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, it's become clear that we're too far apart in our desired prices. With the limited time remaining and John's guaranteed offer, it makes more sense to sell to him and secure a significant profit."
