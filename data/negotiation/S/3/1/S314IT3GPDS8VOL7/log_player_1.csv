{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to potentially reach a deal that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $8,800 is only slightly lower than my initial counteroffer and is closer to my desired price than selling to John. I'll accept Bob's offer."
