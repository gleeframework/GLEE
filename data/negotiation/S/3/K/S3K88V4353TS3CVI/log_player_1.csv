"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at a starting price of $2,200,000. This reflects the true worth and potential of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Demeanor:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer sets the stage for me to potentially move down in price, while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above my $1,500,000 minimum.

I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob, but I also have the security of John's offer. This allows me to be assertive in seeking a deal that truly benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. My counteroffer for the product is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my target and my fallback option with John. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide the price upwards.  Rejecting his offer now keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to counter with a more favorable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a substantial gap from where I see the value. This product has significant potential, and $1,900,000 reflects a fairer price considering its long-term benefits for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  I've decreased my asking price considerably, signaling some flexibility. However, the new price is still significantly above both his offer and my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential benefits to Bob's business, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that we can find a middle ground. My counteroffer for the product is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my guaranteed sale price with John. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the difference is no longer substantial enough to risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and a quicker close than continuing to negotiate."
