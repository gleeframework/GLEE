Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $11,500 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below $8,000.

By starting the negotiation with a strong but not unreasonable offer, you increase your chances of maximizing your profit with Bob while still having John as a backup option."
