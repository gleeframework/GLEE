"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Would you be willing to consider that?,135.0,Bob,4,
