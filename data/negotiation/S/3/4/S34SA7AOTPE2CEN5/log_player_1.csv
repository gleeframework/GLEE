{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 
 
This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product but below your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully motivates Bob to accept, while ensuring you still gain a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $12,500 is still too low for me. How about $13,000? That's a good compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,750.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll go back and forth for a while and I might not get a higher offer. John is already willing to pay my minimum, so it's more efficient and less time-consuming to just sell to him now."
