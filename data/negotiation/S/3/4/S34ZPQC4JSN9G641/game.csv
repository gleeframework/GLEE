"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing some progress.  To show I'm flexible, I can come down to $800,000, but that's my absolute floor.",800000.0,Alice,5,
