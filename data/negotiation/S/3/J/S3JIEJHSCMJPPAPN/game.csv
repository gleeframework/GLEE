"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good offer, I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110?  It's a fair price for a product that will bring you a lot of value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make some profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $112, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for a product that will bring you a lot of value.",112.0,Alice,5,
