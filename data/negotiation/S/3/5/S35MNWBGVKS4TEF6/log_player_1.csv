{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with my desired price of $15,000. This is my ideal outcome, but I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm being upfront and positive, acknowledging the value to Bob while emphasizing the great deal he's getting.  This sets a friendly tone and hopefully encourages him to consider my offer. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $12,000 on this product. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  I value the product at $15,000, and selling it for $12,000 would be a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is still on the table, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at his price.  

I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility, but not settling for his initial price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the $14,000 price as fair to both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly, encouraging further discussion and hopefully leading to a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll sell the product for $14,000.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $14,000. I would like to propose $13,000 as a compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is getting closer:** While $13,000 is still below my desired price, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer of $12,000.
* **Closing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of getting nothing. 
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is higher, it's not guaranteed. There's a chance that he could change his mind or find a better deal elsewhere.

Considering the risk vs. reward, accepting Bob's offer at $13,000 seems like the best option at this point. It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product and secure a decent profit."
