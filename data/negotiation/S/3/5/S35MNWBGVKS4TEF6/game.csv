"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, my budget allows me to spend no more than $12,000 on this product. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my budget?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $14,000. I would like to propose $13,000 as a compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
