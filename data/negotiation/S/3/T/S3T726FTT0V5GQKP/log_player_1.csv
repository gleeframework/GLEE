"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a good outcome.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His response will give me a better sense of his true valuation and how aggressively I can negotiate. 
* **John as Backup:**  It's good to keep in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John. This gives me leverage and the confidence to walk away if the deal with Bob isn't beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests he's very interested in the product. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming up, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This approach suggests compromise and fairness, which can be a good tactic in negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm still above my minimum and Bob's initial offer. This lets me see if he's willing to budge further before I consider going lower. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't revealed my absolute bottom line, keeping some negotiating power for later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $13,000 is a solid profit above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains. Bob is clearly anchored at $12,000, and it's unlikely I can push him much further.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away."
