"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than $140. Would you be willing to go down to $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would still be a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,4,
