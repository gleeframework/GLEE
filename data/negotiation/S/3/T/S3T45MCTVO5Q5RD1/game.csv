"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $100.  That's a fair price for both of us and avoids further negotiation.",100.0,Bob,4,
