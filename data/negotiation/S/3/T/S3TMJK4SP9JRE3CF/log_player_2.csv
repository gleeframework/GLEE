"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's too early to jump to John's offer at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $950,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should continue to negotiate, as he has room to bargain further and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $900,000.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is still too expensive at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $900,000. A counteroffer of $925,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing that Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $960,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $900,000 and it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks a stalemate, and John's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher. Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal and saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
