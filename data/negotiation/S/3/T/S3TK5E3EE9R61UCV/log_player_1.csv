This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and provides a strong incentive for Bob to accept. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000 and even lower than what I offered him initially. I'm willing to negotiate, but his offer is not a good starting point for that. I will counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $1000000.

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum value and what I offered him initially.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get closer to my target price. I will make a counteroffer to bridge the gap."
