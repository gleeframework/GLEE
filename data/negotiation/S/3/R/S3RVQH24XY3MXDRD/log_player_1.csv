``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still allowing me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm rejecting his offer and will proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still represents a significant profit for me. I believe this offer is fair to both parties and will likely lead to a successful negotiation."
