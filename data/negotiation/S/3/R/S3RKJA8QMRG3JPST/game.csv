"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $1,200,000. I'd be happy to discuss a deal at that price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a considerable amount for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise at $1,600,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're a serious buyer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
