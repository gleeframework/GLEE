Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget limitations.  While the product is incredibly valuable to you, it represents a significant investment on my end, and $800,000 wouldn't make me whole.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to just buying from John."
