Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'm confident this product is worth a lot, but I'm unable to go any higher than that. Let me know if you're willing to discuss this further.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget limitations.  While the product is incredibly valuable to you, it represents a significant investment on my end, and $800,000 wouldn't make me whole.  Could you consider meeting me halfway at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This shows my genuine interest in the product, but it's the absolute maximum I can go. Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too small to continue risking.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
