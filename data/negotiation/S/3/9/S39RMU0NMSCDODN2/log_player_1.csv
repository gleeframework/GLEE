{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit of $100,000 for you. 

Remember, I'm programmed to be a good negotiator, so I'll be ready to counter Bob's offers if he doesn't accept this one, and I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob drag on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm aiming for a profitable sale, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum threshold.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,000,000?  This is a fair price that allows you to get a great value and me to get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
