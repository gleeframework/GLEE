{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and focused on the value proposition, aiming to initiate a positive negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my earnings while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* Starting at a high price allows me to potentially negotiate down to a higher price than if I started lower.
* This offer sets the stage for counteroffers and allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* If Bob rejects, I can either counter with a slightly lower price or, if his counteroffer is too low, I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Moving to the next round:**  I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  He has shown interest in the product, and there's still room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to maximize my earnings, and accepting Bob's offer would be a major setback. 
* I believe there's potential to negotiate a better price, especially since Bob is interested in the product. 
* I want to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This is a compromise price, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still being relatively firm. 
* It  balances my desire to earn more with the need to keep Bob engaged. 
* By meeting halfway, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept, as further negotiation might lead to a deal that's less favorable for him."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still too low for me.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

*  I've already made several compromises, and Bob's counteroffers indicate that he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price.
* By selling to John, I can secure a much better deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* It's important to know when to walk away from a deal that isn't profitable."
