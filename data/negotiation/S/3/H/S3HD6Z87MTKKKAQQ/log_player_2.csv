# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a great deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your interest in acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than the first, it's still not a good deal for you. You are trying to save as much money as possible and $950,000 leaves you with less profit than buying from John.  It's worth pushing for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant amount over your valuation. Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
