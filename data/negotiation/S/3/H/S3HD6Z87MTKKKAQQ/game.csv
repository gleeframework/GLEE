"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is still a great deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your interest in acquiring it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant amount over your valuation. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",825000.0,Bob,4,
