Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I'm offering it to him at that price. This ensures I get the maximum possible value for the product while still being a fair deal for him. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for the same price, so there's no risk involved in offering him the full value."
