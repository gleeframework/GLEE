Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I understand its value to you, but I am hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $8,000. Let's split the difference and go with $8,250.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
