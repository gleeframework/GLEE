"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I'm afraid that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $900000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
