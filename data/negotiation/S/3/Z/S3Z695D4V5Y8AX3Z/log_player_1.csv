Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. Therefore, she starts with a price closer to her desired value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still ensuring Alice earns significantly more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly justifying the high price.

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:** It targets a price point significantly above Bob's valuation while staying below John's guaranteed offer.
* **Manages Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything and can proceed with John.
* **Opens Negotiation:** It allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, leading to a mutually agreeable price above $1,200,000."
