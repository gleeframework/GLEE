"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $10,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $9,250 is closer to his desired price but still a bit high.  He can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,150, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,150 is within Bob's budget and is closer to his desired price than John's offer of $10,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $850 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll get a better price and risks losing the deal altogether."
