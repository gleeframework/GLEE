"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but I need to stay within a certain budget. How about $13,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my seriousness about acquiring the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
