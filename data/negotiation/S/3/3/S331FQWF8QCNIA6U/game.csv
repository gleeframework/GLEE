"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the offer, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still only able to offer $100. I'm serious about wanting this product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already compromised a lot by coming down to 130. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",125.0,Alice,5,
