"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth $1000000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1100000.  I'd be happy to pay $950000 for it. This reflects the product's value to me, and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
