"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully leaves room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining my value for the product."
