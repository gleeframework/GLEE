Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While you could start higher, asking for something too close to $120 might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
