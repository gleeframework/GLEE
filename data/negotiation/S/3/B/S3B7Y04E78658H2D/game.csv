"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a huge asset to you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000 for the product. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $600,000 is quite a bit below market value for something of this quality. How about we settle closer to the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is of high quality, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $875,000, which would be $737,500. Can you consider this offer?",737500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that. To be fair to us both, let's try $810,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",810000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a slightly smaller offer. How about $785,000?",785000.0,Bob,6,
