Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product is of high quality, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $875,000, which would be $737,500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $737,500

We're still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a good deal, and I respect that. To be fair to us both, let's try $810,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to make a deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to make a slightly smaller offer. How about $785,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000

Bob is unlikely to reach my minimum at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer for a guaranteed $800,000."
