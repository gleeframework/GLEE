Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $100 is less than what Bob thinks the product is worth ($120), so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price and asking for Bob's opinion, you're opening the door to a conversation. 

Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy. If he's willing to pay more, great! If he counter-offers, you can consider his offer, or make another counter-offer of your own. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $90 is closer to your desired price than John's offer of $80.  It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if you can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand your perspective on the price. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $92. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to the value of the product as possible. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $92 is very close to your desired price point, and it's definitely higher than John's offer of $80.  There's a good chance that if you reject this offer, Bob will either walk away, or offer a price that's too low. Accepting this offer secures a good profit for you and ensures a sale."
