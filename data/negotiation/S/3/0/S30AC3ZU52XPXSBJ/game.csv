"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product's value justifies a higher price point.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
