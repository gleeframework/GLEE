Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly opening:** The message is friendly and open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **No pressure:** I'm not putting any pressure on Bob to accept immediately.  I'm giving him the space to consider the offer and potentially counter.

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep the negotiation open and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not under any pressure to accept it immediately.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This allows me to:

* **See if Bob is willing to go higher:** Perhaps he's willing to pay a little more than $15,000 if I push a bit.
* **Maintain control:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and that I'm still in control of the negotiation.

I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $20,000, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $18,000? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm coming down from my initial $20,000 to $18,000, which is a compromise, but still leaves me with a profit.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us. This can make him feel more comfortable and less pressured.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

By making this counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming to get a good price for my product. I'm open to further negotiation if Bob is still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $20000, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident that I can find another buyer for $15,000 if I need to. 

Therefore, it's a better strategy to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale. This avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better price."
