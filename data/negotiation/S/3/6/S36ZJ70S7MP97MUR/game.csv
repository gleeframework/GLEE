"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and allows me to make this purchase work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
