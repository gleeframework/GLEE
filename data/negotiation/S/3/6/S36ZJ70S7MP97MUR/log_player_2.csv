Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and allows me to make this purchase work."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 9

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We are in Round 9, with only one round left.**  This means the negotiation is almost over. 
* **Alice's final offer is $9,000, which is still above your target price of $12,000.** There's a strong chance that you won't be able to get a lower price in the final round.
* **John's offer of $12,000 is a guaranteed deal.**  While it's not your ideal price, it's a safe option that ensures you get the product within your budget.

Considering these factors, it's better to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice. It's wiser to secure the product now than to gamble on a potentially unsuccessful final round of negotiation."
