"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,250. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11,250 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $10,750.  This is a fair price that's good for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",11200.0,Alice,5,
