"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point given the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but need a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price reflects the true potential and worth of this product. To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price point represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your product has value, $1,400,000 is still significantly above what I'm able to pay. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. I believe this offer represents a significant step towards your number, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is as high as I can realistically go.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
