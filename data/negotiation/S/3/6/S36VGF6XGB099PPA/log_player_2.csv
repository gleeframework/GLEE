It's better to reject the offer and counteroffer Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $950,000."

At this point, it's a better deal to accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for $900,000, which is still within your budget and closer to your ideal price than John's offer of $800,000. There's a risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer again and potentially raising the price even higher, making John's offer the more appealing option. It's better to secure the product now while you have a good price."
