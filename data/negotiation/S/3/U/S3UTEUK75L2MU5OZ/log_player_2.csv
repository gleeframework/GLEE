"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."", ""product_price"": 60} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** My goal is to pay close to John's price ($80), but I'm willing to go a bit lower to see if I can get a better deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm leaving enough space between my offer and my maximum price to allow for counteroffers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think it's a bit pricey, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $100, though! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay and more than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about $75? That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 75}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  My offer of $75 is roughly halfway between her last offer ($100) and my previous offer ($60), signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Nearing the Alternative:** I'm getting closer to John's price ($80), so Alice needs to be more competitive if she wants to make the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice's offer of $90 is only slightly above my alternative option of buying from John for $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might save me a few dollars, but there's also the risk that Alice won't budge further, and I'll end up with John's offer anyway. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now saves me the time and effort of further negotiation. 

It's a good idea to take the deal at $90."
