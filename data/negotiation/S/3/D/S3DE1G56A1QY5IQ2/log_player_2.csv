"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really like. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. How does $100 sound? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, Alice's opening offer is still quite high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so rejecting her offer opens the door for potential negotiation or a lower counter-offer."
