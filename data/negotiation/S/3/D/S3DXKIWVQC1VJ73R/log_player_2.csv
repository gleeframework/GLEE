"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's significantly lower than your maximum budget, but you can likely get a better deal.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's a substantial difference between her minimum and your maximum.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go down to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and a good step closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your desired price.** It's only $50,000 more than your last offer, and still significantly lower than your maximum budget.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming.** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **The risk of losing the deal is increasing.**  If you reject Alice's offer again, she might become less willing to negotiate, or you might lose the opportunity altogether.
* **The potential savings are relatively small.**  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are minimal compared to the time and risk involved."
