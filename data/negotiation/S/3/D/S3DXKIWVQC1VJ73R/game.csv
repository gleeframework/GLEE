"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go down to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? It's still a great deal for you, and a good step closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
