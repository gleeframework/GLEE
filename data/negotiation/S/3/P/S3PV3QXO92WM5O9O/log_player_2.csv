"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $125 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also ensures a fair return for us. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $125. While this is a good deal, you can do better. You can get the product from John for $150, so rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially get a better price from someone else."
