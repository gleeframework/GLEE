"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product might bring substantial benefits, but I'm looking to acquire it within a more reasonable budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget considerations,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects both the product's value and my desire to see this deal through.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe that's a fair offer that recognizes the product's value while fitting within my budget constraints.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
