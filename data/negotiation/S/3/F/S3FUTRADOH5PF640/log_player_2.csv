"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, and $105 is a good starting point for his counteroffer. It's still above Alice's minimum value, so there's room for negotiation, but it also shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $112.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While Alice's offer is a slight concession, it's still above Bob's target of $105.  By rejecting, Bob keeps the negotiation open and signals that he is willing to walk away if he doesn't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit high at $112.50, but I'm willing to go to $108.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer.  $108 is still within his budget and represents a decent savings compared to Alice's latest offer. It's a reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $109.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his target price, but he still wants to see if he can get it even lower.  $109.50 is very close to his last offer of $108, and there's still potential to save a bit more. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a final price that's closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really want to get this deal done, but $109.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for his ideal price of $109, showing a willingness to close the deal. He's offered a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's offer. This signals a strong desire to close the deal while still maintaining his commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're eager to move forward, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $109. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and negotiations aren't going his way.  Alice is firm on her price, and while it's higher than Bob's target, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  By accepting, Bob secures the product at a reasonable price with a few rounds left to spare."
