"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. It's also still a good profit margin for me, as the product is worth $8,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a better price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a much better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a price that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm reducing my price slightly from $13,000 to $12,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that might convince Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a much better price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a price that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but at a slower rate.  $11,500 is still above Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate to close the deal at his price.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is still not at my desired price, I believe we are getting closer. I'm not ready to accept $9,000 yet, but I'm not ready to sell to John either. There is still potential to reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also aware that we only have 3 rounds left.  I believe this price is a good compromise that might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price, the risk of not reaching a deal with him is too high.  The offer from John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, making it the best option at this point."
