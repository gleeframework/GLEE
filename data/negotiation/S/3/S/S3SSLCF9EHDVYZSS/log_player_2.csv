{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for Alice to counter if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer.  While it's still below Bob's maximum budget, there's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation, aiming for a price closer to $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  $8,750 is a compromise that shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still keeping the price below his previous offer.  This gives Alice a chance to accept a price closer to her desired value."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still lower than Bob's maximum budget, it's higher than his previous counteroffer.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price closer to $8,750.  Rejecting this offer allows for continued negotiation, hoping to find a price both parties can agree on.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he feels the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price. Bob wants to see if Alice is willing to budge further, but he's also running out of rounds. This counteroffer is a compromise, raising the price slightly from the previous round, but still significantly lower than Alice's offer. This could be a point where Alice sees the value in accepting, as the negotiations are getting tighter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is creeping closer to Bob's maximum budget, and he's running out of time. With only three rounds left, the chance of getting a significantly lower price is shrinking. While $9,300 is a reasonable price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. Buying from John at $10,000 is still within his budget, and ensures he gets the product without risking further negotiation and potentially getting stuck at a higher price."
