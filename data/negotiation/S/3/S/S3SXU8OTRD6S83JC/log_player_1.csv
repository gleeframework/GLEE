Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to engage in further negotiation or simply accept John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell for $120 as it is significantly less than my minimum threshold of $150.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that is more acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a decent profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his initial offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not going to drop too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is slightly lower than John's offer of $150, but it is above my minimum threshold of $150. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob as it is a decent price and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
