{""product_price"": 12000}

Since the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, I'm starting with my asking price. This gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate, but also lets him know my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him than to John, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $11,000 is still a good deal for both of us.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise."

I'm coming down to $10,500, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm serious about negotiating with him, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is worth it for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer is at his maximum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum. I'll sell to John for $12,000."
