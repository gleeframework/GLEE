"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500.  What do you think?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $7,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet at $7,250? I'm willing to compromise a bit more to find a mutually beneficial price.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $7,250 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stick to a budget of $7,000. If you'd be willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really trying to stick to your budget, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. How about we meet at $7,100? I think that's as low as I can go.",7100.0,Alice,7,
