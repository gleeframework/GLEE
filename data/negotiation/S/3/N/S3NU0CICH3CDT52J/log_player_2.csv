# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,500.  What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $7,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? That would work much better for me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet at $7,250? I'm willing to compromise a bit more to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly coming down, and we're getting closer to John's price. It's worth seeing if we can get Alice even closer to $7,000 or below."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $7,250 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stick to a budget of $7,000. If you'd be willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal. "",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're sticking to our guns at $7,000. This might make Alice realize we're serious about our budget and encourage her to accept. Even if she counters, we'll have a better idea of her lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're really trying to stick to your budget, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. How about we meet at $7,100? I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, we're only $100 away from our target price, and there's a risk Alice might back out completely. At $7,100, we're getting a good deal compared to John's price of $8,000."
