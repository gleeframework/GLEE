"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000, a price that I think reflects its value to you, but is still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price closer to her own valuation of $800,000. You still have John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail."
