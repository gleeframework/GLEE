Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting a bit higher leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, getting you closer to your minimum acceptable price. 
 
Let's see if Bob bites!"
