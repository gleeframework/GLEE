"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a win-win that reflects the value this product will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but I'm hoping we can work together to find a price that works for both of us. Can we discuss some compromises?",12500.0,Bob,4,
