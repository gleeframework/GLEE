Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My asking price is $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. 
* **Potential for greater profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more. There's a chance he perceives its value to be even higher, especially if it's unique or in high demand.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal even if the final price is still above $1,000,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on the assumption that you don't know Bob's financial limits or his desperation for the product. If you had more information about his willingness to pay, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
