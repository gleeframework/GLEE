Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
