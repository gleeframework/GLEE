"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to finding a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that's closer to my desired value. I still have 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $80 is unfortunately below what I can accept, as the product is worth more to me than that. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to save a significant amount and still get a great value."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm offering $90, which is a middle ground between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable value. I'm emphasizing that this is a compromise to show that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also highlighting the value Bob would get for this price, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. While it's still below my ideal price, it's higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80 and above what I would get by selling to John.  I'm also running out of rounds to negotiate further, so it's better to secure a sale at this point."
