"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, to be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $775,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, the product is valuable.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, to $800,000.  That's a very competitive offer and reflects the value it holds for me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
