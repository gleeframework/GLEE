"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm looking to sell a valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true worth. I'm thinking of starting at $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it gives me some room to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and is closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial price. However, $11,250 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $11,500. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,
