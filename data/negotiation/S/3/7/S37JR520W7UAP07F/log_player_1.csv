Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum threshold, but it's clear he's not going to budge significantly. I have 2 rounds left, and it's unlikely I can get a better deal. John is offering my minimum price, and that's a much more secure and guaranteed outcome for me."
