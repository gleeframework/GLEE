Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get more for the product. I'm confident in the value of my product and I'm willing to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm also recognizing that Bob may not be willing to pay more than $80. I believe this is a fair offer that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $85. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer and closer to my initial asking price. I'm satisfied with this outcome as it allows me to sell the product and still earn a decent profit."
