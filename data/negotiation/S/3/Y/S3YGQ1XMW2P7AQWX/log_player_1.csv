"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, given its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing it as a ""fantastic deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for 5 rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John.  

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we'll continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and allow us to close quickly. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,050,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** I still have 8 rounds left and want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can convince Bob to pay closer to my initial asking price with further negotiations.

Let's continue the negotiation and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement!"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, suggesting this price is still a good deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I'm encouraging Bob to consider my offer as a reasonable solution. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal to avoid the risk of selling to John.

Let me know Bob's response to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1075000. This is a fair compromise that allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's close this quickly.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Time is running out:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, and while selling to John is always an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise and is clearly interested in the product.  I believe with further negotiation, I can get him to agree on a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum.
