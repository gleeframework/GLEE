"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that's worth a significant amount to me.  I understand it holds value for you as well.  While my minimum asking price is $1,200,000, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a substantial discount from my minimum, reflecting the value I see in a potential partnership with you.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm happy to consider Alice's offer. However, I'm not sure if $1,000,000 is a good deal for me. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, which is a much better price. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
