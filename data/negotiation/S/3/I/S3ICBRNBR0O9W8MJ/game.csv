"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to counter with an offer of $110 for the product. This still reflects a premium price given its value to you, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
