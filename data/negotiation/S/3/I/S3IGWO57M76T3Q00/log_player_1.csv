"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. I want to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware of the potential for John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is getting very close to my minimum, but I still think I can get a slightly better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation seems to be stalled. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
