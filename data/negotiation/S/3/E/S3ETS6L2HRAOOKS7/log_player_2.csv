"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always go to John if you can't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value ($800,000).
* **Negotiation room:** This leaves room for potential negotiation, as both Alice and I have some flexibility. 
* **Balanced approach:** This offer shows that I am serious about buying the product while also demonstrating that I am willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price.**  While I would prefer to pay less, $1,100,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might increase the price again, or I might not be able to reach a better price.
* **Avoiding the fallback:**  I want to avoid buying from John as his price is significantly higher."
