"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer of $18,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
