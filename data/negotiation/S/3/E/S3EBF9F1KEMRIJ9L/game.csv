,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, though.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my means.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
