"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and offer it to you at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. I value this product highly, and while I want to find a solution, I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?  This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping you'll recognize the value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a fair deal. ",9500.0,Bob,6,
