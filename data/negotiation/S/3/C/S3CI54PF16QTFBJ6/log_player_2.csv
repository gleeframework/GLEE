"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and find a better deal. This might prompt Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If not, you can always purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your absolute ceiling."
