Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  This reflects the product's worth to me, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value to me is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $750000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
