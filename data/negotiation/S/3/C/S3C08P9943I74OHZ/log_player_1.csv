"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, but I'm leaving room to negotiate.  $175 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for me to potentially reach a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will counter with a price closer to $150, which I can then accept or negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $120. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $120 is significantly below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm sorry, but I still can't meet you at $150. My maximum is $130. I hope we can find a way to work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and closer to my minimum.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to pay $135 for your product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with this price, I will be selling to John. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 140}
