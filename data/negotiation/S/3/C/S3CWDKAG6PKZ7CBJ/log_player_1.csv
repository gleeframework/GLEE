Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming for a price slightly below that maximizes potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from trying to lowball the offer.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John provides a strong fallback position, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
