"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $15,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you, even exceeding its price tag. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $13,000 is still a little too steep for my budget. How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
