,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and our continued negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000.  This product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm confident that at this price, it will be a profitable investment for your business.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to go over that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. I'll offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and the price John is offering.",975000.0,Bob,6,
