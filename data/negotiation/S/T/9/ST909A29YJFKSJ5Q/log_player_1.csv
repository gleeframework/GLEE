Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're looking for, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  $950,000 is still below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not able to go lower than $1,000,000.  This product is truly unique and holds significant value.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to go over that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. I'll offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm getting and the price John is offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm still hoping for a better price, the negotiation with Bob seems to be stalling, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
