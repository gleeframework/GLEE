Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000.
