"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,7,
