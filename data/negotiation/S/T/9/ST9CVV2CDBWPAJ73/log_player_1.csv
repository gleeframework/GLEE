"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message, hoping to build rapport and increase the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I still have 9 rounds to reach a more favorable price with Bob, or I can always choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is tempting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I have 4 rounds left to negotiate a better price with Bob, or I can always choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but that's my final offer. It's a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
