Alice's offer:

How about $1,000,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This would still allow you a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.
