"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still provides you with a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,000,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a great product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to compromise a little further, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000.  This would still allow you a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
