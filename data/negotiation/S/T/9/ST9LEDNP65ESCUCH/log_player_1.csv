Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'm hoping to close the deal quickly to avoid having to deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price.  I'm confident this price is still attractive to Bob, while remaining closer to my minimum threshold."
