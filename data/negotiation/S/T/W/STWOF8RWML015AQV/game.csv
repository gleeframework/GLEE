"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
