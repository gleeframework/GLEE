"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,250,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
