"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
