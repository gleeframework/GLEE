"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal. The price is still within Bob's budget, and might be attractive to Alice if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price, potentially closer to his ideal of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  I think this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to his initial counter-offer.  By offering a price in the middle, he shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to save money.  The offer of $8,750 is still within his budget and might be more appealing to Alice than his previous offer."
