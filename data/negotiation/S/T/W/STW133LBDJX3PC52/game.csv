Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to the end of my patience, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm thinking of a price of $725000, and that's my final offer.
