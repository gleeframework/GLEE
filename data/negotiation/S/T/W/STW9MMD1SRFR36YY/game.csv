"I appreciate your confidence in your product's value, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also acknowledging your budgetary limitations. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'd like to offer $1,450,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
