Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by offering the product at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $115, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but value the product highly.
* **Considering the Alternative:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum price ($100) than it is to his perceived value ($120). There's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $112?"", 
""product_price"": 112
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($110). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** $112 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not dropping my price too drastically too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $111? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, the difference between $111 and a potential $112 is minimal.  
* **Securing the Sale:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away if I continue to negotiate. Accepting $111 ensures a good profit and avoids the possibility of losing the sale entirely. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  Remember, I have a guaranteed offer from John at $100. Accepting $111 from Bob is a much better outcome."
