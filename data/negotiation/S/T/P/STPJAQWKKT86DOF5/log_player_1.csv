Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest without revealing your bottom line. The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" subtly implies there are other potential buyers.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and interest"" in the product attempts to justify the high price, even if Bob doesn't perceive the same value.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially settling around $17,000-$18,000 and still making a significant gain.
* **Bob rejects:**  You move on to John and secure your minimum desired price of $15,000."
