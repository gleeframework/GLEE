I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  It's also a price that might pique his interest without being immediately rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'll reject his offer and try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable price for Bob.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I don't want to risk Bob continuing to lowball me.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a solid profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
