"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $100?  That seems like a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. Can you consider that?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to split the difference, how about $97.50? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. Can you meet me there?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. How about we split the difference again and settle on $95? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $95 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,8,
