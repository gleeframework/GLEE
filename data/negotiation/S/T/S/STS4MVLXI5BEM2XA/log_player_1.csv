"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm setting a psychological anchor. Even though Bob might not pay $2,000,000, it frames the subsequent offers in a different light. He might be more receptive to a lower offer (but still above his valuation) after seeing the initial high price. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a solid backup plan with John, who's willing to pay my minimum. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. It's a significant jump from his initial valuation, indicating a willingness to compromise. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents the high-end value for this product, I understand your constraints. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession of $350,000 to demonstrate flexibility and signal my willingness to make a deal. 
* **Midpoint Target:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point slightly above the midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous ask. It leaves room for further negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds left, I'm applying slight pressure to encourage Bob to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches my absolute lowest acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Stronger Position:** While I could push for a slightly higher amount, Bob has consistently moved upwards in his offers, indicating a strong desire for the product.  
* **Time and Risk:**  Accepting now eliminates the risk of further negotiation and secures a  sale at my desired price point. Prolonging the negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a worse offer."
