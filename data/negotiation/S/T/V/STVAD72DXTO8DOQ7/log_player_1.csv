Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for the product.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $10,000. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially come to a mutually acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go with John and get my minimum price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's Value:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to come down from my previous offer of $14,000 to $13,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeping My Minimum in Sight:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Pressuring Bob:** This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob. If he rejects this, he might be risking losing the deal altogether, as I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still $3,000 below it. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob further away from a deal, and I might not be able to achieve my minimum price.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum price and removes any further risk.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiations could take time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome."
