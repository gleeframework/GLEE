""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I've set the price at $1,190,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering its potential worth. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit While Ensuring a Deal:** Alice wants to maximize her profit but also needs to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, anything less than that is profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,190,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gets the product for $190,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000) and saves $10,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, the slightly lower price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive, allowing Alice to potentially earn even more."
