This offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit, providing you with a fantastic deal and allowing me to maximize the value of my product. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than your maximum budget and John's price, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing Alice to lower her price further."
