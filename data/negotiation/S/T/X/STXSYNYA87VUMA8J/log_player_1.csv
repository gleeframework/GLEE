Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm asking for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $20,000, I'm anchoring Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to $20,000 than $15,000.
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This allows me to be firmer in my pricing. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes I have some information about Bob and believe he might be willing to pay above $15,000. If I knew Bob was very price-sensitive, I might adjust my strategy."
