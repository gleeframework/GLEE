"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16000?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $13500 is simply not going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $14250? It's a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's make this deal happen!",14250.0,Alice,5,
