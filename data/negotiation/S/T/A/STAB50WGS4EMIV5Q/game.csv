"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $600,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best price for now.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering your original asking price and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer for now.",800000.0,Alice,5,
