"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a high price.  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so this offer is still attractive to him. It leaves room for negotiation, but it also ensures I get a good starting point. 

I'm leaving myself some wiggle room in case Bob doesn't accept this first offer. I can still go down to $1,000,000 if needed, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway.  It's still a decent profit for me, and it shows good faith that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,280,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too far below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round. I still have some room to negotiate without risking selling to John for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again meeting Bob halfway, this time offering $1,320,000. This is closer to his offer, showing that I'm serious about a deal, but still above my minimum. With only 5 rounds left, I'm trying to find a compromise that will secure the deal without forcing me to accept a low offer or risk selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,270,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  There's only 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful. However, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate. I have the advantage in this situation because Bob clearly values the product more than $1,270,000 and I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John if needed. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a more significant concession, showing my willingness to reach an agreement. With only three rounds left, I need to be flexible but still try to secure a price that's closer to my desired outcome. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  If he rejects it, I'll likely have to make a decision about selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob is not willing to budge from his price. I am concerned that the next round will result in a counteroffer even lower than $1,250,000.  I am unwilling to accept a price so low. I have held out for as long as I could but, it's time to cut my losses.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum amount, guaranteeing a profit. It's better to secure $1,000,000 than risk a lower offer or potentially no deal at all."
