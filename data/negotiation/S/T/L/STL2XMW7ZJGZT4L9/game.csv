"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
