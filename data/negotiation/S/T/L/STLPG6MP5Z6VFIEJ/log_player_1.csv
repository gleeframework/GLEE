Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** The $10,000 offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still space to negotiate downwards, closer to his perceived value of $8,000. 
 
This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a chance to purchase a product he values."
