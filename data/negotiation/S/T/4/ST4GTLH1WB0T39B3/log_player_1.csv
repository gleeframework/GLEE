Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, a price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to counter-offer. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* This assumes I don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If I had more information about his financial limitations or how badly he needs the product, I could adjust my offer accordingly. 
* Time sensitivity isn't factored in. If a quick sale is essential, I might lower the price to ensure Bob's acceptance."
