Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1000000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1750000. This reflects a substantial price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely you'll get Alice to come down to a price you're comfortable with."
