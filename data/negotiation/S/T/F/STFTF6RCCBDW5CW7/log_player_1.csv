"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to come close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 at this time. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value.  I still have 8 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This gives you a great deal and me a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm going to try to squeeze out a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still firm on $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal. Let's close this now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge on his $13,000 offer.  While this is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm running out of rounds (only 4 left), and John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000.  It's more beneficial to sell to John and ensure I reach my minimum target price."
