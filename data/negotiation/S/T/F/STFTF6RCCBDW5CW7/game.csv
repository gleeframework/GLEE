"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000 at this time. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This gives you a great deal and me a fair price. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're open to it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still firm on $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal. Let's close this now.",13000.0,Bob,6,
