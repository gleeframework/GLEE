"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
