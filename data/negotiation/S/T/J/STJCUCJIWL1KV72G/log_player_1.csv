"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get a good deal. It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $100, so I'm not afraid to be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm trying to split the difference and show some flexibility. I'm confident that $135 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $135, Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 away. I'm realizing that it's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and possibly losing the sale."
