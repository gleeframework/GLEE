"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This move is a gamble, but it signals Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffers in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($1,200,000) but still lower than Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000).  Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a lower price.  While the time is ticking, there are still several rounds left to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a more moderate counteroffer, aiming to meet Alice's value for the product. This signals Bob's willingness to compromise and suggests a potential deal could be close. If Alice rejects, Bob will have to reconsider his strategy and potentially increase his offer further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price. However, it's still higher than Alice's own value for the product.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal, especially since he still has several rounds remaining. If he accepts, he'll save $100,000 compared to buying from John, but he could still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $1,250,000, which is still lower than Alice's current offer but higher than Alice's value for the product.  This move shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price. If Alice rejects, Bob might need to consider raising his offer further in the next round, but he still has time to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. Although the time is running out, Bob should continue to negotiate, especially since he still has several rounds remaining. There's still potential for Alice to lower her price further.  If he accepts now, he'll only save $50,000 compared to buying from John. The potential for a better deal is worth continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a more aggressive counteroffer in this round, aiming to find a middle ground with Alice's last offer.  He is now proposing a price that is higher than his previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. With only three rounds left, Bob needs to signal his willingness to make a deal while still trying to get a price closer to his desired amount. This move could push Alice to accept or lead to further negotiations in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in Round 9 is equal to Bob's maximum budget and also the price John is offering.  There's no advantage to continuing negotiations with Alice.  This is a stalemate, and Bob is better off buying the product from John, as he's guaranteed to secure it at his maximum price.  By accepting Alice's offer, Bob wouldn't be saving any money."
