"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $800,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident this product is worth $900,000 to me.  This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree.",900000.0,Bob,4,
