"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is still above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $800,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still above his budget. He should try to get closer to his goal of $800,000 by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident this product is worth $900,000 to me.  This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to the original price of $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still too high. He's already stated his final offer of $900,000, and there's a chance Alice might counter with a better offer to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to make this deal work, but I can't go any higher.  It's a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. 

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  He's already stated his willingness to pay $950,000, and Alice has rejected that offer.   It's unlikely Alice will come down to $900,000, and Bob has 3 rounds left.  This means he's risking missing out on a great deal from John by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
