"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $12,000 is above your budget, and you can always buy from John for $10,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget.  Hopefully, Alice sees the value in getting a deal done quickly and accepts this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than John's price. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This is a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see that it's a fair price considering she rejected my previous offer. We're getting closer to finding a middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement before needing to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than John's price. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm offering $9,750.  We're very close now, and this feels like a fair price that's closer to Alice's last offer while still being within my budget."
