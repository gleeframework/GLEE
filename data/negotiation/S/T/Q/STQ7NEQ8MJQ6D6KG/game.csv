"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's the maximum I can offer. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
