Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring you get a decent profit.  

Remember, you have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000. This gives you a strong bargaining position!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to your minimum, you can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations. Rejecting his offer allows you to send a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's the maximum I can offer. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than your last offer of $9,500. While you could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit. It's always a good idea to weigh the potential for higher gains against the risks of continued negotiation and potential delays."
