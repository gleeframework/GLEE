"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe would be of great interest to you. Given its potential value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefit you stand to gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price. You always have the fallback option of buying from John for $1,200,000."
