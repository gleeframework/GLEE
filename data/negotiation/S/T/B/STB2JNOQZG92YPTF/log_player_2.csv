"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your asking price and still a profitable transaction for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $1,350,000?  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for profit on your end.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I need to keep negotiating to try and get a price closer to my target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
