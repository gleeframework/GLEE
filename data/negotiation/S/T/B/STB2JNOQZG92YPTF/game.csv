"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your asking price and still a profitable transaction for you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about $1,350,000?  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for profit on your end.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
