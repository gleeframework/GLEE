"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $120. Considering its quality and benefits, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at the maximum you're willing to pay.** There's no benefit to accepting her offer as you can get the same product from John for the same price.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows for potential negotiation.** You can potentially get a better price from Alice if she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is a guaranteed option.**  It's a safe fallback if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
