I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair starting point given that I don't know Bob's value for the product.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I don't want to risk another round of counteroffers and potentially lose more time and energy.  Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and a quick transaction."
