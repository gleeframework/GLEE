Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and this offer reflects my desire for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) is crucial to maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a substantial profit margin for Alice ($100,000 above John's offer) while still leaving room for Bob to perceive value (saving $100,000 on his perceived worth).
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message emphasizes a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and increasing the chance of acceptance."
