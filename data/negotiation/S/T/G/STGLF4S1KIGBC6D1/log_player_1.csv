Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so this leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's easy for Bob to understand your offer.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also encouraging Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a higher final price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, you can likely do better than that. Bob clearly values the product and has already indicated he's willing to pay more than your minimum.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a price closer to your desired $100 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $95?  It's still a great price for a product worth much more to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not settle for a price significantly lower than your initial offer.
* **Compromise:**  The $95 price is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and your previous offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit of paying a slightly higher price."
