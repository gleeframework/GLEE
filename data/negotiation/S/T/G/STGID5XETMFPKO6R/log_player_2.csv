"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price.  You have 9 rounds left, so there's time to make counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me.  I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for further negotiation.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially considering I have 8 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating, as I still have several rounds left. There's a good chance I can get her to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm keeping a close eye on John's offer, as it's a safety net if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my maximum budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that I am ready to purchase right now."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is exactly at my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will accept it, as it's a fair price for her considering she values the product at $1,500,000.  If she rejects it, I'm ready to buy from John immediately, as we're at a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. Even though I have 5 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee I can get her to lower the price further.  John's offer is my safety net, and it's the best price I can get without going over my budget.  I'm willing to cut my losses and buy from John to ensure I secure the product."
