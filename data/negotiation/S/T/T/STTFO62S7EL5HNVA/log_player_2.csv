"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $6,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to my target price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time while clearly stating my price expectations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, especially since I have the option to buy from John at the same price. Accepting now secures the product for me."
