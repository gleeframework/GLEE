"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, you can still potentially do better. It's worth attempting a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to her.  It leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my target price of $8,000.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her closer to my price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $8,750.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer but still a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. If this offer is rejected, I'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, she's still $900 above my target of $8,000. I've already made two counteroffers and she's only reduced the price by $100 each time. This suggests she might be unwilling to come down to my desired price.  It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John at $8,000."
