"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This way, we can both feel good about the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $11,500 is pushing my budget.  I can do $10,500, but that's really as high as I can go. If we can't agree on that, I may have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum of $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? It's a bit more than $10,500, but I'm willing to do it to get a deal done.",12250.0,Alice,7,
