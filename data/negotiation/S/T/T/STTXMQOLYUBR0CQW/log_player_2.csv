"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better price."

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her valuation.  We'll try to nudge her down further, but we need to be mindful of John's price as a backup."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

Alice is barely budging now, and we're getting closer to John's price. One more counter-offer is worth the risk, but we need to signal we're nearing our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $11,500 is pushing my budget.  I can do $10,500, but that's really as high as I can go. If we can't agree on that, I may have to explore other options."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get as close as possible to my minimum of $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? It's a bit more than $10,500, but I'm willing to do it to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

It's clear Alice is not going to budge significantly from her last offer. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a price significantly better than John's $15,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
