"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  This offer is a good compromise, reflecting the product's value while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
