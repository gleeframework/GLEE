"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer potential:** You have a significant margin to work with ($1,500,000 - $800,000).  A counteroffer gives you the chance to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While it's a step closer to your ideal price, it's still above the product's true worth to Alice.
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still a considerable difference between Alice's offer ($1,200,000) and your maximum price ($1,500,000).  A counteroffer might get you a better deal."
