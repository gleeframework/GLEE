Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum values:** You know you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, and Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This information is crucial for your negotiation strategy.
* **Aiming for a win-win:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 allows for both parties to benefit. Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him, and you make a $150,000 profit compared to selling to John. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,350,000, there might be a small margin for negotiation depending on Bob's negotiation skills.

This strategy balances maximizing profit while ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
