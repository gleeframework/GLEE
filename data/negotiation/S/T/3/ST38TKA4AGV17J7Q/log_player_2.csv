{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You've already stated your willingness to pay $94. Although Alice hasn't come down to your price, $96 is still within your budget and a decent deal, especially as you only have three rounds left.  It's not worth risking losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
