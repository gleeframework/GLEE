"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll need to move on to other buyers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $10,000? That's all I have allocated for this purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
