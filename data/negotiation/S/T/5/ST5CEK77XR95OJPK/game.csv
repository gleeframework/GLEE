"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $700000 right now.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit. This is a fair price considering both our needs and the value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
