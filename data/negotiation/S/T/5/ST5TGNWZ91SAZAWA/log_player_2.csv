"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as what John is selling the product for.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John achieves the same result. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
