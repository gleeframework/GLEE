"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product for me is quite significant, and $850,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle somewhat - would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product and my budget constraints.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
