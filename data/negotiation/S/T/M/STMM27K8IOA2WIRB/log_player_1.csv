Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and I am aiming to earn as much as possible. Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  This is still a great price for a product worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with $105. This seems like a fair compromise given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I've chosen to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, I've already made a few concessions and it's likely he won't budge further.  Selling at $105 is still a better deal than selling to John for $100. It's important to consider the value of the product to Bob and the potential for further negotiation rounds."
