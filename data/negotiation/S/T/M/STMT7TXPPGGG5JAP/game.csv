"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a discounted price of $1,400,000. This represents a significant savings for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to make a commitment.  While I understand your budget, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to accept. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,350,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you a great deal and me a fair price. Let's try to come to an agreement here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,300,000?
