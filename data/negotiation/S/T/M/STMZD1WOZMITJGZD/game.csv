"Alice, $18000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still outside my price range. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14000, but I can't go any higher. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $15500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
