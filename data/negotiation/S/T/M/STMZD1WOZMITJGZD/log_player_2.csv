"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price of $18000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside my price range. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $14,000, but I can't go any higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $15500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a real risk that he could end up spending more than he's comfortable with or that the deal won't get done at all.  John offers a guaranteed deal within his price range, so it's the safest and most sensible option."
