"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I've assessed its worth and believe a fair price would be $1450000. This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I receive a reasonable return on my investment.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and lower than the price John is asking ($1,500,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate further to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your perspective, $1350000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1400000 for the product. This offers you a strong value and allows me to maintain a reasonable profit.  Let's find common ground here.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000. While this is getting closer to my ideal price, I can still try to negotiate further. There's room to lower the price even more without losing too much."
