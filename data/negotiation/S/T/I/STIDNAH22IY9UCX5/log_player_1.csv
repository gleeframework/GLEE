"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation, implying I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response and will be prepared to adjust my offer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  
* **Negotiation Room:**  While Bob's offer shows interest, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer that's still within a reasonable range. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll also need to factor in the remaining rounds and my risk tolerance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This gives us both a good deal, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price significantly from the initial offer but staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that my counteroffer benefits both of us. 
* **Strong Closing:** I'm using a closing statement to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my next move: lowering the price slightly or going to John with a $1,000,000 deal.  The remaining rounds will be critical in determining my next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at $950,000. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this is a price we can agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm ideally aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob has shown he's willing to compromise, and there's still some room to negotiate a slightly higher price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John at $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed deal, but I'm hesitant to give up on potentially getting closer to my target price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price slightly higher than $950,000, perhaps $975,000. I'll need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and how much I'm willing to lower my price to secure a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and $950,000 is a good offer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a small adjustment, but it reflects the product's unique value.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Closing Statement:** I'm using a confident closing statement to push Bob towards acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John. I'll consider the remaining rounds and my risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $975,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $900,000. It's a solid offer for both of us, and we're getting very close to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing.
* **Significant Gap:**  There's still a sizable gap between Bob's offer ($900,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price that I'm not comfortable with.

**Next Steps:**

Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me a good return. It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
