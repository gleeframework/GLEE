Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $925,000. I believe it offers exceptional value and would be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price of $925,000 positions the product significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), while still aiming for a substantial profit above your minimum ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.  
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, you can walk away knowing you have a solid alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. It's strategically advantageous to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm confident it can make a substantial impact on your business. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm but Fair:**  While rejecting Bob's low offer, we don't want to appear unreasonable and risk derailing the negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Strategic Midpoint:**  $875,000 represents a midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It signals a willingness to negotiate but emphasizes your position that the product is worth more than his initial bid.
* **Value Emphasis:** Reminding Bob of the product's potential value to his business reinforces why paying a higher price is justified.
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly mentioned, the presence of John's standing offer at $800,000 provides an underlying strength to your position. You're willing to walk away if a fair deal isn't reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to increase my offer. Would it be possible for us to negotiate at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has now reached your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you might have been able to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if you push further. 

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Accepting this offer ensures you achieve your goal of selling the product for no less than $800,000.
* **Avoiding Further Risk:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to Bob lowering his offer or walking away entirely, at which point you'd be left with John's offer, equivalent to what you have now.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now also has value.  Delaying the sale means delaying your receipt of the money, which could have other implications for your business or investment opportunities."
