Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($100) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $95 gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly tone will make Bob feel valued and more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $95, as that's still within Bob's perceived value and allows me to make more than selling to John.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that $85 is not an acceptable price.  This opens the door for further negotiation. 
* **Counter-Offer Potential:**  A counter-offer gives me a chance to adjust the price and potentially find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Empathy and Justification:**  Acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and highlighting the value of the product makes the counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation positive and avoids creating tension."
