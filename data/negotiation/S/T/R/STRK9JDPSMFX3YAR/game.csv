"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is firmly rooted in its unique features and potential, which justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
