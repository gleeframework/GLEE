Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1400000. Considering the value and rarity of the product, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1800000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
