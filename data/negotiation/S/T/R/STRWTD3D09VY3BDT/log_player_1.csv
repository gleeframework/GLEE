Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. Remember, any price above $80 is a profit for you."
