"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, for a price that I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's find a mutually beneficial price.  Consider this: you'll be acquiring a product worth $1,000,000 to you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to proceed with John's offer, which fits within his financial limit."
