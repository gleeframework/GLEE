"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
