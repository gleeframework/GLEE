"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point that reflects a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a positive outcome for both parties.  It's a significant discount from Bob's estimated value, giving him room to negotiate, while still offering me a substantial return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it still falls short of my desired profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying within my desired profit range.  I'm demonstrating flexibility while also signaling my belief in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired profit. With only six rounds remaining, I'm risking losing too much time by continuing to negotiate, potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for less."
