Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  It's a steal for its value! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you're still making a profit. 
* **It's a clear message:** The message is friendly and sets the stage for a potential negotiation. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum price, meaning you will still make a profit.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation.  Accepting his offer guarantees you the desired outcome."
