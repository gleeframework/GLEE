"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to potentially get a better price. There are still 9 rounds to go, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a reasonable strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  I'm confident this will still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm eager to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer.  I will continue to negotiate and try to lower the price further.  There are still 7 rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I acknowledge the value of this product, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the current market conditions. I hope you'll find this offer agreeable and we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000.  This keeps the deal beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $1,000,000, and we're nearing the halfway point in our negotiations. While there's a chance Alice might budge further, it's risky to continue with only 5 rounds left. Buying from John guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
