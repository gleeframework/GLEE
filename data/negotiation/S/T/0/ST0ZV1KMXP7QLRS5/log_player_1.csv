"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counter with a price slightly above $1,400,000."

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so it's the safest option."
