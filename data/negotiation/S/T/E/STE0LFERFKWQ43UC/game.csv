"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make sure this product is right for you.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $140.  It's a fair price considering its value.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. Could you do $80?  That would be a price I could work with.",80.0,Bob,4,
