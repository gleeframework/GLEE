Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but that's still quite a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to meet me closer to that number?

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
