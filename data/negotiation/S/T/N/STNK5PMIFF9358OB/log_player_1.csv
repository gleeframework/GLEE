Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if he negotiates, you're still likely to end up with a price higher than $15,000.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to be polite but firm on the product's value. This allows you to see how interested Bob truly is. If he's put off by the price, you can always negotiate or move on to John. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, given you have a backup buyer, it's a calculated risk worth taking to potentially maximize your profit."
