"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1050000. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $975000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1050000, and if you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $987500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",987500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on price, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer. I'm giving you one last chance to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
