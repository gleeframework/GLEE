"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. This also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for my minimum price just yet. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value.  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Let me see if I can meet you halfway. How about $102 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  It's only slightly below my minimum, but it's a good deal considering the limited rounds and the risk of losing the sale to John.  It's important to balance getting the best price with the possibility of losing the deal entirely."
