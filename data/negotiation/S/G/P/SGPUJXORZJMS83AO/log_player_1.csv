Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I propose a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price significantly higher than your fallback option. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high asking price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell quickly, a less aggressive approach might be wiser."
