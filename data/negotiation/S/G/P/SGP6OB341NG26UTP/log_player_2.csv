"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum desired price of $1,500,000. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better price.  I have plenty of rounds left to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Let's start with that figure and see where we can go from there."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a strong compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit high on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? I'm confident we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still within my budget and closer to my target price.  I've gone through several rounds, and it's becoming clear that we're nearing a compromise.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement before my 10 rounds are up.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
