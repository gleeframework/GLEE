"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. Let's start with that figure and see where we can go from there.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a strong compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit high on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'll counteroffer at $1,075,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
