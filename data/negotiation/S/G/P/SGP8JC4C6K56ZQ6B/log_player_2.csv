Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your valuation of our product. After considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $600000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad we're narrowing the gap. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $625000. This price offers a middle ground between our previous offers, allowing us to reach a fair agreement. I hope this suggestion works for you, and I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $625,000 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and closer to your last counteroffer. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise.  It's likely you won't get a significantly better deal by continuing to negotiate, and you could end up paying more by buying from John."
