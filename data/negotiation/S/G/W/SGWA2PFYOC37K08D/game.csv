"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $140 is still a little out of my price range.  How about $135?  That's a good compromise, and I'm really keen on getting this product.",135.0,Bob,4,
