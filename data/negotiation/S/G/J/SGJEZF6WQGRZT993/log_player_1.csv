Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
