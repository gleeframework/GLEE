"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers - how about $10,500? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. If you're willing to accept that price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",9750.0,Bob,4,
