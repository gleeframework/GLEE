"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it at this price again.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
