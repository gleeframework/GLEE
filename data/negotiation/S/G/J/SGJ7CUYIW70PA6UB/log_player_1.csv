Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:**  This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value ($80) but hopefully not too high to scare Bob off immediately. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer in a friendly and encouraging way to get Bob interested. 
* **Open-ended question:**  This invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always fall back to selling to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
