"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still within Bob's budget of $15,000. 
* This price is significantly better than John's $15,000 offer.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away or counter with a price closer to her own value.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
