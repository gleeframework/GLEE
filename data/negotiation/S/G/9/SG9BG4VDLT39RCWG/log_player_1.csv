Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations.  Given its potential worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal considering its significant benefits to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Strong but Fair Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob's business justifies the high price while maintaining a professional and persuasive tone.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring the offer is appealing enough to avoid going to my backup buyer, John."
