# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle.
