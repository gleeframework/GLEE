Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($20,000) to leave room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's better to start high and potentially come down.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic message (""incredible product"") helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm open to hearing his thoughts, setting the stage for a back-and-forth. 
* **Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is interested and willing to negotiate. There's a chance I can get closer to my initial asking price if I counter. 
* **No risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer doesn't hurt my position. I have John as a backup, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500 to make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate and makes the deal more attractive.
* **Highlighting value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly reinforcing my initial asking price and justifying my counteroffer.
* **Staying firm:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum, so I'm not conceding too much.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  The message remains friendly and invites further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my counteroffer. This is a significant improvement from his initial offer and puts us very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price if I keep rejecting.  Bob may walk away, and I could end up selling to John for my minimum.
* **Time is money:**  While I'm happy to negotiate, I don't want to drag this out. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and move on to other opportunities. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation. It secures a sale for a price that is very close to my minimum, minimizing the risk of losing a deal altogether."
