Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $950,000. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While it's less than my ideal price, getting $950,000 is a reasonable compromise at this point in the negotiation.  Bob is clearly holding firm, and I'd rather secure a good deal now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
