# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's worth more than that to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer
