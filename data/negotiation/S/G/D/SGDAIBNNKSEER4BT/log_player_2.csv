"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum and John's offer. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer:

* **Starts significantly lower:**  This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a much better price. 
* **Is below your maximum:** You have some wiggle room to potentially increase your offer if needed.
* **Pressures Alice:** Alice knows you have the option to go with John, so she might be more inclined to accept a lower price rather than lose the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however, I can't go as low as $10,000. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still above your ideal price and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Shows Willingness to Negotiate:** By increasing your offer, you demonstrate that you are serious about buying and willing to compromise.
* **Stays Below John's Price:** You're still aiming for a price that's better than what John offers, maintaining your negotiating leverage.
* **Targets a Middle Ground:** This offer splits the difference between your last offer and Alice's counteroffer,  potentially leading to a faster agreement."
