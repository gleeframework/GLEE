Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $75?

While negotiating with Bob might eventually lead to a sale, it's unlikely he'll go above $80.  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome than continuing with an uncertain negotiation."
