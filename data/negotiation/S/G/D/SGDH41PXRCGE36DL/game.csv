"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $10,500 for this product. It's a final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
