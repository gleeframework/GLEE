Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm not willing to settle for less.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's between his offer and my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him.  If not, I'll have to reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit in his offer, and I'm now at a point where I'm confident I can't get a significantly better price from him. Selling to John would mean a loss for me, so accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
