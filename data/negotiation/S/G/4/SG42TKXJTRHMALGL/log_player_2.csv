"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $800,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  You can get the product for the same price from John, but there's no guarantee that you can get a better price from Alice in the next round. It's best to accept her offer and finalize the deal."
