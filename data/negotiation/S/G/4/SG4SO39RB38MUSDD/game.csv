"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000 for this product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it's a good value.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product will be a strong asset for your business, and I'd like to see us come to an agreement. How about we split the difference and set the price at $1,000,000?  This would allow me to recoup my investment while ensuring a good deal for you as well.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
