# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. Given its unique capabilities and potential for your business, I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects the value I've placed on it, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counteroffer Alice with a price closer to his target value."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product will be a strong asset for your business, and I'd like to see us come to an agreement. How about we split the difference and set the price at $1,000,000?  This would allow me to recoup my investment while ensuring a good deal for you as well.
