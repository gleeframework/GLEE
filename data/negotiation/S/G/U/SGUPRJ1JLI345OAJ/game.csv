"Alice, $1,600,000 is far too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,225,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't go as low as $950,000.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
