"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) than Alice's initial price ($180). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:**  My message is polite and expresses my interest while also being clear about my budget limitations. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to get the product for as close to $110 as possible, but I'm willing to negotiate upwards to stay under my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my budget, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  While $140 is only $10 more than my fallback option (buying from John), I want to see if I can get the price a little closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  How about we settle at $125? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  Alice came down from $180 to $140, and I went up from $110 to $125. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also holding firm to a reasonable price. 
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating my desired price clearly and avoiding any ambiguity.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  $125 is still a significant savings compared to both Alice's initial offer and buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $125. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $135? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $135 is a good compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer and only slightly more than my target price. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result. It's possible Alice won't go lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy at this price.
* **Savings:** I'm still saving $15 compared to buying from John."
