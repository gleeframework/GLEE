"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price.  $1,225,000 is closer, but I'd need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. Would that be feasible?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
