"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point. $12,000 is well above your budget, so rejecting the offer makes sense. You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,000 is closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to keep pushing for your desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,000 is still a little out of my range.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
