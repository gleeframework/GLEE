"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me right now.  How about we start the conversation at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. Would you be willing to agree to $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
