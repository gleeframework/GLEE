Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me right now.  How about we start the conversation at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your price point. Would you be willing to agree to $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000). There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better price. Accepting John's offer ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without the risk of further negotiation."
