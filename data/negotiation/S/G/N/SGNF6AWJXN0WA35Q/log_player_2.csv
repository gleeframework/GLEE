Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice is very slowly approaching her value. We're getting close to a point where accepting might be the best option, but let's try one more time to nudge her down a bit."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $11,250, but I think I can do better than that. Let's try $11,500 one last time. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that she's close to her limit.  While we might be able to get the price a little lower, it's unlikely to be much. Accepting at $11,500 secures a decent price and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
