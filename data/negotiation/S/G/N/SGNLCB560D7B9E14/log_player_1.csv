Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,500,000
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $800,000 
* **Negotiation space:** There's a significant gap between our valuations.
* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting high at $1,750,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows for room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my valuation.  By starting high, I create pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $900,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 
* **Selling to John:**  I can secure a much better price by selling to John, who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My previous offer was too high, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price in the middle of our previous positions ($900,000 and $1,750,000). 
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to accept a low price. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** $1,250,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than my valuation but significantly more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** I've already made a counteroffer, and Bob's counteroffers are not moving closer to my desired price.
* **Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and a better financial outcome.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to lead to a significantly better offer, and I don't want to waste time and potentially lose the chance to sell to John."
