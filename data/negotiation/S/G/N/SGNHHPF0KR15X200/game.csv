"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $11,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is the absolute maximum I can offer. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
