Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a higher number in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $950,000 is a good price and closer to what I was hoping for. While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
