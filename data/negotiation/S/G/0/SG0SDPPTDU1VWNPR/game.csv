"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's even more valuable to you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
