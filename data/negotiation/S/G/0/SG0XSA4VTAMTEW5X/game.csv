"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,650,000.  This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
