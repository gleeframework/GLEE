"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
