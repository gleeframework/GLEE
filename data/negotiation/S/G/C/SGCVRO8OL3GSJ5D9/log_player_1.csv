Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves us both with a fair profit. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close enough to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John."
