"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1500000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $1400000, which leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. $1250000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves us both with a fair profit. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1350000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
