"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer you $775,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This is a good compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.  Let's wrap this up and make a deal!",812500.0,Alice,7,
