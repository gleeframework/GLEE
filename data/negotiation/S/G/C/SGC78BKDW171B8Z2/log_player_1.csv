Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work towards a better deal. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price and still have several rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I believe $12,000 is a reasonable price. However, I am willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my desired price, and I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, securing a good profit."
