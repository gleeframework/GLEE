"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this deal, but I'm also open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1050000 is a bit too low for my comfort. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1250000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1150000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but $1150000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of $1225000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1225000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1175000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above that threshold. I'm thinking of $1200000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still not willing to go back to $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1150000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1200000 is too low, and $1250000 is too high, so I'm going to meet you in the middle of that range. I'm offering the product to you for $1225000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,9,
