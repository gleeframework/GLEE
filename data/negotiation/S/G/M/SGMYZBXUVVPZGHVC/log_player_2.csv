You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90?  Let's meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $80 guarantees the best price."
