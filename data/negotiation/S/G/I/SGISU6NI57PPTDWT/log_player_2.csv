"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer is too high.  It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's acceptable range.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly to $950,000.  This is a smaller step than before, showing that he's getting closer to his limit, but still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth seeing if Bob can negotiate a lower price from Alice before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob is going to make a final counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is his absolute maximum price. If Alice rejects this, he'll go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price, and it seems unlikely she will go lower.  At this point, it's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation."
