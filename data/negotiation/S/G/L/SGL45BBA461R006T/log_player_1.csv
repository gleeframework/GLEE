Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
