"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $1000000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1175000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
