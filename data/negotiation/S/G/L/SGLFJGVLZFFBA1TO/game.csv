"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. It's a significant amount, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000 for the product?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  To be fair to both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer and allows you to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move on if it's not acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than my previous offer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
