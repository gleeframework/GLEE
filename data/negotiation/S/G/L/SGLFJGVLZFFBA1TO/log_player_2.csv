Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  To be fair to both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer and allows you to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to move on if it's not acceptable to you.
