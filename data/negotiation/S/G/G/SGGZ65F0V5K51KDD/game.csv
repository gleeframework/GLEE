"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me. While I'm very interested, $9500 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $9500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8800. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",8800.0,Alice,5,
