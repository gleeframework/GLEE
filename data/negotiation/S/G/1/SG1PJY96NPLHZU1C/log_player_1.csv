{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum, leaving room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Provides a compelling reason:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, encouraging him to consider accepting. 

I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll have to carefully consider his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to lower my price before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still not ideal. I believe there's more room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** I'm not completely rejecting Bob's offer, showing him I'm open to compromise.
* **Provides a reasonable compromise:**  I'm only asking for $50,000 more than Bob's offer, a relatively small amount compared to the overall price.
* **Reiterates the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hopefully making him reconsider his position.

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to be flexible to secure a deal. I'll keep John's offer in mind as I evaluate Bob's next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $825,000 is the highest I can go. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about losing $175,000 from my minimum price, Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to the value he placed on the product ($800,000).  He's showing a reluctance to go higher, and further negotiation might lead to a lower price. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further risk of a lower offer from Bob.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
