"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This feels like a fair price point that considers the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. $10,750 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a final price that works for both of us. My final offer is $10,250.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10250.0,Bob,6,
