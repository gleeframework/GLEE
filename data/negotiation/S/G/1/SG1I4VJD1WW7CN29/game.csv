"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me a bit, that price is still a little too high for my budget. Could we possibly settle around  $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing some progress here, but we're still a ways off.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,600,000 is still stretching my budget. I can do $1,350,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
