Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $17,500.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum value of $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I could potentially go back and forth with Bob for several rounds and end up getting a lower price.  It's better to take the offer and get the sale."
