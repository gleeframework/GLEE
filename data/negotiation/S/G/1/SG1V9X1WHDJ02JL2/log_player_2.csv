Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum buying price. It's best to negotiate down or consider John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price.  It sets a low starting point for negotiation while still leaving room to increase the offer if needed."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  How about $115? That's my final offer.
