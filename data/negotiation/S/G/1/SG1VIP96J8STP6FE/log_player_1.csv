Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is still likely to accept. 

Here's why:

* **It's more than your minimum:**  You get $2,000 more than your minimum value, which is good.
* **It's less than Bob's maximum:** Bob gets a good deal as well, saving $2,000 of his potential value.
* **It's above John's offer:** This ensures you get a better price than your backup option.

By offering a price in the middle, you increase the chances of Bob accepting while still getting a good deal for yourself."
