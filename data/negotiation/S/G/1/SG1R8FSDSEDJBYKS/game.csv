"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $120. This is still a great price considering the value you'll get out of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $117.50. This would be a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $112?",112.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to go down to $114. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",114.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to go down to $114, but I'm still not sure that's the best deal for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,8,
