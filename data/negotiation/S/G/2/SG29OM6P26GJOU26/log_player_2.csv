"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering its high quality and unique benefits, I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant saving compared to its market value. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overselling:**  Alice claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, but you know it's only worth $10,000 to her. This suggests she's inflating the value.
* **Room for negotiation:** Her opening offer is $14,000. There's a good chance you can get her to lower the price further, especially since you have John as a backup option. 
* **Backup plan:** Having John willing to sell at $15,000 gives you leverage.  

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door to potentially getting a much better deal."
