{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential earnings. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a great deal for a product like this, and it gives us both some room to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while also holding firm on the value of the product. I'm also trying to keep the conversation positive and encouraging to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $160. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $140 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $150. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering my final counteroffer at my minimum acceptable price, highlighting that it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the deal and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, it's getting late and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150 from John.  I'll sell the product to John."
