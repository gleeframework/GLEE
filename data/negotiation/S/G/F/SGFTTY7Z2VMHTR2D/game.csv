"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit on your end while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,000,000 represents my initial valuation, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point acknowledges the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
