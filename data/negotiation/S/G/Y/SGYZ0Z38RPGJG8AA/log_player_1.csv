Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives me leverage in the negotiation."
