"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $60. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I want to see if we can make a deal. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, considering the price I have in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $75 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still quite a bit below my bottom line.  To be honest, I have another offer for close to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $100? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
