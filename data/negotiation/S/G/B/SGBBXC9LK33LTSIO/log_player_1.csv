**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't met my absolute bottom line, accepting his offer of $1,462,500 makes the most sense at this stage for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is likely small compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Strong Profit:** Even at $1,462,500, I'm making a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price.

It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's offer by pushing Bob too hard."
