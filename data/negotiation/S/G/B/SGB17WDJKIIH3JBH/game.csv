"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer you the product for $16,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
