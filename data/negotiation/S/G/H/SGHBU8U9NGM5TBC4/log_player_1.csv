"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position. This starting price is significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides ample room for negotiation, allowing you to make concessions strategically throughout the rounds.
* **Confident and Open Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value while expressing a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like a valued potential buyer. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how eager he is to purchase and how much he values the product.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for potentially securing a price significantly higher than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the product's value is not as high as you're suggesting. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its actual worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your aspiration and leaves a potential $300,000 on the table compared to your starting offer. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's seriously interested. You have room to negotiate further without seeming unreasonable, especially with eight rounds remaining.  

**Next Steps:**  You should counter with a price closer to $2,000,000 in the next round, maintaining a firm but negotiable stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is generous, I believe it undervalues some of the unique benefits and potential it holds. I'm willing to move closer to your number, how about we consider $2,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counter-offer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By subtly reminding Bob of the ""unique benefits"" of the product, we aim to justify the higher price point without directly dismissing his valuation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** The offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and encourages Bob to continue engaging.  

The goal is to gradually bridge the gap between your aspirations and Bob's perceived value, striving for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my initial offer, Alice. However, I still believe the product's value is not as high as you're suggesting. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's actual worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is a strong deal for you. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You are securing a profit of over $500,000 above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise by meeting you halfway between your previous offer and his. This suggests it's unlikely he'll go much higher.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or even walking away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit immediately. 

While you could push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. This offer represents a successful negotiation outcome."
