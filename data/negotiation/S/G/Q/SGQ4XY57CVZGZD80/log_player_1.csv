"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust accordingly.  Remember, I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is far too low for me.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than half of my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a significant profit.  $17,500 is a fair compromise that acknowledges his interest while ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with $12,000.  I'll make another counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't budge much, I'm prepared to sell to John for a safe $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer again, but I'm still not going to budge much.  $16,000 is a reasonable price for both of us, and it's still a significant profit for me.  If he rejects, I'm going to start seriously considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value.  While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  If I reject again, there's a good chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only John's offer. I'm going to take the $14,000 and close the deal."
