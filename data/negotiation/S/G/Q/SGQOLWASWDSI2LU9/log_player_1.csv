"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for some back and forth without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the value to Bob can encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:** 
My goal is to secure as much profit as possible while keeping the negotiation open. I'm willing to lower the price slightly in future rounds if needed, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This indicates there's room for a compromise.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still achieve a higher price by making a counteroffer in the next round.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, but I'll keep the negotiation open. My goal is to reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This reflects the value it offers you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the justification for a higher price.
* **Fairness:** By framing it as a ""fair deal for both of us,"" I'm appealing to Bob's sense of reason and encouraging a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

I believe this counteroffer is a strong balance between pushing for a good price and remaining open to negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a deal close to my desired price, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if Bob refuses to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 aligns with my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better result.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Pushing for a higher price might lead to Bob withdrawing his offer entirely, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for the same price.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point. While I would prefer a higher price, it's important to secure the deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
