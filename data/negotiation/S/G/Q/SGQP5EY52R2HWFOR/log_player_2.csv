I'm starting low, but I'm willing to negotiate.  $300,000 is a fair price, considering the potential value to me."

$400,000 is still a good price, but I'm determined to get it even lower. I'll try one more counteroffer before resorting to John."

Alice has moved closer to my price point.  While I'd love to get it lower, $450,000 is a significant savings over John's price, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity."
