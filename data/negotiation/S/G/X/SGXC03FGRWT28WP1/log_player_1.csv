Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so this price is attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It allows for potential counteroffers without immediately giving away all of your potential profit.
* **Is above your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you still make a good profit.

I'll be watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my goal of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me!  While I'd prefer to sell for $12,500, $12,000 is still significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
