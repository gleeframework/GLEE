Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that's a bit higher than the minimum value I have in mind. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}

I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, and this offer gives me some room to negotiate. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'm not thrilled about accepting it. However, I also don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Considering I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, I think I'll take the sure thing and sell the product to John.
