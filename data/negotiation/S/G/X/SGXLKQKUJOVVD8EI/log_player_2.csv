"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My starting price is $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since Alice's offer is higher than his maximum price, he should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. How about $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to his target price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $120, which is my absolute limit.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 120}
