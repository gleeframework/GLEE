# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,700 is closer to his ideal price, it's still above his initial counteroffer. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price again."
