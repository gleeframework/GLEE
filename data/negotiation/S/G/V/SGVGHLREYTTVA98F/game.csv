"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $925,000 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting down to the wire. I'm willing to go up to $910,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to go with a different option.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $910,000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $920,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",920000.0,Alice,7,
