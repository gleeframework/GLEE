"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to acquire this product at a slightly lower point.  I'd be willing to pay $1250000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product at $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and budget.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm ready to finalize the purchase at $1275000. This reflects a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
