# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. He can likely still negotiate a lower price than $13,000, so it's worth another round of counteroffers."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a significant profit on this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now asking for $14,000, which is getting closer to John's price of $15,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that the price might go up even further, potentially costing Bob more than $15,000. Buying from John guarantees a known price within Bob's budget."
