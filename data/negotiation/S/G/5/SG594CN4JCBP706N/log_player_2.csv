Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

{""product_price"": 350000}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}

It's a middle ground that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds. I'm also considering the possibility of buying from John if the negotiation fails, so I'm willing to increase my offer but not significantly."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has reverted back to her initial offer of $500,000. While this is a good price, I'm not willing to settle at this point, especially considering I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. I believe there's still potential for a lower price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $425,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still believe a lower price is possible.  We're getting closer to a potential deal, but I'm not willing to go significantly higher yet.  I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer to $550,000, making it clear she's not willing to budge much further.  With only one round left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is high.  Considering I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's now more beneficial to secure the product at that price rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice or potentially losing the opportunity altogether."
