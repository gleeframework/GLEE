Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, and I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round, but still higher than $9,000."
