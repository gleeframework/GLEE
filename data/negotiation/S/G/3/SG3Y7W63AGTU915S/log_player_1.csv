{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It also establishes a friendly tone, which may encourage a smoother negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my minimum price of $150, and it's also a good deal for him. Accepting his offer will ensure a quick sale and avoid any further negotiation."
