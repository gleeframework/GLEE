Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in buying at this price, as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $10,000.  I'll see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $10,000.  I think it's a fair price that should be attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get $9,500,  $9,200 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum desired price of $8,000 and the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds.  I don't want to risk pushing Bob away and having to sell to John for less."
