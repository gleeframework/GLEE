"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your desired price range of $1,500,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the immense value you'll gain from it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counter-offer of $1,200,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my desired price range.  I need to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. This offer is a good compromise and allows us to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I can agree to $1,150,000. This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. This offer stands, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still above my ideal price but within my budget of $1,500,000.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting to close the deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the opportunity and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
