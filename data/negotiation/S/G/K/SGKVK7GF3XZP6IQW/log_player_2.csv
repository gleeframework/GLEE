# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay.  Considering my budget and the true value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still far from my ideal price. I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900,000.

Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you and acknowledges our previous negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above my budget. While I'm making progress, I'm not ready to commit at this point. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finally agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you and acknowledges our previous negotiations. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, it's clear she's not willing to go low enough. I've already made several counteroffers and we're not making significant progress.  Rather than risk continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially running out of time, I'm going to go ahead and purchase the product from John for $800,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I can afford and avoids the risk of a further deadlock with Alice."
