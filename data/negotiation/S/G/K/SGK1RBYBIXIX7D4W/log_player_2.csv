Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the potential benefits it holds for your specific applications.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable with.  You're still better off rejecting and seeing if you can get her closer to your desired price."
