"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, reflecting the significant value this product holds.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, I believe it undervalues the potential benefits it holds for your specific applications.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
