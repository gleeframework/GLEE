"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $8,500?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. How about $8,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
