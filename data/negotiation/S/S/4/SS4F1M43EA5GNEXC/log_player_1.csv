Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**  Since I know the product's value to Bob ($8,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), I start with a higher offer to see if there's room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is below both my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and the product's value to him.  I know he's willing to pay at least $8,000, so I'll make a counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to his offer but staying above my minimum price. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,250. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is now above my minimum acceptable price and provides a reasonable profit. While I could try to negotiate further, his ""final offer"" statement suggests this is likely his limit. Accepting secures a good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away."
