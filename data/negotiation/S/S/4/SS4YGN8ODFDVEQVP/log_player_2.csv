"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that benefits both of us. I am willing to consider $1,300,000 for the product, which is higher than your offer but still within my valuation range. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  It's also worth noting that Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000 at any time, so there's no immediate urgency to accept an offer that's outside his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price that's within both our budgets. Let's close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I am willing to lower my asking price to $1,275,000. This still represents a premium value for the product, while being more accommodating to your budget. I hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, but it's still $75,000 higher than what he could get from John. Since Bob is looking to save as much money as possible, it's more beneficial for him to buy from John immediately and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
