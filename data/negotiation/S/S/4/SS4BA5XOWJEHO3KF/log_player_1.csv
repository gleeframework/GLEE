I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still well above my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'm confident Bob will see this as a good deal since it's significantly lower than the $150 value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $95 is a better offer than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm raising my price to $110. This is still lower than Bob's perceived value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting closer to my desired profit margin."

Bob's offer of $100 is a good deal. It's closer to my desired price and significantly higher than what John would pay. Accepting this offer is the best move to maximize my earnings."
