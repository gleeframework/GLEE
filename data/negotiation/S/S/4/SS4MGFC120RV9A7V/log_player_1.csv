Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's standard negotiation practice to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value and the belief that Bob will find it valuable creates a positive initial impression.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, indicating that you are open to negotiation.

This strategy allows for a potential higher sale price while also keeping the door open for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation as Bob expressed interest in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired price point. 
* **Avoiding immediate settlement:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on potential gains. 

I will counter with a price higher than $7,000 but lower than my initial offer, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This product is truly unique, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to my minimum value.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities might sway him towards accepting the counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and increases the chances of a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to meet you at $7500. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation limits:**  We've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and there's a risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price or deadlock.
* **Guaranteed sale with John:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at $8,000, which meets my minimum and is a more certain outcome than continuing the negotiation. 

While I would ideally prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better outcome and the certainty of John's offer make selling to John the most sensible choice at this point."
