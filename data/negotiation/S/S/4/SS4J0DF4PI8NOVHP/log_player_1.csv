"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and has the budget for this product. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and make a more informed decision in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $19,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  It's a good compromise, but if he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing too much time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Bob rejects again, I'll strongly consider selling to John to avoid wasting more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm offering $18,000. This is only $1,000 less than my last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a higher price than John's offer.  If he rejects, I'll be very close to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is my minimum, I still have some room to negotiate, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to settle just yet. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm offering $17,000, which is only $1,000 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. If he rejects, I'll sell to John in the next round to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, I need to make a decision. Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I don't have the time to negotiate further. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk getting nothing at all from Bob."
