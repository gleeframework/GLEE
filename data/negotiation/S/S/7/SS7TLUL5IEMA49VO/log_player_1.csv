Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim to get as close to that price as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount if he's inclined to negotiate. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to Bob's perceived value ($100) might insult him or make him think the product is of low quality. 

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing his own valuation is much lower. However, this strategy ensures you maximize your potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you simply sell to John at your desired price."
