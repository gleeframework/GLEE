"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted in your product, $750000 is unfortunately outside my budget at this time. I'm very interested in exploring this further, and I'm willing to pay up to $1000000. Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to extend a revised offer for our flagship product. Given your expressed willingness to pay up to $1000000, I am now prepared to consider a price of $900000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from our original asking price while still allowing us to maintain a fair valuation for our offering. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we split the difference and settle on $850000? This would allow me to secure the product while still staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
