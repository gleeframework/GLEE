Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This keeps the deal possible.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  This avoids scaring Bob off immediately.

Let me know if you want to revise the offer or have any questions!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you considering me, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:**  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Stays above my minimum:**  It keeps me from selling at a loss. 
* **Is still attractive to Bob:**  It's lower than my initial offer, and  closer to his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $130.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can make a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. Since John is willing to pay $150, I'll go ahead and sell to him."
