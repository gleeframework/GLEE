"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your own profit margin.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with your budget.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
