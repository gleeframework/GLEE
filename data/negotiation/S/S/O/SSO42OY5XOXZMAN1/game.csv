"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm very interested in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is the highest I can go, given my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you've outlined.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a significant effort to reach a deal, Bob. However, I need to consider my minimum acceptable price, and $900,000 is still below that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
