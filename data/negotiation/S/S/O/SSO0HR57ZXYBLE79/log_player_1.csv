Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" subtly leverages John's offer, reminding Bob that he could miss out if he hesitates.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
