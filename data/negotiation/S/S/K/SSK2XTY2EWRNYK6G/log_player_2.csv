Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still not where I want to be. I'm going to try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer."
