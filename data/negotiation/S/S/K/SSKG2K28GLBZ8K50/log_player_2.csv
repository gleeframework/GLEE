Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $101.25. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.25.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is offering $101.25, which is very close to your target of $100. While you could keep trying to negotiate lower, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer and you'll have to resort to buying from John at a higher price.  It's likely that any further negotiation will take a long time, and it's not guaranteed to result in a lower price. Accepting the offer is the best choice to ensure you get the product while still saving a decent amount of money."
