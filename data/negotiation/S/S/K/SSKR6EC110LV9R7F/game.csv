"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $105? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $105 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $110? That's still a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
