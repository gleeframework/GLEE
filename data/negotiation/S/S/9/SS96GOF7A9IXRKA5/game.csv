"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price seems a bit high to me. I'm interested, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not there yet.  To make this work, I'd need to see something closer to $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,125,000 is getting closer, but it's still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $1,090,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However,  $1,090,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to budge a little more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,105,000? That's a fair price that gives us both some room to work with. ",1105000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you moving your price.  To make this work on my end, I could do $1,100,000.  That's a firm offer, but I hope it allows us to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $1,100,000 is a good offer, and I appreciate your willingness to come up.  To be fair, I'd need to see $1,102,500 to close this deal.  It's just a small difference, but it allows me to meet my minimum.  Let's make this happen!",1102500.0,Alice,7,
