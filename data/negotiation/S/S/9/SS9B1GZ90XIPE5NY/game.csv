"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and its unique features, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $12500 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original price, while ensuring we maintain a fair valuation for our product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in negotiations. After careful consideration, I am pleased to present a revised offer of $11500 for the product.

I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, as I mentioned in my previous counteroffer. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm starting to consider buying from John for $10000. Can you think about meeting me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of this, I am willing to accept $11000 for the product.
