Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to his own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price of $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $960,000. While it's slightly lower than my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm happy with this outcome, as it's significantly higher than what John is offering."
