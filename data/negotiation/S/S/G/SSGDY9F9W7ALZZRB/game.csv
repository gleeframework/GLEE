"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensure a successful partnership. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this price is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $925,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $925,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm confident this price will be a wise investment for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $912,500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",912500.0,Bob,6,
