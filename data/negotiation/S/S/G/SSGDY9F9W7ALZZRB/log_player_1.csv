"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this unique product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects its true worth and potential for your business. I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still within a range Bob might be willing to consider, knowing he values the product at $800,000.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value and potential of the product for Bob, making him think about the long-term benefits.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The initial price allows for negotiation and a potential compromise. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 provides me with leverage and a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  
* **I have leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  By rejecting, I can counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range. 

I believe there is room for further negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than Bob's current offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value and potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensure a successful partnership. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm confident this price is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value and potential to reinforce its worth.
* **Focus on Partnership:**  The phrase ""successful partnership"" subtly frames the deal as a win-win situation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  While I'm proposing $1,050,000, I'm also signaling that I'm open to further negotiation. 

This counteroffer provides a middle ground that balances my desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $925,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, which is important as we are nearing the middle of the negotiation process.
* **Potential for further compromise:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range.

I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to explore it further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $925,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm confident this price will be a wise investment for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, lowering the price by only $75,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a strong position.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Mutual Benefit Focus:**  I'm highlighting the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting my offer.
* **Commitment to Solution:**  The statement ""commitment to finding a solution"" conveys that I'm serious about reaching a deal.

This counteroffer presents a more reasonable price point while still keeping the focus on the value and potential of the product. It aims to strike a balance between compromise and maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $912,500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** We're now nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. 
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me my desired price.
* **Risk of Further Decline:**  Continuing the negotiation risks Bob lowering his offer even further, potentially below my minimum. 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk ending up with a lower price than my minimum.  Selling to John secures my desired profit, making it the most sensible decision at this point."
