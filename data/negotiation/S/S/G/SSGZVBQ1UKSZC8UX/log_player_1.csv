Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly."
