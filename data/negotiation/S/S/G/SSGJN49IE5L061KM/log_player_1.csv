"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This allows room for negotiation and ensures I don't undervalue my own worth. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to be bold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I want to push for a higher price, knowing I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  I want to be realistic about Bob's limits, but also show I'm not willing to settle for his first counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my desired price point, and we're only on round 4. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by being too stubborn. It's also a good starting point for future negotiations if I ever need to sell a similar product."
