"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's be realistic. $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
