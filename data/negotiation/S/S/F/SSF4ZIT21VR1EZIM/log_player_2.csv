"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly less than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still closer to her initial offer than our counter. We should push for a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential deal. This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice has come down to her value for the product. Accepting this offer gets us the product for significantly less than John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
