"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $10,000.  This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and may be enticing enough for Alice to consider. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still several rounds remaining.  Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a lower price alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous one, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  This strategy aims to find a middle ground and potentially encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, the offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate. Rejecting the offer maintains the possibility of achieving a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer, but this time by a smaller margin. He's getting closer to Alice's price while still aiming for a deal below $11,500. With only four rounds left, he needs to start bridging the gap. This counteroffer is a good compromise and potentially more attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases.  Alice's offer of $11,800 is only $200 more than Bob's previous counteroffer, and it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price, within his budget, and avoids the risk of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
