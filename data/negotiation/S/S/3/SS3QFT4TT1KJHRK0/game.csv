Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.,90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $82.50. It's still a great deal considering the value it brings to you.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a little high for me though.  Let's split the difference and settle on $80.  That way, we both get a good deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $2.50 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $81.25, which is still a great deal for both of us. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to get the product to someone who truly appreciates its value.",81.25,Alice,5,
