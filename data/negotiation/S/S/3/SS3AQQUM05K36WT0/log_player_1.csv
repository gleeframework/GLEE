Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 Bob's offer is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher return, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above what I can afford. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,300,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's time to close the deal."
