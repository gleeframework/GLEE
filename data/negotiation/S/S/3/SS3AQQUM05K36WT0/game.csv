"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate your understanding of the value of this product. While $1,250,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher return, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above what I can afford. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
