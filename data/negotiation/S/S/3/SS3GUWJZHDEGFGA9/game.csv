"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $1650000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1675000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
