"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The product is worth $80 to Alice and $100 to you.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offers.** This gives you a chance to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is not ideal.** While it's a guaranteed option, it's the most expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** My counteroffer is $10 below Alice's initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair price:**  $85 is a reasonable price that is still above Alice's value for the product.
* **Room for compromise:** This gives Alice some wiggle room to accept, but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above my desired price. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  I'm willing to pay closer to $85, so rejecting allows me to continue negotiating.
* **Buying from John is still not ideal.** While it's a backup option, it's more expensive than I'd like to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing my offer slightly:** I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still staying below my maximum price.
* **Closing the gap:** My counteroffer is now only $2 away from Alice's latest offer, making a deal more likely.
* **Remaining within my budget:** $88 is still within my acceptable price range."
