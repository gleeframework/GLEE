Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's room to negotiate downwards.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and implies exclusivity by mentioning a public listing. This creates a sense of scarcity and potential loss if Bob declines.
* **Safety Net:** We know John will buy the product for $15,000, so any offer accepted by Bob above that price is a win for Alice.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her price during the negotiation."
