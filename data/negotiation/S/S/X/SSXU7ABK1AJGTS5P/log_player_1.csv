{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I am hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'm prepared to counter-offer based on his response. I also have the option of selling to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $125 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal.  I've already lowered my price twice and Bob doesn't seem willing to budge much further.  To avoid further negotiations and guarantee a sale above my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
