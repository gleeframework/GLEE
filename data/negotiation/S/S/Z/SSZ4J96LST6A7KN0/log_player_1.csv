{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $130 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by building a rapport with Bob and emphasizing the value of the product. The price is set at $130, which leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $110 at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for $110 just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us and ensures you get this great product."", ""product_price"": 120}
