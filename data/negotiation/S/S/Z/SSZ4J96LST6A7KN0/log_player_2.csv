"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $130 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice is asking for $130. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving some money. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback.** If negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $110 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us and ensures you get this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is now asking for $120.
* **Negotiation has reached a reasonable point.** While you could try to negotiate further, the difference between $120 and your desired price of $110 is relatively small. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $30 compared to buying from John.

It's generally good to weigh the potential savings against the effort and risk of further negotiation. In this case, accepting the offer seems like the most sensible choice."
