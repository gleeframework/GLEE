Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum threshold. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than further negotiation with Bob."
