"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $16,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $14,500. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on my investment. I'm thinking of $15,500. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $15,250. This is my final offer, as I have another option for acquiring the product at this price.  Let me know what you think.",15250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to walking away, Bob, and I don't want to lose the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, but I'll throw in a small concession. I'll sell it to you for $15,250, but I'll also include a free accessory that's worth $500. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,7,
