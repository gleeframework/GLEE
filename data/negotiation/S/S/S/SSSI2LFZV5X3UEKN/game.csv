"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you can do that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
