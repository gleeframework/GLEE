"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a special price of $18,000. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll appreciate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. This is my best offer, as it's my maximum limit."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price point. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer and trying to get closer to $12,000 makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to buy the product today."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $13,000 yet. I'm willing to compromise further at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still well above Bob's budget of $12,000.  At this point, it's clear that further negotiation with Alice may not lead to a price within his range, and it's better to secure the product from John for his maximum price."
