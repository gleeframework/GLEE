"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is below Bob's maximum, it's still above Alice's minimum.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum price. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
