Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $115. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $115 gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to maximize your profit. This approach aims to secure a sale with Bob, eliminating the need to go with John's lower offer."
