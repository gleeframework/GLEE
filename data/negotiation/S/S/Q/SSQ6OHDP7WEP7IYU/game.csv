"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested in the product, I'm aiming to stay closer to my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?  I'm confident this is still a fair price for a product with such value.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you.
