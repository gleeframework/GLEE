"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which is $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,5,
