{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. You have a significant margin to work with, and you could potentially save a considerable amount of money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, while still leaving room for further bargaining."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial offer, but there's still room to negotiate. I'm aiming for a lower price and believe I can get it.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round but keeping it significantly lower than Alice's new offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to reach a price that's closer to my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum price, and it's only $100,000 more than my last counteroffer.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice getting more stubborn and refusing to budge further is high.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a reasonable price within my budget.  There's a good chance I could get a lower price with more negotiation, but the risk of walking away with nothing or having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
