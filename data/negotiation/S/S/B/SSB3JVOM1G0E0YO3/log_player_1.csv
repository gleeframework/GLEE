Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $15,000 from Bob, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob is willing to pay $15,000 but also showing that I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's only $200 less than my last counteroffer and it's still a profitable deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and I'm not comfortable with the potential of having to sell to John for the minimum price."
