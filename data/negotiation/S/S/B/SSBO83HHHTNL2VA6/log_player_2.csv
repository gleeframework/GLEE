"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,350,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,400,000, which is still within your budget of $1,500,000.  It's a better price than what John is offering, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this situation."
