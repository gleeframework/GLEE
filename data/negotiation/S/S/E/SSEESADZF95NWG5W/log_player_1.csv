"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to meet me in the middle this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to get more, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
