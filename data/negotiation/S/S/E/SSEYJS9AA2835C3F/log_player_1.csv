"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm confident in the product's worth, but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial counteroffer but shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I have more negotiation rounds left and want to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  This demonstrates continued flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. With only 5 rounds left, it's important to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to secure a deal.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
