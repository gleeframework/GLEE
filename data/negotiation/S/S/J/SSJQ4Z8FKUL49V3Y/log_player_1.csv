{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'll be ready to come down a little, but I'm hoping to get as close to $900,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

$750,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."

{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm coming down a little from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target.  $850,000 is a fair compromise.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, but this is my absolute lowest. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and Bob has finally met that price.  It's time to close the deal!"
