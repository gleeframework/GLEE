Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $975,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we discuss $990,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

While aiming higher is tempting, Bob's offer of $990,000 is a strong deal. We are already in round 6, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting secures a substantial profit above John's offer."
