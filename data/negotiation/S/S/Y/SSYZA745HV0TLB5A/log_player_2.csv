"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still higher than the product's value to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my eagerness to negotiate.
* **Fair but Firm:**  $11,000 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, so there's room for her to profit.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message shows I'm open to discussing further, leaving room for a possible middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** Alice's offer of $12,000 represents a compromise and is significantly better than buying from John. 
* **Value for Both:**  While $12,000 is above Alice's value, it's a fair price that allows her to make a profit. For me, it's a good deal given the potential for a better price from John. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays."
