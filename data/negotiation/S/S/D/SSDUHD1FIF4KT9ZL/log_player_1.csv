"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is considerably higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price is more than fair considering the potential this product holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we seem to be pretty far apart on price still.  I can appreciate your position, but $2,000,000 is just not feasible for me. To move this forward, I can offer $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both my minimum and the product's actual worth to him. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand mine as well.  This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and $1,100,000 doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to drop to $1,800,000, which is a significant concession on my part, but I need you to meet me closer to that mark."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,800,000 is still much higher than I can justify. To be frank, I can do $1,250,000.  If that doesn't work, we may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and his increments are getting smaller. While he's showing more willingness to negotiate, I'm not confident he'll reach a number close enough to my target in the remaining rounds.  I need to push him higher or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty. However, the price you're suggesting is still significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Constraint:**  We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Firm Stance:** It's time to signal a firm stance to Bob. This makes it clear that my willingness to negotiate further is limited.
* **Balancing Act:** The offer is still significantly above Bob's, but it leaves some room for him to potentially counter with something closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  I need to be prepared to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he doesn't meet my needs. John's standing offer provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product does have value, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford.  Your final offer is still quite a ways off from what I can do. I can go up to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, and I understand if you need to walk away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has clearly signaled that $1,350,000 is his absolute limit.  He's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Minimal Gains:**  While I could counter in the next round, the potential gains are minimal.  Bob is unlikely to suddenly jump close to my $1,600,000. Even if I can push him slightly higher, it won't be a significant difference from John's offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed. There's no risk of further negotiation or losing the sale entirely.

At this point, the certainty and minimal difference in profit make selling to John the most logical decision."
