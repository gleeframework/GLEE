"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and leaves room for mutual benefit.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is considerably higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true market value. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price is more than fair considering the potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be pretty far apart on price still.  I can appreciate your position, but $2,000,000 is just not feasible for me. To move this forward, I can offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need you to understand mine as well.  This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and $1,100,000 doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to drop to $1,800,000, which is a significant concession on my part, but I need you to meet me closer to that mark.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,800,000 is still much higher than I can justify. To be frank, I can do $1,250,000.  If that doesn't work, we may need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. However, the price you're suggesting is still significantly lower than what I can accept. This product has substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, this product does have value, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford.  Your final offer is still quite a ways off from what I can do. I can go up to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, and I understand if you need to walk away.",1350000.0,Bob,8,
