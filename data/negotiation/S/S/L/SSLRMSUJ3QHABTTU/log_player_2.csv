"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's closer to his target of $13,500 and is significantly better than buying from John at $15,000. While there's always a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or going through more rounds outweighs the potential savings."
