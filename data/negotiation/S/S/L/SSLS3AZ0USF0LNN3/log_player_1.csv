Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate. 

My rationale:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A higher initial offer potentially gives me a better starting point for negotiations.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This offer will quickly indicate if Bob is seriously interested in buying. If he rejects outright, it suggests he's not willing to pay much more than his perceived value. 
* **Keep John as a Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, so I'm not pressured to make a deal with Bob if it's not financially advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe I can push him a little higher with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I have John as a backup, so I don't need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my financial goals.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than $140, aiming for a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This is a slight compromise from my initial offer of $170, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Agreement:** It's still above Bob's offer of $140, giving us a potential middle ground.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:** This price keeps me above my minimum of $150 and allows for a decent profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise considering his initial offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to reassess my strategy based on his next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** While $145 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin and not a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer.
* **Time and Effort:** Negotiating further with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and might not lead to a significantly better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John is a guaranteed buyer at $150, which ensures a reliable and profitable sale. 

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most logical and efficient decision in this situation. It minimizes my risk and ensures a sale that meets my minimum profit requirement."
