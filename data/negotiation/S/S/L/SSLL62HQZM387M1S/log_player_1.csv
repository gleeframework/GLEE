Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a good starting point.** It's above your minimum of $80, but leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $120.
* **Being open to negotiation shows flexibility.** This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially offer a higher price.
* **Asking for his opinion (""What do you think?"") encourages active participation.** This helps build rapport and potentially leads to a smoother negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below my desired price. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to potentially get closer to my target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to the middle:** $92.50 is right in the middle of my desired price ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). 
* **Reasoning for the counteroffer:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer by mentioning that it's a fair price for both of us.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  Using phrases like ""appreciate your offer"" and ""I think that's a fair price for both of us"" maintains a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go as low as $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price of $100 and significantly higher than selling to John for $80.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a much better result, and risking losing the sale to John isn't worth it. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price and avoid potential further delays or a lower price."
