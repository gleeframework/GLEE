Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see its value, I can't go as high as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $8,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk Bob walking away."
