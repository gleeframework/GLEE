"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to pay John $15,000, so there's room for negotiation."
