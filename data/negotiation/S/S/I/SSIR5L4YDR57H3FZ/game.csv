"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $75?  Let's see if we can work something out.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really hoping to get this product, but $80 is my absolute limit.  Would you be willing to accept that?",80.0,Bob,4,
