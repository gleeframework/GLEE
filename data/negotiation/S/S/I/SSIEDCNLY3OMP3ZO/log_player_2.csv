Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly trying to hold firm around the $78 mark.  It's a decent price, and further haggling might not yield much better.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the price going up or missing out entirely."
