Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a decent price considering Bob's offer was too low."
