Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $90. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, though. How about we meet at $87? It's the best I can do.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it's time to cut your losses and buy from him."
