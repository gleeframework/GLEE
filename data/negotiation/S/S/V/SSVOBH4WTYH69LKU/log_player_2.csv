# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $900,000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe it could be a great fit for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it could be a great fit for you. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident this price is fair given the value I see in this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still slightly above your maximum budget.  Since you've already made your final offer and Alice has countered, it's likely further negotiation will only result in a stalemate.  It's better to take the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
