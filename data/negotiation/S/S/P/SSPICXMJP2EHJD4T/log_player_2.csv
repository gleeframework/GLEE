"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the current market, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's essential to reject this offer and start negotiating.  There's no reason to accept a price that's significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, especially since he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $17,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum limit. Bob needs to continue negotiating to get the price down further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $17,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the market.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
