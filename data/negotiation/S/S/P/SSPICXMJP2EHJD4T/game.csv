"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $17,500 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and the market.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
