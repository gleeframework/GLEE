{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, so starting at $150 is a good starting point. 
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off right away, so $150 is still a reasonable price for a potentially valuable product.
* **It includes a friendly message:**  A personal touch can make Bob more likely to engage with you.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the information you gather about his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, you can likely do better.  Bob is clearly interested, and you know the product is worth at least $100 to you. Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is your minimum price, and you have another buyer ready to pay that amount. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. You should accept John's offer and move on."
