{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a fair initial offer:** It leaves space for both of you to bargain. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you encourage Bob to negotiate, which could lead to a higher price for you. However, you're also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation, and I can always fall back to selling to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $9,250 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting close to my minimum price and I'm worried Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
