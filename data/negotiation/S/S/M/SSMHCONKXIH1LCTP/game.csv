"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  It represents a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This would still allow you to make a profit, and it's a price that is closer to my own valuation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to your valuation, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $812,500?  This is a good compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?",812500.0,Alice,5,
