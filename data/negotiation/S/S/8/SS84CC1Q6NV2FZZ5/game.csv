"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I think the product is valuable, but I'm not willing to pay $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment at that price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the price.  I can go as low as $12,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value this product will bring you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
