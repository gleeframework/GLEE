"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about $140? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $135 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $142. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you.",142.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $142 is the best deal. I'm willing to go up to $137, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",137.0,Bob,6,
