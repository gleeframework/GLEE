"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too far from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to go down to $900,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
