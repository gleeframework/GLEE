"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750.  This price is reasonable considering the product's value, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
