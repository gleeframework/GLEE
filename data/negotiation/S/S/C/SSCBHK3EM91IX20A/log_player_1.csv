{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to pay closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your kind gesture, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $100 on this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to sell the product for $100.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal for a product that's worth much more.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $125 is closer to my budget, I still feel that it might be too high for the value I place on the product. Would it be possible for us to reach an agreement at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  Since I'm confident I can sell to John for $150, it's in my best interest to accept his offer."
