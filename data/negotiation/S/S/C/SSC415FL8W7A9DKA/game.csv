"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $120?  That's fair for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.",120.0,Bob,4,
