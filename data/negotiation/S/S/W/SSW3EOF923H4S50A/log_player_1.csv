{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, the risk of losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential gains.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
