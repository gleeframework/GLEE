"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? This way, we can both be happy with the outcome. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still trying to keep my expenses in check. Could we perhaps agree on $100? This would allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget.",100.0,Bob,6,
