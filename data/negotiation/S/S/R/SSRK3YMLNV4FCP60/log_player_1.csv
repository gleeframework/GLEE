Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a high chance of Bob accepting.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Bob's Value:** It is significantly lower than the $1,000,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a substantial potential gain if he accepts.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'm leaving $50,000 on the table compared to a perfect negotiation, there's a good chance Bob will accept, securing a much larger profit than selling to John. 

**Important Note:** This offer assumes a simple negotiation where only price is the factor. In reality, other factors like payment terms, delivery, or exclusivity might influence Bob's decision."
