Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $119 offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially allowing you to earn even more.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is just below your guaranteed sale price, making it more tempting for Bob to accept rather than risk losing the deal."
