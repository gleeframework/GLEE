"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you consider $875,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go any lower than $900,000.  This price still provides a significant benefit for you, and it's the closest I can get to your offer. Let's make this deal happen. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
