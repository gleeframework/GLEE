Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

While $1,050,000 is better, we're still within a reasonable negotiating range. Let's see if we can nudge Alice a bit closer to our ideal price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $1,030,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.

Alice is clearly holding firm, and $1,030,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to accept the deal and secure the product!"
