"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about we settle at $775,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making a deal while acknowledging the value of your product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the price even lower, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  What if we split the difference and land at $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,
