"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $11,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
