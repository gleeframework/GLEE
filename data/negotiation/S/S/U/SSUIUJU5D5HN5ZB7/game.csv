"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the  $1,000,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the returns it can generate.  I'm willing to move down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I'm seeing a gap here between what we both perceive as the product's value. I'm confident this product can significantly impact your operations, justifying a higher investment. I can go as low as $1,550,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
