Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $50,000 in perceived value ($800,000 value to him - $950,000 price) while you gain an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning you'll offer it elsewhere, you introduce a mild sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act sooner rather than later."
