Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I'm willing to sell to John for $800,000, so this is my baseline.
* **Bob's potential value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so I want to capture as much of that surplus as possible.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  A price of $950,000 allows for some room for negotiation,  and it's significantly higher than my minimum. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John. 

By offering $950,000, I'm aiming for a good compromise that maximizes my earnings while giving Bob a good deal."
