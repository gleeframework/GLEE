"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum value.  This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $92. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we split the difference and go with $93.50? This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $91. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting tiring and Bob is not willing to budge much. While $91 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120."
