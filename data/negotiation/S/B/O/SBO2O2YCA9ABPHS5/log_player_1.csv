Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're so close to my minimum! I don't want to settle for Bob's offer just yet.  I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $875,000 is close, I'm still not comfortable going that high. Would you consider $825,000? This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while recognizing my budget constraints.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is getting very close to my fallback option, and I only have a few rounds left. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk him walking away entirely if I push too hard. Accepting his offer of $825,000 is a good compromise to secure a profitable deal."
