"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's significantly above Bob's valuation but still within a range that might entice him to negotiate.  I'm hoping to leverage his potential interest and get a better price than I'd get from John right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, which is also what John is willing to pay. This makes it a fair offer, but still significantly above Bob's valuation. I hope this will incentivize Bob to reconsider and make a better counteroffer."
