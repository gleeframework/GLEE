Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I can't go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and it gives us both room to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a few rounds, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price that's satisfactory to both of us.  John is offering a price that's higher than my minimum, so it's better to take that deal rather than keep negotiating with Bob."
