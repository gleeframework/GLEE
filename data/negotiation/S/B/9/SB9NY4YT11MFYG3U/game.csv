"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, the price is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits this product will bring to your business.",775000.0,Alice,5,
