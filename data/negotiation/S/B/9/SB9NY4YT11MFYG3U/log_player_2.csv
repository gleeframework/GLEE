# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm offering you a discount for being a valued customer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is a fair compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the benefits this product will bring to your business.

It's no longer worth trying to haggle with Alice. John's offer of $800,000 is now better than Alice's $775,000.  It makes sense to cut off negotiations and go with the guaranteed lower price."
