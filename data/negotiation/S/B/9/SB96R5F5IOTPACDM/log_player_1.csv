{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not moving significantly towards my minimum price.  He's increased his offer by $25,000 over two rounds, while I've decreased my ask by $25,000. This indicates he is unlikely to meet my minimum price. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed profit."
