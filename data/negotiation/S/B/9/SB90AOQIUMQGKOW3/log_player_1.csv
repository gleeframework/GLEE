Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when John is offering a guaranteed $1,200,000."
