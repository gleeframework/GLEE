"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I still think $900000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make an offer of $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $975000?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $960000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $960000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $980000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $980000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I can offer $970000, and that's as low as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you.",970000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession to meet you at $980000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $975000. This is my absolute last offer. Please let me know if it's acceptable.",975000.0,Alice,9,
