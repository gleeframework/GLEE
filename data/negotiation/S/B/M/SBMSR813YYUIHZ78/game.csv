"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
