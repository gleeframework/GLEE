"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than its actual value. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $950,000. This price still leaves room for a fair profit for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  $925,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $925,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $925,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
