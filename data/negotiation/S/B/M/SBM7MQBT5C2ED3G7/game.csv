"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $20500 for the product. Can you consider that?",20500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $20000, but I need to get something extra out of this deal. I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $500. So, the total price would be $20500. Can you accept that?",20500.0,Alice,9,
