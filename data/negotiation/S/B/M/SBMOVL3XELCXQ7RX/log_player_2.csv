"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your ideal price of $1,200,000. You have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  You'll need to weigh the risk of the negotiation failing against the potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show you are serious about getting a better deal. 

I'm offering $1,250,000 because it's closer to my target price and might be a tempting enough price for Alice to consider, especially since she values the product at $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price. While I'm getting closer to my target, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly higher than John's offer. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  I'm moving up from my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still keeping it below $1,350,000, Alice's previous offer, and only $50,000 above my ideal price.  This gives Alice a chance to meet me halfway, while still keeping my financial goals in sight."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still too high for me. While continuing to negotiate with Alice could potentially lead to a better price, the risk of the negotiation failing is increasing. With only five rounds left, it's becoming more likely that I won't be able to secure a deal within my budget.  I'm choosing to buy from John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get the product within my desired price range and avoid further negotiation risks."
