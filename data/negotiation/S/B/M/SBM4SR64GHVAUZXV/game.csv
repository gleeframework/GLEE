"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product.  However, $14000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8500. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $9500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
