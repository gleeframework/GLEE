"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not desperate to buy immediately, so I have room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but I still see room for further negotiation.  I'm not in a rush and want to try to secure the lowest possible price.  I'll continue to counter-offer and see if we can reach a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, and I want to make this deal happen. I'm prepared to drop my price to $1,137,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a more than fair reflection of the product's worth.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, and her offer is now within a range I'm comfortable with.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll walk away or I'll run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer gives me a good deal while securing the product."
