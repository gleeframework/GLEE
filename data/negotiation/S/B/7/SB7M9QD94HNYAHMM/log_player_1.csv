It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:** While not the initial asking price, $1,800,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob is firmly anchored at $1,800,000. Further rounds might yield minimal gains and risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays securing the sale. Accepting now provides immediate value."
