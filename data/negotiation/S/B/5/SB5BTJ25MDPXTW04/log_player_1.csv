This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit for me. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further until we reach a mutually agreeable price or choose to sell to John for my desired $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly short of my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's important to secure the deal and guarantee my desired profit."
