Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I think that's fair considering it's well below your asking price, but still demonstrates my strong interest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
