"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $1,200,000, which reflects its value and potential. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I think that's fair considering it's well below your asking price, but still demonstrates my strong interest.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
