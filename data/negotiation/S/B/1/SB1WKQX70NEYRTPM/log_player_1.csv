Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's right in the middle of our last two offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
