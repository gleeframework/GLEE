{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob keeps pushing for a lower price, and with only four rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob."
