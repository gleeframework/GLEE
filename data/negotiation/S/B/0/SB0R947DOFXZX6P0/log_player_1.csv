Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but starting with a high price gives me more leverage. 
* **The ""John"" factor:**  Knowing I have an alternative buyer at $1,200,000 creates a sense of urgency for Bob and allows me to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob. While he's rejected my initial offer, he's still interested in the product. 
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 just doesn't work for me. Considering the value this product offers you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm counteroffering at $850,000, which is significantly closer to Bob's offer than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob, hoping to justify the price.
* **Finding common ground:** I express a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, fostering a collaborative tone. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially reach a deal while ensuring I'm not settling for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Further negotiation needed:** I'm not ready to settle for that price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident I can secure a better offer. 
* **John is my backup:** Having John as an option allows me to push for a higher price without fear of losing the deal entirely. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my ideal range, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $725,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $787,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($850,000) and Bob's latest offer ($725,000). This demonstrates a genuine effort to reach a compromise.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and equity.
* **Closing the deal:** I express a desire to ""finalize the deal,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to consider this offer seriously.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's budget, potentially leading to a successful conclusion of the negotiation."
