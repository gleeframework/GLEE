"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This should encourage him to engage in the process and potentially come up with a counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm not going to be afraid to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it well above Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give the product away. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to settle for $1,150,000. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that is still higher than his last offer, but lower than my previous one. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price.  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. We've got a few rounds left, and I'm not going to settle for anything less than $1,200,000 if possible.  I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a good chunk of profit.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept.  If not, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob's last offer is only $75,000 more than what John is offering.  It's not enough to justify risking another round and potentially ending up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the $1,000,000."
