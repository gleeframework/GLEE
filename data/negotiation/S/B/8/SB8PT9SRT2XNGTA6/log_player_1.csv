"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product has incredible potential and I'm confident in its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential, but I still think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $950,000 is a significant sum, I'm still losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's guaranteed offer.  Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, but I need to hold firm to get closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to see a stronger commitment from your side. Would you consider $980,000 for this unique product?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $980,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $965,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price lower. While $965,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better offer as we're getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to go higher, and even if he doesn't budge much, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's be realistic, we both know this product has substantial value. I'm willing to accept $975,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 975000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is a bit closer to my target. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $955,000 offer.  We are now in round 8, leaving little room for further negotiation. Accepting his offer means losing out on a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
