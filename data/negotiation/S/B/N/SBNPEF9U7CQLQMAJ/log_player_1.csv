"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,750 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter Bob's offer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, I've reached a point where the price is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price.  I've got a guaranteed sale from John at $10,000, so that's the best option for me right now."
