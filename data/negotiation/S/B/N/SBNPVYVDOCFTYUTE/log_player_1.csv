Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $150 asking price is a 25% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This is a significant but not outrageous increase, making it more likely Bob will consider it. 
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down towards your minimum of $120."
