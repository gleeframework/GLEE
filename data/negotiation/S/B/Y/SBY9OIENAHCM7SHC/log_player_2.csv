"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $130 is too high.
* You have a better option with John for $150, but you want to see if you can get a lower price from Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start a negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's new offer of $115 is better than her initial offer but still a bit high.
* You are willing to pay $100, but it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to come down even more.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. You could also choose to go with John for $150 if you feel like you won't be able to get a better price from Alice."
