"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would still be a good deal for both of us, as I value the product at $12,000.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
