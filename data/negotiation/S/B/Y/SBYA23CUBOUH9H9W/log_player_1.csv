I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also provides a buffer in case Bob does not accept and I need to go to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale that's only slightly below my ideal price."
