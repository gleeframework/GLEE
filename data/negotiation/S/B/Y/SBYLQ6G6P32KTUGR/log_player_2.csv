"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $115, but I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $115. Since you can get the product from John for $100, it makes the most financial sense to take that deal."
