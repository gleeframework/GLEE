Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant benefits.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to feel like I'm getting a decent return on my investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept.",10000.0,Alice,5,
