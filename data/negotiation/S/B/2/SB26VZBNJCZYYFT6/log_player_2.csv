"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to let it go for $7,000? "", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price of $8,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $550 compared to buying from John."
