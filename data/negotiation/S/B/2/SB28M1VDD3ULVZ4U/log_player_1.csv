Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate, but I'll also be keeping an eye on John's offer in case things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a good price, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or ending up with John's lower offer."
