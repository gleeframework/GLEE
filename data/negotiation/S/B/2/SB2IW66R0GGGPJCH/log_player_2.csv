Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer.  John's offer saves $500 which is a guaranteed win at this point."
