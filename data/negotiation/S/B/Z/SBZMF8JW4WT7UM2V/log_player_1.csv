Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,500."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob.  
* **Highlight Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, rather than just the price.

This approach aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price below its perceived value to him, and Alice maximizes her profit. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the safety net of selling to John at her minimum desired price."
