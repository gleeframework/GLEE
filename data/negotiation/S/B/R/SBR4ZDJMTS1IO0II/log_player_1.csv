{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It allows for negotiation:** This price leaves room for both of you to negotiate. You can either accept a counteroffer from Bob, or make a counter-counteroffer if needed. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's,  it's still lower than the price you initially offered.  There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your target price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find this is a great deal, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It's a compromise:** It meets Bob halfway between your previous offer and his offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're not giving up your minimum price of $12,000, ensuring you'll still make a profit.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can still negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your target.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John if you feel the negotiations with Bob aren't going in your favor."
