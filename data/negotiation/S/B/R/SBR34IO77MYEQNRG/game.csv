"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this represents a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000.
