```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts. Considering the value of the product, I think $86 would be a fair price. Let's aim for this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $86. Although it's not the $90 I was aiming for, it's still better than selling to John for $80.  It's a good price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate."
