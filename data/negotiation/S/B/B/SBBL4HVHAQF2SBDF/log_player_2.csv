"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $80, there is no benefit to accepting her offer. You're better off rejecting her offer and buying the product from John for the same price."
