"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1500000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
