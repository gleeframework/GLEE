Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further before buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $800000, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but I'm not sure if we can negotiate further. It's probably best to buy from John at this point to avoid further negotiation and ensure a purchase within my budget."
