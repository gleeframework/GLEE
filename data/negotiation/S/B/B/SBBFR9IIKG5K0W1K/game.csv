"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15000 might be a bit high, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value I see in the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
