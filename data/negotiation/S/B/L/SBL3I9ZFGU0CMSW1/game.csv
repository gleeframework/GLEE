"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9000 is closer, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. Would you be willing to consider $9500? It's a compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8800 is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to consider $9200?  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's find a way to make this work!",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and I want to make this work. However, $8500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and meet at $8750.  This would give us both a good outcome and allow us to close this deal. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $8750 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8250?",8250.0,Bob,8,
