,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $160, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $140.  Let's find a way to make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $155, and that's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
