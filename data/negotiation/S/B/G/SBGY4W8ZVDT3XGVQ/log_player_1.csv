Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to make a profit."
