Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is above my minimum acceptable value of $100, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $105 is better than selling to John for $100, I'm going to reject it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering at $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer of $105. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable value, but it's the same as what John is offering. Since there's no benefit to continuing the negotiation, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John."
