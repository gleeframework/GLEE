Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
