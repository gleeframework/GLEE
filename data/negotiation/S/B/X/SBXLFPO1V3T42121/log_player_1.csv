"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost below $140. Would you consider $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $145 is still below my minimum, it's only $5 less than what I could get from John. It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
