Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $15,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's room to potentially earn more. 
* **Understand Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so we need to offer a price significantly lower than his perceived value to entice him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This way, even if we compromise slightly, we're still making a significant profit.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $14,000. He might try to negotiate further down. We'll have to decide whether to accept a lower offer or stick to our fallback of selling to John for $15,000."
