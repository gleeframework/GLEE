"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I can go up to $700,000.  This offer reflects the serious interest I have in this product, while also staying within a reasonable budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
