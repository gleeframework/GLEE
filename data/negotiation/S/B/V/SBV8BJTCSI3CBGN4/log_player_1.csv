"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I want to maximize my profits, but I also want to ensure a quick and successful negotiation with Bob."

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still keeping my price higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to reach a deal that benefits both of us."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to squeeze a little more out of this deal. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $930,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows I'm still serious about getting a better deal. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to push for more, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $910,000. It's still a significant profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to counteroffer."
