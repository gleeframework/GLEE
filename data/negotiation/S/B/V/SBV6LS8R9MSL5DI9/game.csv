"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $110 is quite a bit lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This still gives me a profit and hopefully it's a price you're comfortable with. Let's see if we can close the deal.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  To make this work for me, could you do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!",132.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close.  I'm willing to meet in the middle at $128 if that works for you?",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we compromise at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep a reasonable profit margin.  Let's make this deal happen!",130.0,Alice,7,
