Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $110 as it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer, $110 is quite a bit lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This still gives me a profit and hopefully it's a price you're comfortable with. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

Round 4

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
