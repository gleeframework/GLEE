"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe is worth more than $10000 to us. Given the value it holds, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to consider a price of $14000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $14000, which would be $13250. Can we consider that price?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to agree on a price of $13500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering both our positions.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can we consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I am willing to agree on a price of $13200 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise given our discussions so far.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to explore other options.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Bob. After further consideration, I am willing to agree on a price of $12900 for the product. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us.",12900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $12900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $12500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,10,
