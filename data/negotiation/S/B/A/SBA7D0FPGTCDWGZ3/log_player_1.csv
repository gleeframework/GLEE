Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise. It also reflects that the product is worth more than $100 to me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $100.  While I'd like to get closer to my target, I'm not willing to sell for that low.  I'm going to counter with a new price and see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105.  This is a compromise that's still above my minimum threshold but shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below the $100 I can get from John.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
