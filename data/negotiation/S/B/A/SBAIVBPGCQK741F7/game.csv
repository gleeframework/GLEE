"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product.  I believe it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm starting with an offer of $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. I'm happy to negotiate further, but I'm proposing a price of $1350000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my financial situation, I am still not able to meet the price of $1350000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this proposal is more within your consideration.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
