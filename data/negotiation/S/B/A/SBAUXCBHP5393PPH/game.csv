"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your operations. My asking price is $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential for your business. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my budget?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'm offering the product for $900,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet you at $900,000. I would like to propose $850,000 as a compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
