"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. How about $8,500?  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's a competitive price that reflects the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $9,000.  How about we split the difference at $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps us both happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,
