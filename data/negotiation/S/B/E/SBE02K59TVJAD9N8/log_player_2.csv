Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table.

Bob should choose to buy from John. He's only 500 dollars away from his goal and there's a high chance that Alice won't accept his counteroffer in the final round.  It's a better choice to secure the product from John for a price that's within his budget."
