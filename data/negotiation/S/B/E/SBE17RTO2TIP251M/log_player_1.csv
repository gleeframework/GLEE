"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Aggressive Approach:**  Since I have a backup buyer (John), I can afford to be more aggressive initially. 
* **Bob's Value:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, it's likely he'll be willing to pay more to secure it, especially if he sees the value in it.

**Strategy:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price slightly, but I'll also factor in how many rounds remain. If the negotiation drags on, I might be better off selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and even lower than what it's worth to him.  There's no reason to accept it at this point.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on a higher price just yet.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,000,000, I want to see if I can potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, to show flexibility while maintaining a good position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still remaining above Bob's initial offer.
* **Strategic Reduction:** The price reduction is substantial enough to signal seriousness, but it doesn't give away too much ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's value for the product, and I believe he might be willing to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to monitor Bob's reactions and adjust my offers accordingly, but I'm keeping a close eye on the number of rounds remaining. If the negotiation stalls or it becomes clear that I can't get closer to my desired price, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe I can get.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We are making progress, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price with more rounds remaining. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John is tempting, I'm determined to see if I can achieve a better outcome through negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but I'll still be aiming for a figure closer to my minimum value. I'll factor in the number of rounds remaining and adjust my offers strategically. I'm prepared to sell to John if it becomes evident that I cannot achieve a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer represents a significant compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.
* **Minimum Value:**  This price is my absolute minimum, and I'm willing to accept it since I have a backup buyer.
* **Closing the Deal:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I want to signal that I'm serious about finalizing a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I will likely accept his next counteroffer if it's close to my minimum value, as I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price. However, I'll still be mindful of the remaining rounds and adjust my strategy if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I risk losing a good deal if I continue to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, there's a chance I might lose out on a higher price if Bob increases his offer in the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale close to my minimum value.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
