Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is simple and explains the value proposition to Bob.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $80, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92.50 is not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly higher than selling to John for $80.  It's also a good indication that Bob is serious about buying the product."
