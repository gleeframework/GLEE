"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. This allows for a mutually beneficial deal while still giving you a significant return on your investment. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a lower price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit while giving you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise that allows for a fair profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
