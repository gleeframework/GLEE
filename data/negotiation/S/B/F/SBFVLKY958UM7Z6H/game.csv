"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000. I'm confident this product can bring you considerable value, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
