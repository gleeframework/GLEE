"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To kick things off, I'd like to offer it to you for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:**  The high starting price acknowledges that this is just the first step in a potentially multi-round negotiation. I anticipate counteroffers and am prepared to adjust my price strategically. 
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially increase his willingness to pay a higher price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while remaining aware that I have the security of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but accepting this offer would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. 

By rejecting and countering, I can try to steer the negotiation towards a price point that works better for me while still engaging with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000. I'm confident this product can bring you considerable value, and I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Holding Ground (for now):**  My new offer is still substantially above Bob's,  but it leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value and Collaboration:**  By reiterating the product's value and expressing openness to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm aiming to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could become protracted. Accepting this offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
