Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, recognizing the value this product brings.  It's still a great price for the potential it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1750000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1625000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more,  $1,625,000 is a good price, and it's worth closing the deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for the minimum."
