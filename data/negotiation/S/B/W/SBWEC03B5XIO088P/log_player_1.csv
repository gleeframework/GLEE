{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also being friendly and engaging to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $120 is a fair price for it. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John. I'd rather sell to Bob since we've been negotiating and it seems like he's genuinely interested."
