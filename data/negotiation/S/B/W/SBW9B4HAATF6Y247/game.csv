"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it,  given my own financial constraints. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $850000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring, I'm willing to meet you at $920000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $920000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $875000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $875000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. Considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations, I'm willing to meet you at $915000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.
