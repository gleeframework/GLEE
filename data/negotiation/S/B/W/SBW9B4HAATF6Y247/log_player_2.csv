Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $875000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we are already in round 7.

It's better to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
