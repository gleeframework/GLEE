"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't meet you at $1,200,000. My maximum budget for this product is $800,000. Could we find a middle ground?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe $800,000 is a reasonable price. Could we perhaps negotiate closer to this amount? I'm open to discussing further.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to increase my budget to $900,000. Is this within your range to make the deal happen?",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $975,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's make this deal happen.  Time is running out.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Please let me know if this works for you.",925000.0,Bob,8,
