"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. How about we settle at $9,250? That feels like a fair compromise.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9,250 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $10,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a product of this value, and I think you'll love it!",10000.0,Alice,5,
