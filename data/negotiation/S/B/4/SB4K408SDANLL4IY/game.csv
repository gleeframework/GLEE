,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $12000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $15000? I'm open to a little negotiation, but I can't go much lower.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13500 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $14000? This is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this is my final offer.  $13750. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",13750.0,Alice,7,
