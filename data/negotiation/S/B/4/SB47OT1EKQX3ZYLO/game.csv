"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is significantly below my bottom line. I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $12,500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
