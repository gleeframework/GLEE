{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,100,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still above your minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring you don't lose out.
* **It's a reasonable offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response and the need to secure a deal quickly if you feel John might be a more viable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While you're open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for you. It's better to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to your desired price:** $1,050,000 is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Message emphasizes fairness:** The message acknowledges Bob's desire for a good deal but also emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of your counteroffer. 
* **Focus on finding common ground:**  The message ends with a positive note, suggesting a willingness to continue negotiating and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below your ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offer. It's close enough to your desired range that accepting it is likely the best strategy. Here's why:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  While not ideal, it represents a reasonable compromise and a good step towards a deal.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continued negotiation could drag out the process, potentially jeopardizing your opportunity to sell to John.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price or a failed deal. 

While $1,200,000 would be ideal,  $1,025,000 is a solid outcome and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
