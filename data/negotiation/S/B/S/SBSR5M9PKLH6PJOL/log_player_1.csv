Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your operations. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,300,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to encourage him to see it as a good investment.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating that I'm willing to find a ""fair price,"" I'm signaling flexibility and inviting Bob to counter. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counter-offer based on his response, and I always have the option to fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This product is valuable, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested.  This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity to Increase Price:** I can use my counteroffer to try and push the price closer to my desired range.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I retain control of the negotiation and have the opportunity to improve the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm confident the product is worth more, I'm willing to be flexible. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to accept $1,200,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see the price as fair.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** By saying ""I'm prepared to accept,"" I'm signaling a willingness to come down but not to go lower than my minimum. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while still maximizing my potential earnings. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my next counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to switch to John's offer if necessary."
