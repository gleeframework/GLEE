"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and should encourage her to negotiate further. This leaves room for a compromise and allows Bob to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still more than what Bob would like to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer and counteroffering is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate and is pushing for a lower price. This counteroffer is a reasonable increase from his previous offer, showing a commitment to reach a deal while still aiming for a good price.  It is likely to encourage Alice to make further concessions in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial price and much lower than what Bob would pay John. While there's still some room for negotiation, accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or a higher price."
