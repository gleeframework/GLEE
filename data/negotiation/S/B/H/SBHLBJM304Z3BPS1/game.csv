"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment.  Would you consider $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate the value, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to myself on this deal.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.",11000.0,Bob,6,
