"Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product! I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about $95?  It's closer to my initial offer and I think we can both agree on a fair deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
