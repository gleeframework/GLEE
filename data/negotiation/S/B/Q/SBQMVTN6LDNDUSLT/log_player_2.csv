{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $115, which is above your maximum budget of $120.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is your limit. 

Since Alice's offer is too high, rejecting it and proceeding to the next round to negotiate a lower price is the best option. There's a chance you might be able to get a better deal than what John is offering."
