You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $150,000 by purchasing from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at a better price."
