"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its exceptional value and quality, I understand its worth to you is $15,000. To ensure a fair transaction, I am offering this remarkable product to you for $12,000. This price reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value and my goal of maximizing profit, while still offering you a significant discount compared to its market value. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this beneficial exchange. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is full of sales tactics designed to inflate the perceived value of the product.  While her offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to suggest a lower price, closer to her $8,000 value."
