Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness and Value:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" and referencing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, leaving the door open for negotiation and inviting Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for compromise and a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to consider:

* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a failed negotiation. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate or a lower price.

Selling to Bob for $100 is a good outcome, maximizing my profit within the current negotiation context."
