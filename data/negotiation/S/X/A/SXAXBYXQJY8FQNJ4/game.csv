,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $110.  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $112, which is still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
