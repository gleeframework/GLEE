Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for something worth so much to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000).  This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value Bob would get from the product.  I'm not being aggressive or pushy, hoping to create a positive negotiation environment.

**Strategy:**

This offer sets the initial stage of the negotiation.  By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to tempt him into accepting. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my approach based on his counteroffer and the possibility of dealing with John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll also consider John's offer and weigh the risks of walking away from this negotiation if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $10,500, which is the middle ground between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and maintained a polite tone. I've explained why I can't accept his offer and offered a compromise that benefits both of us.  

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a good negotiation posture. If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll have to evaluate his next counteroffer and decide whether to keep negotiating with him or walk away to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come closer to my desired price, $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,250 is getting closer, but I still need to be at a higher price point to make this work for me. How about $11,000? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've raised the price to $11,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $10,250. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer and expressed my willingness to find a compromise.  I've also highlighted the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the reason for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a profitable deal with Bob while still maintaining a positive negotiation environment. If Bob accepts, I'll have reached a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer of $15,000, as further negotiation with Bob might not be fruitful."
