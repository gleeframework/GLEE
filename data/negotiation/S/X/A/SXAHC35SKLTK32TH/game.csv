"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $10250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10250 is getting closer, but I still need to be at a higher price point to make this work for me. How about $11000? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
