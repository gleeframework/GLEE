{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By stating a price and asking for his opinion, you open the door for a conversation and potential counteroffers. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $90 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll do $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $120 asking price, $92.50 is a decent compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still gets me a reasonable profit. Accepting Bob's offer is the best decision at this point."
