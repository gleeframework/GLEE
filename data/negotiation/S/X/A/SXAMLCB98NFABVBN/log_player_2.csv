Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more realistic number. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. To be frank,  $850,000 is just too low for me to consider.  Let's find a solution – I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we do need to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to make a substantial move to get this deal done. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a big concession, and I need to see you move closer to that figure as well to make this work.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  Let's be direct – I can close this deal right now for $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.  It reflects a fair deal given the product's value.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, but I need to move forward quickly with another buyer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price well above your $1,000,000 limit. Her ""final offer"" language suggests she's unlikely to move much further. While you *might* be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the last round, it's too risky. You have a guaranteed option with John at your maximum price."
