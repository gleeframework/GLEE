"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a price I believe reflects the true value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase the price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
