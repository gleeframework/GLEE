"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $135 for it. This price not only reflects the product's worth but also allows us to maintain a fair transaction. I trust you'll find it a reasonable offer considering the benefits you stand to gain. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to her value, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $120.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John is the most financially sound decision."
