"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $12,000 it's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, saving him $1,500."
