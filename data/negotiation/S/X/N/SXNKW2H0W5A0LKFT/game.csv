"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I do think it's a good product, $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $7,500 is a fair price, considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. That's the lowest I can go.",10000.0,Alice,5,
