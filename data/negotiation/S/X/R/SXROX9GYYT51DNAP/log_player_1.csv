Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $2,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that captures as much of that potential profit as possible without driving Bob away.  A price too close to $12,000 might make him balk, while a price too close to $10,000 leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's short, professional, and hints at the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:**  $11,500 is a strong opening offer. It gives you a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($500 less than his perceived value).

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Don't Reveal Your Minimum:** Never tell Bob you have another buyer at $10,000. This weakens your position."
