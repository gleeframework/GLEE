"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget, there's potential to negotiate further and get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price. This is a bold move to signal his intention to negotiate aggressively and potentially get a better price.  By offering $10,500, Bob is testing the waters, seeing how much Alice is willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is still within Bob's budget, it's still higher than he'd like to pay. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice's offer isn't very far from his initial counteroffer. There's still room to push for a better price, so Bob should reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but he is still willing to negotiate.  This is a compromise from his previous offer, but he believes it's still a good price, especially considering Alice's initial asking price.  He hopes this counteroffer will convince Alice to come closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still too high.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee. Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice's counteroffers are not significantly different from her initial price.  The risk of getting a better deal is not worth the potential for further negotiation.  At this point, buying from John for $15,000 is the most rational decision.  It guarantees Bob the product within his budget, while saving him the time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
