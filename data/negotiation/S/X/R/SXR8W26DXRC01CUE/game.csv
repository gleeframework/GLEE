"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, given its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? It's a fair offer considering its benefits.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget. However, $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its worth. I can go as low as $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500, but that's the absolute limit for me.",12500.0,Bob,6,
