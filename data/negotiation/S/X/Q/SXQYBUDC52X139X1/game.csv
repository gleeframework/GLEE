"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is still too low for me. Would you consider $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $15,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
