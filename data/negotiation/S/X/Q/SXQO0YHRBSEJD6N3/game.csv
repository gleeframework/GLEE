"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you a substantial profit margin. Let me know your thoughts!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay that much.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is definitely lower than my initial asking price, it's still far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price that reflects the value of what I'm offering. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This gives you a good deal, while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a profit, but $1,300,000 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still below my bottom line. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're willing to agree.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
