{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also less than the price John is offering.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option, as it allows you to save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
