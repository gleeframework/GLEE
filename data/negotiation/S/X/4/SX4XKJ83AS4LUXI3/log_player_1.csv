"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to me, but still allows you to make a good profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a better starting point.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer of $15,000, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to compromise shows that he's interested in the product.
* **Value to Bob:** While I won't go down to $9,000, I can offer a counteroffer that's still a good deal for Bob, but closer to my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and can potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering you value the product at $8,000, and it's closer to the price I need to make this work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out financially. 
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product and highlighting the fact that $10,500 is a good deal for him.
* **Time is Ticking:**  I'm starting to consider the time constraint of 10 rounds, so I'm pushing for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I believe there's still potential for a better deal.  Bob's willingness to increase his offer shows that he's genuinely interested.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially get a higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm mindful of the time constraint, but I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down to $10,000, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product and framing $10,000 as a fair deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware that we have limited rounds left, and I want to close the deal without resorting to selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is inching closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, time is running out. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially get a higher price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,750. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. To make this work, I need to stay at $10,250.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining Value:**  $10,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm reminding Bob that the offer is still a good deal for him, considering his perceived value of the product. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that John's offer is a better deal for me, but I'm still trying to close a deal with Bob.  If the negotiation fails, I have a backup option."

* **Minimizing Risk:**  It's safer to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk losing both deals and ending up with nothing."
