"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $10,500? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to meet my minimum requirements.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,4,
