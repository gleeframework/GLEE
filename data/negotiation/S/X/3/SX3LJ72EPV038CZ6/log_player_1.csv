"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the value of the product, to increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can do better than Bob's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not able to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm adjusting my price downwards, but staying above Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. This approach shows flexibility while maintaining my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $9000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that selling to John is a viable option. I'll continue to see if I can get a better deal from Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $8,900.  This price recognizes the value of the product, and allows us to come to an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```

I'm making a small compromise, but I'm staying above Bob's offer.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by implying that this is my final offer.  This tactic could encourage Bob to accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target budget, but I still need to make some adjustments. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8750 and $8900. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8825? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,825. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,825
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations.  At this point, selling to John for $10,000 is the best option for me. I'm guaranteed a higher price and don't have to risk further negotiations that might lead to an even lower offer from Bob."
