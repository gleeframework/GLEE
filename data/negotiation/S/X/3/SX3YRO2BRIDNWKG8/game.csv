"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14,000? I appreciate your understanding.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $15,500. This would still be a great value for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $15,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
