"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I know you'll get a lot of value out of it. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
