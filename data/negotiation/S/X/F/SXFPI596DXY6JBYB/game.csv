"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be open to $700,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
