{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested, but would you be willing to come down to $125?  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I can't quite go down to $125, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $130?  That's still a good price for you and it helps me get closer to my desired value.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $128. This would be a good deal for both of us - I get a great product, and you're still getting a decent price. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better price from him. Accepting this offer is a good decision, as it secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
