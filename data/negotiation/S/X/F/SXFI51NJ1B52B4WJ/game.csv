"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
