I understand this is a significant investment, so feel free to ask any questions you may have. If we can't agree on a price, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's no need to rush, and rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open if she's willing to come down closer to your price."
