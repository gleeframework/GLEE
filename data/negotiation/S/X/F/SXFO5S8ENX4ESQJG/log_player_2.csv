"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. While I see the value in your product, I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $1200000? This would give you a significant value for the product and still allow me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $1300000 to make this worthwhile. This is a significant investment for you, and the product's value will only increase over time. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you have already rejected her previous offer. It is becoming clear that you are unlikely to reach an agreement with Alice within your budget.  It's best to cut your losses and buy from John, ensuring you get the product for a price you can afford."
