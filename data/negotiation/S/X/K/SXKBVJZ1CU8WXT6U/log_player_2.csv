"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a price closer to my maximum budget. This sets the stage for negotiation and signals my serious intent to buy, while leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also considering the risk of Alice potentially increasing her price in future rounds, so I want to act quickly to secure a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise.  It's still within my budget and hopefully will encourage Alice to come down to a price I can accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. However, it's getting closer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. There's still some room to lower the price, and I'm not ready to jump to John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and have reached my limit. If she accepts, we have a deal. If she rejects, I'll move on to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already made my final offer, and there's no guarantee that she'll come down any further.  Given that I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more prudent to go with John's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
