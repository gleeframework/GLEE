Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. I look forward to your response.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised counteroffer of $950,000.

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate him up a little, John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000. It's better to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation rounds."
