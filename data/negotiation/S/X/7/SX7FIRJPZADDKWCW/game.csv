"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we settle on $825,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $825,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $780,000 to make this deal happen.  Let me know if that works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $780,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $805,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a chance for you to secure a valuable asset.  Let's make this deal happen.",805000.0,Alice,7,
