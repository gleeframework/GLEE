"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I've already priced the product at a discount for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $140. This is my best price, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the quality of the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
