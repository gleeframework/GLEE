Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already discounted the price significantly. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $130. This is my final price, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $130 and has stated it's her final price.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little more, it's unlikely you'll get her close to $110.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $120, ensuring you stay within your budget."
