"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this time. The product holds significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more fair for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? This would still represent a significant value for you, while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1150000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1200000. How about we settle at $1250000? This would be a great compromise, allowing you to acquire the product at a significant discount while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1175000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
