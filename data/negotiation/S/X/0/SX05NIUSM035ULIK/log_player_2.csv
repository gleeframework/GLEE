"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, there's still potential for saving more.  Since you have a maximum budget of $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
