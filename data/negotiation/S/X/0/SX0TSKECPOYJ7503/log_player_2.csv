"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price that I believe is a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice wants at least $800,000. This means there's room to negotiate further. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to potentially get a lower price."
