Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

**Here's my strategy:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  A higher opening price gives me more room to negotiate.  
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The offer is still lower than my minimum, allowing for a potential middle ground. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy.  If he's willing to negotiate, I'll be prepared to lower my price gradually. However, I'll always keep my minimum acceptable price in mind and have the option to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much.  

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range, but still offering some room for negotiation.  I'm prepared to keep negotiating with Bob if necessary, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above his initial counteroffer.  

**Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Value:**  By lowering the price to $1,250,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise and meet Bob halfway. This makes it more likely that he'll accept the offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Creating Pressure:** By offering a lower price, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to accept. He knows that if he rejects this offer, he might risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to continue negotiating with him.  I'll be ready to adjust my price slightly lower if needed, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a price that's so far below my value.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range, but still offering some room for negotiation. I'm prepared to keep negotiating with Bob if necessary, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,150,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still above his last offer of $1,100,000.  

**Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** By offering $1,150,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise and meet Bob almost halfway between his last offer and my previous offer. This makes it more likely that he'll accept the offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Final Push:** By offering a slightly lower price, I'm putting some pressure on Bob to accept. He knows that if he rejects this offer, he might risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether, and I might decide to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a decent deal. If he rejects it, I'll strongly consider selling to John for $1,500,000. The negotiation has gone on for a while, and I'm not sure if I want to continue negotiating with Bob if he's not willing to meet me closer to my desired price."
