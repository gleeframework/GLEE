Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can still do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will give me a better chance of achieving a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a fair price considering the value Bob will get from the product. This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while maintaining a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much more room there is for negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's better to accept Bob's offer now and secure a sale than risk further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a rejection that forces me to sell to John at a lower price."
