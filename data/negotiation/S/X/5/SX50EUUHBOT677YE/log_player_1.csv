Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you will list the product publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now. This can encourage a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price, you are not at risk of losing money."
