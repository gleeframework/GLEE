"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to explore options, and since you have a ""backup"" option with John at $12,000, there's no harm in seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved a little, but it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for further negotiation, and since you have the backup option with John, it makes sense to see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $11,250, which is within your budget and a significant reduction from her initial offer. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and the possibility of running out of rounds before reaching a deal with John make accepting this offer the most logical choice."
