Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my desired profit than John's offer. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for negotiation and counteroffers, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. 
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm not explicitly stating a deadline, but the mention of John creates a sense of urgency."
