# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm getting closer to just buying from John."

Alice's offer is still too high. At this point, it's more worthwhile to buy from John and save myself the extra $200,000."
