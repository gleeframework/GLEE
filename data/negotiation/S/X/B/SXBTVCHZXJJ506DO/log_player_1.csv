Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15,000 asking price represents a 50% markup, which is significant but not outrageous. It leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Early Bird Incentive:** Highlighting that Bob has a chance to buy before a public listing adds a sense of exclusivity and might make him more inclined to accept a higher price."
