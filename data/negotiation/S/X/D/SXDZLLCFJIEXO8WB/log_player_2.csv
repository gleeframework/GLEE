"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000). It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the value of the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1020000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the item.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,020,000 is getting closer to my desired price. However, I still see room for improvement.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to $1,050,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm proposing a price of $1030000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,035,000.  While I would still prefer to pay slightly less, I believe it's likely that further negotiation would be very difficult, and we'd be going back and forth for a while.  It's not worth the risk of her walking away and me having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
