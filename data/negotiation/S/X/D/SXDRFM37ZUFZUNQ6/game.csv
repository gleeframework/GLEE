"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this work. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while giving you a great product.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $9,000. I really think this product would be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
