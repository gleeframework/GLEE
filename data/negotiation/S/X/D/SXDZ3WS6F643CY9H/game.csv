"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1000000, which I believe is a fair price considering your valuation and my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This price takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is still outside my ideal range.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000. This is a significant step closer to your desired price while staying within my budget. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1200000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
