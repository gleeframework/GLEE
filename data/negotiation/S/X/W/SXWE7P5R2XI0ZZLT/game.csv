"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value the product can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit too far apart though.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a very good deal for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
