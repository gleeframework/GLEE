"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will greatly benefit your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the value the product can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. There are still rounds left, and I haven't exhausted my options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit too far apart though.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a very good deal for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to my desired price, $9,250 is still above my budget. I've only got 5 rounds left, and it doesn't seem like I'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $9,000.  I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000."
