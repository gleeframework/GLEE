"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal.  I have 9 rounds left, which gives me ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work.  It's a fair compromise and still leaves a good margin for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9,800. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and provides a good value for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price reductions and the potential for a drawn-out process makes it more appealing to accept John's offer of $10,000. This ensures a quick sale and guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
