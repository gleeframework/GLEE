{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to make a profit of $8,000, which is significant considering my minimum value for the product.  I've offered a price that is appealing to Bob but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired value of $12,000. I will reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum value for the product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with $10,000 for the product. This price aligns more closely with its value to me and remains within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $12,000,  $10,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a fair deal for both of us and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to Bob rejecting my offer again."
