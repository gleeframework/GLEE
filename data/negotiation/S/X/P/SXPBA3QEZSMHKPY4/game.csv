"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This still gives you a good value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, and I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,410,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,411,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1411250.0,Alice,7,
