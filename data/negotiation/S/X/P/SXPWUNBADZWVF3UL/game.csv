"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for a high-quality item like this.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'd like to propose a price of $16500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,5,
