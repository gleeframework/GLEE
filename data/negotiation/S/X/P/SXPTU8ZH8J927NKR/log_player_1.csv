Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for Above Bob's Value:** Offering it slightly below your absolute minimum ($15,000) wouldn't make sense. Bob values it at $10,000, so aiming for a price between $10,000 and $19,000 maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics beyond his valuation of the product."
