"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is my highest offer so far, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly unique and rare.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.  What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and what I've seen so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is not budging much on his offer. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to the $1,500,000 John is offering. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,300,000 would mean a $200,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer."
