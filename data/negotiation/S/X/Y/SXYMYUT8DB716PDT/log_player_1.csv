Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** Bob values the product at $800,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more. There's a chance he perceives even greater value in it.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The high price provides a cushion for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can lower the price while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your guaranteed $800,000.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
