Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is more than your minimum price of $80.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $100 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly less than what you could get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.
