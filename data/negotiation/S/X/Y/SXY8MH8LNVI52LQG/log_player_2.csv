"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

 Alice's starting offer is overpriced. There's room to negotiate a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $100 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Alice.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A counteroffer this low signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it allows space for further negotiation if Alice rejects it.
* **Strategic positioning:** By starting low, I aim to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range, increasing the chances of a final agreement below $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $85 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and a reasonable price compared to my maximum budget of $120. 
* **Limited time:** Continuous back-and-forth might not yield a significantly better outcome and could risk Alice losing interest in negotiating.
* **John's offer:** While I could try for a slightly lower price, risking John's $120 offer isn't worth the potential savings at this point."
