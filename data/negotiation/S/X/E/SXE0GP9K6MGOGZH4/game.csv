"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable going below $120. This would still be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",120.0,Alice,5,
