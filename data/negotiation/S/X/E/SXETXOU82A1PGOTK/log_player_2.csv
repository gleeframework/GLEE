"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $18000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000. It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little room to move on my end. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000.  It's better to continue negotiating, as there's still room for a lower price.  Bob can counteroffer again and see if Alice will come down further.  However, he should also keep in mind that he can always buy the product from John for $12,000 if he feels negotiations with Alice are getting too complicated or aren't yielding results."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $14000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with. I'm confident that this product is worth more than $13000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. However, it is closer than previous offers, indicating that Alice is becoming more flexible. Bob should continue negotiating, as there is still room for a lower price. If he continues to reject offers, he might be able to get a better price. However, he should also keep in mind that he can always buy the product from John for $12,000 if he feels negotiations with Alice are getting too complicated or aren't yielding results."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is the absolute highest I can offer. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
