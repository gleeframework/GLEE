"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, the price you proposed is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,5,
