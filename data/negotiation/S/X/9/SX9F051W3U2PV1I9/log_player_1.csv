Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,025,000. Can you reconsider?

Bob is very close to John's offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether. Accepting $1,025,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
