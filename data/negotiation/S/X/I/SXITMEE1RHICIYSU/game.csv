"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a good price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a counteroffer closer to $1,400,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
