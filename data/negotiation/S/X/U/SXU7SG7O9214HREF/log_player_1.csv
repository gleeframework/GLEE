I'm starting high, aiming for my full valuation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if he's willing to pay top dollar first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to settle for that much less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on a significant profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
