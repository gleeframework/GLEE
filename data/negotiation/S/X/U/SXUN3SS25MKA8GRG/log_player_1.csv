Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating Bob would be overpaying.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency, prompting Bob to decide quickly before losing the opportunity.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") leaving space open for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

While Alice knows she has John as a backup, she doesn't reveal this information.  Her goal is to maximize her profit with Bob, and revealing her guaranteed sale could weaken her negotiating position."
