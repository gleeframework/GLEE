Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
