"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
