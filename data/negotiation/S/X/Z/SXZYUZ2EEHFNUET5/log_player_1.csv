Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for return."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential return,"" I'm framing the high price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I'm aware that I have a backup offer from John. This gives me leverage and a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is a significant jump down, indicating potential for further negotiation.
* While $950,000 is a good profit, I'm aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows us both to move closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm signaling flexibility by coming down from my initial offer while still aiming high.
* **Incremental Steps:** A $100,000 decrease is substantial but keeps the negotiation moving without giving away too much ground.
* **Positive Language:**  By using phrases like ""move closer to an agreement,"" I maintain a collaborative and optimistic tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and a good compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small increments and risk Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the profit."
