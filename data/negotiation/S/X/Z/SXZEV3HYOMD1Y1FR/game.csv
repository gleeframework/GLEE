"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  Let's meet in the middle.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $85? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $85 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $78. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",78.0,Bob,6,
