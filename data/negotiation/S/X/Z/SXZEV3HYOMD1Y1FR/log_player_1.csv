"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This is to create room for negotiation and hopefully get closer to the value I assign to the product.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $90, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and reaffirm my desire to reach an agreement. I'm also suggesting a ""middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I'm going to try to get a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $85? That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's latest offer of $75. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the idea of compromise and fairness to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 

I'm hoping this offer is more enticing to Bob and we can finally close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $85 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $78. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's getting closer. I've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's important to consider that I could sell to John for $100, but Bob's offer is close enough that I'm willing to accept it. There's a risk that I might get a better offer in the next round, but it's also possible that the negotiations will fall apart, and I'll end up selling to John. Considering the risk-reward, I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
