Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and create a sense of scarcity.
* **Open Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, the message encourages a dialogue and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging that there's a guaranteed backup offer from John at the product's minimum value to Alice."
