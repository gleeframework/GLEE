"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since I'm looking for a product worth no more than $150, and John is selling it for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. I can get the product immediately from John."
