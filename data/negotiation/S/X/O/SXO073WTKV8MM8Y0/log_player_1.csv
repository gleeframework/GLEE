Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
