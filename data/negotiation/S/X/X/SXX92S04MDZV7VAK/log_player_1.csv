"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I can potentially get more from Bob. I will counteroffer to maintain negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,500.  This price is still fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there.  How about $13,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now above my minimum threshold of $12,000. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While I could potentially get a higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or deciding to walk away is increasing. It's better to secure the deal now at a price that is acceptable to me."
