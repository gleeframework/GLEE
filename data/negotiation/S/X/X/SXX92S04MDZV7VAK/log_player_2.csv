"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $13,500.  This price is still fair for both of us and allows us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save more. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue haggling and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there.  How about $13,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price.  $13,000 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying but wants to get as close to his target price as possible.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward."
