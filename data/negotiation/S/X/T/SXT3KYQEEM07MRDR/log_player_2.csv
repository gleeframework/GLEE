# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than the price Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000).  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $100,000."
