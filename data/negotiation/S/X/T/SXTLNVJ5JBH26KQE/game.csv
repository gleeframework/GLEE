"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand the market, $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product has the potential to bring significant value to your business.",1675000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,625,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000 is too high, but $1,625,000 is a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $1,612,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and my budget.",1612500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I respect that. However, $1,612,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,650,000, meeting you halfway on our last offers. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your business.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $1,635,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000.",1635000.0,Bob,10,
