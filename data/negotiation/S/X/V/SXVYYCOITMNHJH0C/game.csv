"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  To continue our conversation, I'd like to counter with $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
