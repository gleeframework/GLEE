Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your final offer. I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to go above his final offer of $135.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed $150 from John."
