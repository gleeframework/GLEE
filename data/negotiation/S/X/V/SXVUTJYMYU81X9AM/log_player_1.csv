Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's also significantly more than Bob's perceived value, so he'll be motivated to bargain. I'm confident John's offer of $1,500,000 is a good safety net if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price. While John is a safety net, I want to see if I can get closer to my target with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to compromise further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher. I'm still confident that John's offer is a solid fallback option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering $1,550,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating a commitment to reaching a deal. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the negotiation process."
