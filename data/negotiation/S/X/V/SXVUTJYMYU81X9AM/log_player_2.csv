"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's price is still above your maximum, and you've already made two counteroffers.  There's a risk that Alice will continue to reject your offers, and the negotiation will drag on.  It's time to secure the product at a known price from John."
