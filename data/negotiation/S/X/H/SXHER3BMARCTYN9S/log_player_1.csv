Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This is a unique chance to acquire it before I explore other offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still representing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other offers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the deal seriously. 

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher sale price."
