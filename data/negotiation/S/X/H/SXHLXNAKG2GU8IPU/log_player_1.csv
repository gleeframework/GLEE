Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $20,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $14,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 is a good strategic move at this point:

* **Profitable:**  It's above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and a solid profit over my minimum ($15,000).
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me missing out on other opportunities. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get closer to $15,000 with further rounds."
