"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $9500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10500.  If you're not able to go that low, I'll need to consider my other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
