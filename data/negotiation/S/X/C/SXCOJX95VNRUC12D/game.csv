"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",700000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm thinking $725,000 is a fair price for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, this is getting frustrating.  We're close, but your price jumps are getting too big. I'm willing to go up slightly, to $700,000 even.  Take it or leave it - this is my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,8,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $750,000, so I'm offering $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",725000.0,Alice,9,,
