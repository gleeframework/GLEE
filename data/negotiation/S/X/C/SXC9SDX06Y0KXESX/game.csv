"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. ",10750.0,Alice,3,
