Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $11,000 is more than $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** $11,000 is less than your minimum of $12,000, meaning you're open to making a deal. 
* **It shows good faith:** You're not immediately asking for your full desired price, indicating a willingness to compromise. 

I'll let you know how Bob responds, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:** It's a middle ground between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). 
* **Reasonable:** It's closer to my minimum than Bob's offer, while still being within a potentially acceptable range for him.
* **Positive framing:** I highlight the benefits for both of us, emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both parties."
