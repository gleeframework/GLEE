"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  The product is only worth $15,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $18,000. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He should counteroffer again and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $16,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal today."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is not budging on her price, and even though she's offering a price slightly below her initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit. With John offering the product for $15,000, it's a better deal for Bob and eliminates the need for further negotiations."
