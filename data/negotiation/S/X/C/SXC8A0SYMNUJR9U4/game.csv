"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $16500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $15500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm ready to make a deal today.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",16000.0,Alice,5,
