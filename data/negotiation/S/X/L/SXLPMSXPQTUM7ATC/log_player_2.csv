"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is far above your maximum budget of $80.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Alice, considering she values the product at $100. It also signals to Alice that you are serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for a product you'll really enjoy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $95 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since I know I can get it for $80 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice that I am willing to negotiate but still holding firm to my budget.  It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
