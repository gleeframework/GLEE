Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice seems firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,000 saves you $4,000 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks the deal falling through."
