"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in.  It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing that the product is worth a lot to him, which could motivate him to accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** I'm setting the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, which is still a good deal for you, Alice. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $80 is my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $100 I initially offered.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Since I have 10 rounds, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fail, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a fair price, I'm looking for something a little closer to my asking price of $100. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the $90 price as a ""great deal"" for both of us, highlighting the potential win-win scenario.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, making the negotiation more transparent and potentially building trust with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $85. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $85 is much closer to my minimum price of $80 and only $5 away from my last offer. 
* **Limited Time:**  We're now in Round 4, and I want to avoid risking further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, I'm hoping to get a slightly higher price from Bob, and $85 is a good compromise."
