Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $12,000 is less than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Maximize your profit:**  You're aiming for a high starting price to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's response and counteroffers.
* **Have a backup plan:** You can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, you can likely do better. Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than $8,000, and you're aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Counter with a higher price:** You can send a counteroffer that is closer to your original offer of $12,000.
* **Continue negotiating:** You can see if there's more room for compromise and potentially reach a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you are strategically continuing the negotiation, hoping to achieve a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $10,500 is well above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You haven't completely closed the gap, giving Bob a reason to consider your offer.

By counteroffering with $10,500, you are demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price. This approach balances your desire for profit with the need to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is still below your original offer, it is very close to your counteroffer of $10,500. It's also above your minimum and significantly higher than what you'd get from John. 

Considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the fact that you're getting closer to a deal, accepting his offer is a good choice. It ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
