"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable price for the value of this product. How about $1,050,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a reasonable price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
