"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a significant $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with a price of $900,000, reflecting its potential and my investment. I'm open to negotiation, but I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's chat!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm proposing $850,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit for me while remaining within a reasonable range for you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, and I'm offering $825,000. This price allows for a more reasonable profit margin for me, and it's also closer to your target.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. This is my final offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the closest I can get to my target price of $800,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,6,
