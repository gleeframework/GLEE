"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price to make this deal truly worthwhile.  I'm happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This still represents a significant profit for us while remaining a competitive price for you. I look forward to your feedback and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
