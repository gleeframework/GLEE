"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discounted rate. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than her own value of the product ($800,000), meaning there's potential for a better deal.  There's also significant room for negotiation before reaching your maximum price of $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This still represents a significant profit for us while remaining a competitive price for you. I look forward to your feedback and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than her own value of the product ($800,000) and leaves room for further negotiation. It's also still below your maximum price, so there's no immediate need to go to John. A counteroffer from you might result in a better price."
