{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $12,000 is her lowest price.  This doesn't leave much room for negotiation and it's unlikely she'll move much further. While we could try to haggle a little more, it's getting risky. 

At this point, it's better to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed price of $15,000 from John. This ensures we get the product and avoids the risk of the negotiations failing completely with Alice."
