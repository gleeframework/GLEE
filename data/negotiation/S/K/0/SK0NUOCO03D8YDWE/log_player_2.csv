"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1100000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price is still fair for both of us and allows us to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to his target, he's only $50,000 away from his ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating for a better price, potentially reaching the $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer, I'm still hoping to land at $1,025,000.  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1025000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1037500. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is only $37,500 more than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  Considering this is Alice's final offer and Bob has 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is too high.  If Bob rejects the offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and he could end up paying more or having to buy from John.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is close to his target."
