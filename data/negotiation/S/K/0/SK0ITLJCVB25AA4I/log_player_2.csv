"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $850,000, and has stated it's her final offer. While closer to your goal, you have the option to buy from John for $800,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk losing out on John's offer if you continue negotiating."
