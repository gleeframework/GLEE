"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $1,200,000?  This would still give you a substantial opportunity to profit from this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm feeling confident that $1000000 is a fair price considering the potential value of this product, and it aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had five rounds of negotiations. I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
