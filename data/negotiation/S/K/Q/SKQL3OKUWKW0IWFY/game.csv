"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the potential value of this product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $1200000?  This would still give you a substantial opportunity to profit from this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1100000, which I believe is a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm feeling confident that $1000000 is a fair price considering the potential value of this product, and it aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to accept that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
