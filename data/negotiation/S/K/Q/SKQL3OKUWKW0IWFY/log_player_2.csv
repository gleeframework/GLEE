Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $1200000?  This would still give you a substantial opportunity to profit from this product.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer, but only incrementally. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also that I have a limit.

* **Open to Discussion:** I'm asking for her opinion, inviting her to counter again if needed."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950000 is still below my minimum.

Would you be willing to accept that?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**
