"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is tempting, but not ideal:**  While $110 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** There's room for Bob to negotiate a lower price, especially since the product is worth $120 to Alice. 
* **Time to counter:** Bob has 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer gives him a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can work closer to $100.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $10 counteroffer shows Bob is serious about saving money but isn't being unreasonable. 
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:** Bob's message focuses on finding a ""price that works for both of us,"" suggesting he's willing to compromise. 
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This counteroffer opens the door for further negotiation, giving Alice room to come down a bit without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get the product at a lower price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has come down from $110 to $105, which is a good compromise.
* **Meeting halfway:** Alice's message explicitly mentions ""meeting you halfway,"" reinforcing the sense of a fair offer.
* **Value proposition:** Alice's message emphasizes the product's value, adding a bit of pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Time is a factor:**  With 7 rounds remaining, accepting at $105 saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John, and sets a good precedent for future negotiations."
