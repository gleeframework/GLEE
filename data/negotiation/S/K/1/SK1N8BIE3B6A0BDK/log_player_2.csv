Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to hold out for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice seems firm on a price above our budget. It's unlikely she'll go below $11,000, and we have a guaranteed option at $10,000 with John. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
