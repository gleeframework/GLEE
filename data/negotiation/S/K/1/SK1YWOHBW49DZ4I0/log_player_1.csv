""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I think $950,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

Bob is now offering my baseline price. It's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer in further rounds, or the time it takes to negotiate higher.  I'll accept the $800,000."
