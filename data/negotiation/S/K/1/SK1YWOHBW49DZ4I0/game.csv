"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I think $950,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
