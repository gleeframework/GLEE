"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. My asking price is $1800000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work for me, I'm willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, to make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1500000. This price still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair value given the product's potential. Let's continue to find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product.  $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1000000 is still below my minimum threshold. To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1300000.  This price is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the true value of this product. I'm confident we can find a final price that satisfies both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1300000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a fair and realistic price considering the potential value of the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $1100000 is getting closer, but I need to be at least $1200000 to make this deal work for me.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits both parties.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm encouraged by our progress and your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
