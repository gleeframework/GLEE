"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. My asking price is $1,800,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work for me, I'm willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a sale quickly, selling for $800,000 would result in a substantial loss. It's better to continue negotiations and aim for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, to make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,500,000. This price still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair value given the product's potential. Let's continue to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price, showing flexibility.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting my minimum threshold and emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and expressing a willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price for the product.  $1500000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant increase, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is also an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum threshold. To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,300,000.  This price is a significant compromise on my end, and it reflects the true value of this product. I'm confident we can find a final price that satisfies both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000, which is a compromise from my previous price of $1,500,000 but still above my minimum threshold.
* **Justification:** I'm explaining my position, reiterating my minimum threshold and emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, expressing confidence in finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1300000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  To find a price that works for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a fair and realistic price considering the potential value of the product, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still a bit below.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a good option, but I'd prefer to try and get a better deal with Bob if possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I need to be at least $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at my minimum threshold of $1,200,000.

* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, expressing confidence in reaching a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm encouraged by our progress and your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is only $50,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. However, with only two rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that he'll increase his offer further. It's risky to gamble on another round of negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000.  Securing the deal with John is the most prudent decision, as it ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further potential losses."
