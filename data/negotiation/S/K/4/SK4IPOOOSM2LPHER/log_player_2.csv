"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe $950,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and Alice's counteroffer is still higher than his target. While it's a better deal than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to try and push for a price closer to his initial counteroffer."
