Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Could you do $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate before reaching our $120 fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price point that's a good deal for us and still profitable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can meet you at $97, but I can also do $99. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come up to $99, and while we could try to push for $97, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting at $99 secures us a good deal and avoids the risk of her withdrawing the offer."
