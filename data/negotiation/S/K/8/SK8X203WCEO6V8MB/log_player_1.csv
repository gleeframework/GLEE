"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

 I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and meets you closer to your desired price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.  It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
