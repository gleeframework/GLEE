"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1000000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000.
