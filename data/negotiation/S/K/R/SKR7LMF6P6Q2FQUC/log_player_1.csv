Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $120 to someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $115 gives Bob a small discount while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $100 provides a safety net, allowing Alice to aim higher with Bob."
