"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This represents a significant move from my previous offer and should be very close to your desired price point.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
