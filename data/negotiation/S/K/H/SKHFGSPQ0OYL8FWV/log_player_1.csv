Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and a decent profit. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the potential value Bob sees in the product. This encourages him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate from a strong position:**  I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, so I can afford to be flexible but not desperate.
* **Start with a reasonable offer:**  This increases the chances of Bob accepting or at least counter-offering.
* **Be prepared to counter:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I'll be ready to adjust the price based on his counteroffer. 

This approach aims to maximize my earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think the product is worth the full $1,400,000. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Selling to John would bring in more profit. 
* **Counter-offer opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Don't settle for less:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum requirements. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and have other options, which strengthens my position in the negotiation. 
* **Aim for a mutually beneficial agreement:** I want to find a price that works for both Bob and me, but I'm not willing to sacrifice too much.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still acknowledges his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  My counter-offer is $1,350,000. This price is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $1,400,000, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the potential benefit for both of us. I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise but also expressing my own needs. 

**Strategy:**

* **Stay firm but flexible:**  I'm not willing to go below my minimum price, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and how this offer represents a fair deal. 
* **Focus on a mutually beneficial agreement:**  My goal is to reach a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  While I want to reach an agreement with Bob, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 

**Strategy:**

* **Protect my bottom line:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a less favorable outcome. 
* **Maximize earnings:**  Selling to John ensures the most profitable outcome for me.

**Outcome:**

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit of $1,500,000, which is my desired outcome."
