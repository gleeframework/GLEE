Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's definitely worth more than $10,000 to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By offering a price less than Bob's perceived value, it demonstrates you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will walk away from the deal completely, as he clearly values the product at $12,000.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking $10,750 would be a better fit for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only $250 less than my previous offer, and it's more than what John is offering. At this point, it's a good idea to accept.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's likely Bob won't budge much further. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a deal falling apart completely."
