Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.
