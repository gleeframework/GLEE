``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving you a profit margin. I'm keeping the price slightly lower than what John would pay, giving me some flexibility in case Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll counter with a price that's closer to my ideal price point."
