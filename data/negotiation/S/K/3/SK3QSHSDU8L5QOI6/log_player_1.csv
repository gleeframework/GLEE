"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try and counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,250,000, $1,175,000 is still a good deal. It's more than what John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
