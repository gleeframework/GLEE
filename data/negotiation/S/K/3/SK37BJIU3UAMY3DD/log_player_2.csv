"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth over $100 to me. I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start with a price of $85. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.**  Bob is willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to control the negotiation.** By making a counteroffer, Bob can steer the price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product seems interesting, $85 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $70 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within Bob's budget:** $70 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's $120 limit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but it's also a strong opening move in the negotiation.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By starting with $70, there's still space for Alice to counter with a price closer to $85 if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. To move forward, I propose a price of $75 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is close to Bob's desired price.** $75 is only $5 higher than Bob's counteroffer of $70.
* **There's a good chance Alice won't budge much lower.**  She's already made a concession, and further haggling might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **It's a good deal for Bob.**  While Bob could potentially get it for $70, $75 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $120.

**This is a good time for Bob to accept and avoid risking a stalemate.**  He's likely to get a better price than he would from John, and there's a chance further negotiation might backfire."
