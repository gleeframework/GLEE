"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe it's a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think, Bob?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.  This is my absolute top price, and I hope you'll reconsider.",8500.0,Bob,4,
