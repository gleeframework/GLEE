Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us even closer to his maximum.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's $12,000 offer risks Bob rejecting it outright.  

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing profit while still ensuring a sale even if he declines."
