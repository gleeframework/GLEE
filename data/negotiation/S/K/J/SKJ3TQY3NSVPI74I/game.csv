"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my value. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $825,000, so I'll offer $787,500. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",787500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $787,500 is still too far below my value. Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows you to stay within your budget. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
