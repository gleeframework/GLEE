Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob understands exactly what's being offered.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, so be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects your initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above Bob's value, it's below my minimum. I want to try and push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $130.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, it's clear that he's firm on his price. Since selling to John will net me a higher profit ($150 vs. $130),  it's the best option at this point."
