"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives room to maneuver upwards.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer gauges Alice's flexibility. Her reaction will provide valuable information for the next round. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** The option to buy from John at $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing for bolder counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $800,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still flexibility in the price.
* **Leveraging John:** The presence of John's offer gives us leverage to push for a more favorable price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you consider $725,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while recognizing the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  This counteroffer moves significantly closer to Alice's price while still staying well below John's offer. 
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By increasing the offer, we signal to Alice that we are serious about buying but need to see more movement on her end.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still well below our maximum budget, preserving our ability to negotiate further or switch to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and $725,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $900,000 is her final offer, meaning further negotiation with her is unlikely.
* **John's Price is Better:**  John's standing offer of $800,000 saves us a significant $100,000 compared to Alice's final offer. 
* **No Guarantee of Success:** Even with further counteroffers, there's no guarantee we could get Alice below $800,000. It's not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed deal with John."
