"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming for a good profit margin.  I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate downwards, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'll counter with a price closer to my value, and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. This is a more reasonable price considering my minimum value, but it still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only $10 above my minimum price, it's still a profit.  I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might lower his offer again in the next round, or even decide to walk away. Selling to John would be the safest option, but it wouldn't be as profitable as this deal."
