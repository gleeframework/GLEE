"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of a quick sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $100,000 difference allows for some back-and-forth with Bob while still ensuring Alice remains well above her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both Bob's perceived value and my initial offer. There's a good chance we can negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000, which makes it worth continuing the negotiation for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Countering shows I'm willing to negotiate, which can help build trust.
* **Strong Position:** By proposing a price directly in the middle, I'm demonstrating fairness while remaining firm on a price point significantly above my minimum. 
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court and might encourage him to accept, knowing I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically and incrementally increasing his offers.  While $950,000 is tempting, holding firm for another round might push him closer to the $1,000,000 mark. The potential gain outweighs the risk of losing the deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both see the value in this product. Let's close this deal - I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Create Urgency:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency, which might push Bob to accept.
* **Minor Concession:** Accepting his halfway point on this round shows flexibility but still keeps the price well above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:** While presented as final, it allows Bob to feel like he secured a deal by accepting this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has now also presented a ""final offer,"" indicating he's serious about closing the deal.
* **Minimal Difference:**  The difference between his offer ($960,000) and my last offer ($975,000) is relatively small in the context of the overall deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely, leaving me with John's offer of $800,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a significant profit above my minimum."
