"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential profit. I'm assuming that Bob will likely counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate from there. I'm also keeping in mind the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this will be seen as a reasonable price, and we can finalize the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,750,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to counteroffer again. I'm keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John, but I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,850,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's last offer. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,700,000 is getting close to my minimum, I still want to try to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John as a real possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but I'm not willing to go lower.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.  While $1,650,000 is a good price, I'm not sure I can get him any higher.  I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
