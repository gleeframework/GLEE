"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to invest closer to $800,000.  Would that work for you?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best offer for now.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget is closer to $900,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum value of $1,100,000. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to meet my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $975,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
