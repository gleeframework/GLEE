Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, considering the product is worth $800,000 to him.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John in the loop as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to close the deal quickly, I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. If Bob still refuses, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate, but it's still a price that allows me to make a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to the deal. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'll also be watching John's interest closely."
