"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I want to start with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Strategic first offer:** $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my minimum value, but it's not an unreasonable number, especially if I believe the product could be worth more to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I want to be able to compromise if necessary, so I'm not starting with a price that's impossible for Bob to reach.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  This strategy balances the risk of Bob walking away with the potential for a high return.
* **Bob's perceived value:** I need to consider how much I think Bob might be willing to pay for the product. The more I think it's worth to him, the higher I can start.
* **Time pressure:**  Knowing I have only 10 rounds, I need to be aggressive but not overly pushy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's low offer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value. It's too low to accept at this point, as it doesn't reflect the potential value of the product.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I still have 8 rounds left. There's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Sell to John:** Selling to John right now wouldn't be advantageous as I haven't explored all options with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob in round 3.  I will need to carefully consider how high I want to go, balancing the risk of him rejecting the offer with the potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and signal:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my initial price, but it still reflects the value I believe the product holds. It signals my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Strategic reduction:** Reducing the price by $300,000 shows that I am open to compromise. 
* **Time pressure:** While I have 7 rounds remaining, I need to move towards a deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's reaction:**  This offer will gauge how serious Bob is about buying the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Potential counteroffers:** I need to be ready to either accept a counteroffer from Bob or propose a further reduction in price if necessary. 
* **John as an option:** I still have John as a backup, but I want to continue exploring options with Bob to potentially secure a better price."
