"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to me, so paying $15,000 is not a good deal. I'll look for a better price elsewhere.
