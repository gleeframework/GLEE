I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000.  This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to ask for a higher price.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to accept $900,000, I know the product is worth significantly more to me. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. Hopefully, this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  It's likely Bob is trying to lowball me, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if he doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer."

I'm dropping the price again to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's counteroffers.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll take John's deal."
