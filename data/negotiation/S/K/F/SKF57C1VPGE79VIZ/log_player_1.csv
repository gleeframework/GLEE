Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer price, indicating he's willing to negotiate. While $950,000 is a good profit, we still have room to negotiate a higher price. We're aiming closer to $1,000,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,010,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $985,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product, and his offer of $985,000 is a significant profit above our minimum. While we could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if we reject this offer. It's better to secure a great deal now than risk losing him entirely in pursuit of a slightly larger profit."
