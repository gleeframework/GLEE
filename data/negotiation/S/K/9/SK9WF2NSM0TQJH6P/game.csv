"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price that's still a great deal for you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.50?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm really interested in getting this product.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $88.50 is still below what I need to get for this product. Let's try $90.50 as a final offer. It's a fair price, and I really think you'll love this product.",90.5,Alice,5,
