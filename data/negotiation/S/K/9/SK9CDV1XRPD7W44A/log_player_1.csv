Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without you having to accept a price you're unhappy with.
* **It shows confidence:**  By not starting with a lower price, you demonstrate confidence in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the value you place on the product. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired value, keeping in mind that if the negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility by coming down from the initial offer, but it also doesn't concede too much. 
* **Staying above your minimum:** $11,000 is still higher than your minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Appealing to value:**  The message reiterates that this is a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, I see where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is just slightly above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise and a reasonable price considering the risk of going another round and potentially ending up with the lower offer from John.  The small profit is better than risking a failed negotiation and a lower payout."
