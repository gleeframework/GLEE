"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for me and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,
