I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value, but not so high that it's likely to immediately scare Bob away.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's only $500 less than my counteroffer and  a significant improvement over selling to John. It seems like we're both getting closer to a price that works for us."
