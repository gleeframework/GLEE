"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing your product. However, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the product is worth $12,000 to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $12,200. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to me. Let me know if you're open to this.",12200.0,Bob,4,
