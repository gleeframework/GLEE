"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but not so high that it would immediately deter Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to accept $12,000 from John, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the current price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but still trying to get a higher price from Bob.  I'm hoping he will be willing to pay a bit more to avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to get more, Bob's offers are not getting me closer to my desired price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not sure I'll get a better price with Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
