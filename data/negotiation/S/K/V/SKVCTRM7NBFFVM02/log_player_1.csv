Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm aware of the product's value to Bob. I'm confident that this initial offer will start a productive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate its value, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my spending below $100. Could we perhaps agree on $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $120, $95 is still a decent profit and higher than selling to John. It's important to recognize that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I'm confident that Bob is likely at his price limit.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent return."
