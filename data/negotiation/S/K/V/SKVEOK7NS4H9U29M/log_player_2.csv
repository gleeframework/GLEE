"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This price reflects its worth while leaving room for negotiation. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value and your willingness to pay, I propose a price of $11,000. This price aims to be fair for both parties and leaves some room for negotiation. I hope this aligns better with your budget. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob is likely to still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

This would be a good price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
