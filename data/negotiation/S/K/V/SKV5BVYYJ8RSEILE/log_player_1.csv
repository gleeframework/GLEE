I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, aiming to maximize my potential earnings.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but it sets a baseline for the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $1,500,000, I believe I can do better. Bob's offer is at my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  There are still rounds left, and I want to explore if I can get closer to $1,750,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,650,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, and hopefully will be attractive enough for him to consider.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I want to try to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and closing the sale."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $1,625,000 is a good deal that exceeds my minimum.  It's time to secure the sale and avoid the risk of losing a good offer."
