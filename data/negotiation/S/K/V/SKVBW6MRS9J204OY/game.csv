,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you meet me halfway at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
