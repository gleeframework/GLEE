Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,125. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on her price, it's clear that getting her much below $10,000 is unlikely. At this point, the potential savings from further haggling are outweighed by the risk of Alice not budging enough. John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed win, and it's better to secure that price now than risk ending up with a worse deal from Alice."
