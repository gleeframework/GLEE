"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would you consider a counteroffer of $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your budget constraints, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my situation. I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I still cannot meet the price. Could you possibly lower it to $1,800,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the $1,800,000 offer is still quite a distance from what I need to make this worthwhile.  My final offer is $1,900,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope it reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and understand your position. However, given my financial constraints, I'm unable to accept $1,900,000. I propose a counteroffer of $1,700,000. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
