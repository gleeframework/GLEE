"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1500000 is my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still unable to meet at $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what we can agree upon.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
