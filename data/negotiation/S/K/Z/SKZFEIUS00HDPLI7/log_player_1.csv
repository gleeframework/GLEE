"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable opportunity with significant potential.  My starting price is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while leaving room for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value is higher:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, let alone my desired price.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe we can still negotiate a higher price. Bob has already shown willingness to pay more than $800,000.
* **Stronger position:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 

I'll use the next round to counter with a higher price and see if we can find a meeting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm raising the price to $950,000, which is still lower than my initial offer but closer to Bob's value.
* **Show compromise:** I emphasize that this price is a ""significant compromise"" to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting his current offer, indicating my commitment to getting a fair price.
* **Focus on mutually beneficial outcome:**  I highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.

By strategically counter-offering, I'm aiming to get closer to my target price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Can you consider $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my target price of $950,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm happy with this price, I still have some room to negotiate in the future if the opportunity arises. 
* **Time constraint:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid losing the deal with Bob and potentially losing out on a better price.

While I would have preferred to reach my target price, accepting this offer ensures I sell the product at a good price and avoid the risk of Bob backing out entirely."
