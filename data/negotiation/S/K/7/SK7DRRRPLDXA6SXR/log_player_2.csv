# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject her offer and try to push for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little hesitant at $1,050,000. I'm willing to go to $1,025,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $1,040,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,040,000 is very close to my target price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that is within my budget and saves me a considerable amount of money compared to John's price."
