"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and preferences. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that reflects both its worth and your interest. Would you be open to exploring a mutually beneficial arrangement? Considering the product's value to you, I suggest we start our discussion around $135. Let me know what you think, and we can proceed from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer of $135 is only slightly below your maximum price. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. 
* There's a good chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer since she still profits at a lower price point.  
* If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $150."
