Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider the value this product brings to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your reservation price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to get a lower price, or buying from John for the same amount."
