"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close. I can tell we're both eager to close this deal.  How about we settle at $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $910,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $915,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",915000.0,Alice,7,
