"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it a valuable asset.  My initial price is $1150000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1150000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1075000. Can we meet in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to work with you, $1075000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1112500.  This would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1112500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1075000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. Can we meet in the middle again?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
