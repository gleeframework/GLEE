{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below your minimum, but it's close.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product, which is fair considering John is also offering it for that price. Let's settle this and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum value. It's time to accept and close the deal. It's not ideal to get my minimum, but it's better than selling to John and getting the same price. There's always a chance of another buyer coming along with a better offer, but it's not worth the risk."
