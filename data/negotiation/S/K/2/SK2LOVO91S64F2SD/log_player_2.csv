(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This is still a great price for the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's close this deal!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her original offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Since Bob has an alternative option with John for $10,000, rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try to get a better price."
