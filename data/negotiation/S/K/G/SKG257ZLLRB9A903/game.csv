"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and the benefits you'll gain.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your operations. I'm confident that this product will deliver substantial returns for you.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value it will bring.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that price remains outside of my budget.  To be frank, I've been exploring other options, and to move forward with you, I'd need a price closer to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the serious interest I have in purchasing this product from you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the offer.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To meet you closer to your budget, I propose a price of $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. To be completely transparent, I've received a compelling offer from another seller at a price significantly closer to my budget.  If we can agree on $1,250,000 for this product, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to seriously consider my other option.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand the position you're in, and I value your business.  While your offer is tempting, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a price closer to my original proposal.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but to be honest, $1,550,000 is simply too far from what I'm prepared to pay. I've been very clear about my budget and the alternative offer I have available. If you're unable to meet my price of $1,300,000 for this product, then I'm afraid we won't be able to make a deal.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
