"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it and  allows for some room to make a deal.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $1,000,000 is still below my initial assessment, I'm willing to consider offers closer to $1,600,000.  This offer takes into account the value you see and allows me to make a reasonable compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to making this deal work.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
