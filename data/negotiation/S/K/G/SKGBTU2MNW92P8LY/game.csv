"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $850,000. Would you consider $900,000?  It's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects the true value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",875000.0,Bob,4,
