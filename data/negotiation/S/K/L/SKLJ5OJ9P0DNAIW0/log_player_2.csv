# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. This reflects the significant value it holds for you as well. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

While I'm committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm unable to accept your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to both walk away with a satisfactory outcome.
