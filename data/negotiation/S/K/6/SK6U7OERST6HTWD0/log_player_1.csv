"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $8,000 might have been a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to counter again, hoping to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference at $10,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
