,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to compromise if it means we can make a deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
