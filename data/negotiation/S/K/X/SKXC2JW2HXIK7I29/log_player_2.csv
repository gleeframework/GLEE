"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident in the value this product holds, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price by counteroffering."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that keeps us both close to our target prices."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I can't accept anything below $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's a chance Alice might eventually come down to Bob's price, there's no guarantee.  It's better to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price.  This avoids further negotiation and potential risk of not reaching an agreement."
