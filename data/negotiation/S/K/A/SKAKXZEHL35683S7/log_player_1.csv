Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, focusing on his potential benefit rather than my need to sell. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, implying I'm willing to negotiate further.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a good price.
* **Avoid a stalemate:**  If Bob rejects, it prompts him to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation. 
* **Secure a backup option:**  If negotiations stall or fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does indicate his willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $12,000 is always a guaranteed option, but I haven't exhausted all possibilities with Bob yet. Rejecting his offer keeps that option open. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:**  I'm offering a counterproposal at $8,500, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a compromise by suggesting a price ""in the middle"". This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a favorable position.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm still emphasizing the value proposition for Bob (""good deal for you""). 
* **Open-ended Approach:** The message encourages further discussion, allowing for potential adjustments or concessions. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Increase my potential profit:**  $8,500 is a much better price than $6,000.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I haven't closed the door on John's offer yet, allowing for a backup if negotiations fail. 
* **Engage in a productive dialogue:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and explores a potential mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stay under $8,000.  Would you do $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $7,500 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $12,000 is still a viable option, and I haven't exhausted all negotiation possibilities with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise closer to $8,000. This will demonstrate my commitment to negotiation while still aiming for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $8,000, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we settle on $7,800? This is just a little bit higher than your offer, but it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here!"", ""product_price"": 7800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  This price is also still a bit lower than my last offer, showing that I'm actively negotiating.
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $7,800 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I maintain a decent profit margin.
* **Focus on Finding Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" fostering a collaborative approach.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I'm leaving the door open for continued negotiation, implying a willingness to adjust my offer if necessary.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** While approaching Bob's desired price, it doesn't commit to a price below my minimum. 
* **Increase potential profit:** $7,800 is significantly better than $7,500, and still closer to my desired profit. 
* **Encourage a resolution:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price."
