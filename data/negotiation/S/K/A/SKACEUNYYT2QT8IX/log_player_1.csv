Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly lower than what I believe Bob might be willing to pay, based on his perceived value of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and engaging, highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** By starting high, I have room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also keeping John's offer of $150 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).  While it's tempting to take $120, it's not worth the loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great product and I know you'll enjoy it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum ($150) but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm remaining friendly and positive while reiterating the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between our initial offers while keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's getting closer, I'm not confident that I can get him to go any higher.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiations."
