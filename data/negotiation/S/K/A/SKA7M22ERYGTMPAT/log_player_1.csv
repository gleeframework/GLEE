Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline and leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction will be."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering $1,800,000.  With only three rounds left, I'm getting closer to Bob's price point. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to accept, but I'm also prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense. Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get a higher price within the remaining rounds. To avoid potentially ending up with a lower price or a stalemate, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees a sale and meets my minimum price."
