"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000. Would that be feasible?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
