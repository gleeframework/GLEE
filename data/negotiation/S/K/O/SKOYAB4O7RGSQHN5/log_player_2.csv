"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I want to start the negotiation significantly lower to give myself room to bargain.
* **Polite and Interested:** My message expresses interest in the product but makes it clear that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Target a Good Deal:**  By aiming for $6,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that saves me a significant amount compared to both Alice's initial offer and John's backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my range, but I'm still paying a premium over John's price.  I'll try negotiating one more time.  If Alice doesn't budge significantly, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down $3,000. By countering at $7,000, I'm essentially proposing we each split the difference from the previous round again.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer is my last strong attempt to secure a deal with Alice. If she doesn't accept this, I'll likely go with John's offer.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** Even though this is a firm counteroffer, I'm keeping the tone respectful and appreciative to leave a positive impression, even if we don't reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, which is above my maximum budget and John's offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile.  John's offer provides a guaranteed price within my budget, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
