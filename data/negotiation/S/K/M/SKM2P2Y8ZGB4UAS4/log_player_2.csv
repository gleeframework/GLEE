**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it, considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8000}
