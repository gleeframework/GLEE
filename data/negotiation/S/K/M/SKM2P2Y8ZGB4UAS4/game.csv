"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects the value it brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it, considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can work something out.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",8000.0,Bob,4,
