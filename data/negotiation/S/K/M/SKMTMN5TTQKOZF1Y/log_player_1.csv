Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing us a higher price than our backup offer from John ($80). 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to both the seller and Bob, increasing its perceived worth.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation where Bob gets a product he values and Alice secures a price significantly higher than her minimum."
