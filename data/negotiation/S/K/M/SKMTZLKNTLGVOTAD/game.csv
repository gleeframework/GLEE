"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that brings us closer.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
