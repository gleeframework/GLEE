Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price above $1,350,000, and with 6 rounds remaining, we can afford to push a little further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching an agreement. However, $1,325,000 is a bit too far from what I had in mind. Let's settle this at $1,340,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which is $1,330,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's below our initial target, it's still a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away, especially since we are getting diminishing returns with each counteroffer. Accepting now secures a good deal."
