"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $20,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is trying to save money and Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $12,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is my best price for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob can still get a better deal.  $17,500 is a bit too high for him, but he can still try to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise at $16,000, but that's my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money, and $16,000 is more than he's willing to pay. He can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's also worth noting that if he rejects this offer, he can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute final offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, which is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has reached his limit and it's clear Alice is not going to budge. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000 rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially get stuck with a higher price."
