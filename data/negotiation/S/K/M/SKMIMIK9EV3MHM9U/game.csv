"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $12,000 right now. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is my best price for now.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise at $16,000, but that's my final offer for now.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute final offer.",15000.0,Bob,6,
