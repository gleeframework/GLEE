"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of the product, $900000 is still a bit steep for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I'd like to offer $800000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
