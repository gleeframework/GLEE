Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $18,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and provides insight into his perceived value of the product. His response will help inform your next move.
* **Walk Away Option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives you a strong fallback position. You don't have to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit tight on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer being your minimum acceptable price suggests he might be willing to go a bit higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to push for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground makes the offer seem more appealing and encourages Bob to engage further. 
* **Maintaining Value:** You're still emphasizing the value of the product without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $13,500 is a significant profit above your minimum selling price of $12,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob's offer is reasonable and pushing further could lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Prolonged negotiations could delay receiving payment and potentially even allow for unforeseen circumstances to arise."
