"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $137.50. This is a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $132 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $135. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $130, and I think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth it for me to continue negotiating. I'll meet you at $131, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",131.0,Bob,8,
