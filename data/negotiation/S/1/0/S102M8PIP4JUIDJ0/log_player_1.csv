``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point. I'm also trying to create a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum price yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $130 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $137.50. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $132 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $135. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable going above $130, and I think we're getting close to the point where it's not worth it for me to continue negotiating. I'll meet you at $131, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low and we're running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
