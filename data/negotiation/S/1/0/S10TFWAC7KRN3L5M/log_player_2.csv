Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're making a strong effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is holding firm:**  She's returned to her previous offer of $1,050,000 and called it her ""final concession."" This suggests she's unlikely to move much lower.
* **Time is a factor:** You have four rounds left, but continuing to push could irritate Alice and risk the deal.
* **Significant Savings:** You're still getting the product for $450,000 less than John's price, a substantial saving. 

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential benefit."
