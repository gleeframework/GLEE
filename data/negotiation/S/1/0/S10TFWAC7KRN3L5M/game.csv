"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're making a strong effort to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
