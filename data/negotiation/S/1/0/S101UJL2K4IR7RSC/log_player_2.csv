"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $108 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely get it for less with continued negotiation.  He's already shown he's willing to walk away and has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really close to my budget limit. Would you be willing to come down to $106?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really close to your budget limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $107. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached a point where further negotiation might not yield a better price. Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has come down significantly. At this point, accepting Alice's offer at $107 saves Bob $3 compared to buying from John, and it's only $1 more than his previous counteroffer.  It's a good compromise that allows Bob to save money while securing the product."
