This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too low for me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is closer to my minimum.  I'll take the safe bet and sell to John."
