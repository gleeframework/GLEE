"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $180.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 180} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within the range that Bob might be willing to pay (given his perceived value). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $180, I leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Be Friendly:** A friendly opening message can help build rapport and keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have room to negotiate and can make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a good value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $160 is a compromise that is above my minimum but still within a range that Bob might consider. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the discount from my original offer and the value of the product for Bob can make my counteroffer more appealing.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $140 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still within the negotiation and there's room for a slight increase.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that might push the price even closer to my target. 
* **John is still an option:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $145.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer to $145, but it's still below my minimum, giving me room for a potential counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on Fair Price:**  I'm stressing that this is a fair price for both of us, which can encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  Using phrases like ""let's close this deal"" can create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision."
