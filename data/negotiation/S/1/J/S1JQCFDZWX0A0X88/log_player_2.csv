"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you and we believe it's a great value. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both of us. I propose a price of $105 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can likely get a better price than $105 since you value the product at $120. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your decision. To continue our discussion, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This offers a slight compromise while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially negotiate a lower price. You value the product at $120 and have 7 rounds left. Let's see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $95. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $97.50?  This would still give you a fair profit and would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After considering your last offer, I am willing to meet halfway between our positions. Therefore, I propose a price of $98.50 for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $98.50, which is very close to your target price of $95.  You have 5 rounds left, but at this point, it's likely that you won't get a much better deal.  Accepting this offer is a good move to secure the product without risking further negotiation."
