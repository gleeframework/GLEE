"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $135 is better than nothing, I can likely do better by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to $155, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $145 is close to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a slightly better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
``` 
I'm going to stick to my minimum acceptable price of $150. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
