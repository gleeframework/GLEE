Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but also shows I'm confident in the product's worth.  I'll be ready to adjust if needed, but starting high is a good tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I'll counter his offer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will get me closer to my desired price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so selling to him is the best course of action."
