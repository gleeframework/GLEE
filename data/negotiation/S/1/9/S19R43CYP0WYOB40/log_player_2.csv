"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $10,250.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer will save Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and the current offer is closer to Bob's desired price.

Considering the potential savings and the progress made in negotiations, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for Bob at this point."
