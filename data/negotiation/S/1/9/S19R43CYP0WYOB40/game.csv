"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This reflects the product's true value.",10250.0,Alice,3,
