Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly hint that the price is justified without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly (or implying other buyers exist), you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he tries to haggle the price down. Remember, your absolute minimum is $12,000."
