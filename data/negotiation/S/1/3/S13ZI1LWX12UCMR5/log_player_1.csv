Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price.  

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a slight risk. If Bob rejects the offer and you need to go back to John, you've lost some negotiating power. However, the potential for higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
