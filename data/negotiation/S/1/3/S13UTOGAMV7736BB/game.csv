,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can offer you a compromise at $100. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $92.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer you the product for $98. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",98.0,Alice,7,
