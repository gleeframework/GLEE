"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. We are offering it to you at a special introductory price of $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let us know if you are interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for Alice to come down in price, as the product is worth $10,000 to her.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product would be a valuable addition to my collection."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To meet somewhere in the middle, we propose an adjusted price of $10,750 for the product. This offer reflects a compromise between our original price and your counteroffer, aiming for mutual benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:** $10,750 is only $250 more than Bob's desired price of $10,500. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time, and Bob might not want to prolong the process if he's confident this is a fair price."
