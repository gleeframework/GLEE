"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is within your budget of $100.
* **Buying from John costs $100.**  This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer, as it saves you $10."
