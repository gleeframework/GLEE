Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to your desired $150.
* **It's not too high:**  If you start too high, Bob might be immediately turned off and unlikely to engage.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message clearly states your offer and invites Bob to respond.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you can make a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $125. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what you want.  You can try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'd be willing to come down to $135.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
