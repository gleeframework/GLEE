Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob sees extra value.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  The $140 offer allows for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and you can still come down slightly while remaining above your minimum.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject $140. However, you have John as a guaranteed backup at $150. It's worth aiming slightly higher with Bob for the chance to earn more."
