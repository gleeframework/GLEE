"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a fair starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm also trying to emphasize that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a few more rounds to try to get a better price, and selling to John is always an option if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price and I'm confident he'll be happy with the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price. I still have a few rounds left before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $92 is still too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $95, which is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the compromise and expressing my confidence in a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $92.50, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John. We're down to the wire, and I've been unable to get Bob to meet my minimum acceptable price. John is guaranteed to pay $120, which is more than Bob's final offer, and  better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
