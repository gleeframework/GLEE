"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",97.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $92 is still too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
