"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's better to try to negotiate further to get a better price.  There's potential to get closer to Bob's target price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price.  While $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
