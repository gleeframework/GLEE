"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $125, which is a good deal, but you can still get it cheaper from John for $150.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save more money."
