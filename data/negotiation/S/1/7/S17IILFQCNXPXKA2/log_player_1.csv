"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Ambitious start:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This sets a high bar and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Prepared for rejection:**  I'm aware Bob might reject this offer. I'm prepared to counter-offer or move to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 10 rounds, I can afford to continue negotiating. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my initial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Moderate compromise:** My counteroffer is a reduction from my initial price, but still above Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Strategic positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It suggests I'm serious about reaching a deal but am not willing to give in entirely.
* **Assessing Bob's response:**  This counteroffer will allow me to gauge Bob's true level of interest and his willingness to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe we can still find a better price.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I can continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price than what John is offering. 
* **Maintaining my position:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell and will continue to push for a price closer to my expectations.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Significant concession:**  My counteroffer is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility. It also brings me closer to Bob's last offer, suggesting a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a ""testing the waters"" move. I'm seeing if Bob is willing to meet me halfway and if there's potential for a deal to be struck in the remaining rounds. 
* **Maintaining my position:** While lowering my price, I am still offering a significant sum. I'm confident that I can still get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Reaching the minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd ideally like to get more, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation.
* **No further bargaining power:**  With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can convince Bob to raise his offer significantly. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000. This offers certainty and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential failure to reach a deal with Bob.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob, selling to John is the most sensible option."
