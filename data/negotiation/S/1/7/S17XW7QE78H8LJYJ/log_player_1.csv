Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her own minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering it slightly below Bob's value increases the chances he'll accept, avoiding the risk of having to sell to John (while still making a profit).

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know for certain that Bob values the product at $8,000. If she had that information, she could offer it at $7,999 to maximize her profit."
