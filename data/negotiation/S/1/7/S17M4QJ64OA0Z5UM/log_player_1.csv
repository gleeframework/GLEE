Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm willing to sell it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $115 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($5). This price is likely to be accepted by Bob as it's a better deal than losing the product altogether."
