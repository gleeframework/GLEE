"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. While I see its value, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This would still be a profitable transaction for you, considering your valuation of $1,000,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",920000.0,Alice,3,
