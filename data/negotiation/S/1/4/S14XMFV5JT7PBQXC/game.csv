"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? That would be a great price for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
