"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and still secure a good profit.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing it's a ""great deal"" for him. This can make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling that I'm open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, his willingness to negotiate shows he's interested in the product. This opens the door for further rounds of negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:** I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering and continuing the negotiation. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would give us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, highlighting that I'm not trying to take advantage of him. 
* **Still profitable:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

This counter-offer aims to strike a balance between my desire to get a good price and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? That would be a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would be a significant financial loss.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left. Selling to John at $15,000 is becoming a more attractive option.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While I'm hesitant to accept this offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to compromise. 

I will reject Bob's offer but remain open to further negotiation. My goal is to get closer to my target price or secure the sale with John if a reasonable deal cannot be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and firmness:** I'm offering a compromise, lowering my price again, but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I'm emphasizing that this price is good for *both* of us,  appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm explicitly mentioning closing the deal, adding a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between flexibility and firmness, while also  trying to  push Bob towards accepting a deal closer to my target price."
