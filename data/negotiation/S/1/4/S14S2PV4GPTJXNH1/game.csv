"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fantastic product that I know you'll love.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
