"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500,  which still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about $13,000?  It's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $13,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it'll allow us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,6,
