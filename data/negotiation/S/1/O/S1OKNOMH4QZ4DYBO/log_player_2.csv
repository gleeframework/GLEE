"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000), but still within your budget ($1,500,000). 
* However, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, but still slightly higher than you'd like to pay. 
* You're still aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating.  
* You can try to meet her halfway or propose a slightly higher price than your initial offer to see if you can reach an agreement."
