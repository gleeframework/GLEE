"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $9000. This would be a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,5,
