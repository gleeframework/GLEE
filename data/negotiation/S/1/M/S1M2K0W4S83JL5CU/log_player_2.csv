"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering! While I do like the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a significantly lower offer ($60) than our maximum budget ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains courteous and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our price target. 
* **Strategic Aim:**  This offer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a baseline for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $85 is still above our maximum budget of $80.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is showing willingness to negotiate by moving almost halfway from her initial offer. This suggests there's still room to bring the price down further. 
* **John as Backup:** We have the security of buying from John at $80 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $70. Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving closer to our maximum budget in smaller increments ($10 this round) to signal seriousness while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Transparency:** By being upfront about our budget being closer to $70, we're hoping to encourage Alice to make a more realistic offer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We continue to be polite and express appreciation for Alice's flexibility to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $77.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginally Better, Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $77.50 is a slight improvement, but it remains above our $70 target and our absolute $80 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we're testing Alice's resolve and seeing how low she's willing to go. There's a chance she might accept our previous offer of $70 in the next round.
* **John Option Still Viable:**  We haven't reached our limit with Alice, but the safety net of buying from John at $80 ensures we won't be pressured into overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $77.50 is close, but I'm really trying to stay closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $70? If so, I'm ready to make the purchase today."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiteration and Finality:** We're reiterating our $70 offer, making it clear this is our target price.  Adding ""ready to make the purchase today"" emphasizes our seriousness if she accepts.
* **Slight Pressure:** By not budging and holding our ground, we apply a subtle pressure on Alice, potentially leading her to accept the $70 to close the deal.
* **Alternative Ready:**  We're still prepared to buy from John for $80 if Alice remains inflexible. This approach maximizes our chances of getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $79.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has explicitly stated that $79.50 is her lowest price.  
* **Minimal Savings:**  While $79.50 is slightly less than John's $80, the difference is negligible, especially considering the time and effort already invested in negotiating with Alice. 
* **Time to Move On:** We've negotiated fairly and reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to result in significant savings. It's more efficient to secure the product from John at our desired price point."
