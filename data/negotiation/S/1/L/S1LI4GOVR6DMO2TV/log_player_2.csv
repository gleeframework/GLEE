Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's not worth accepting at this stage. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product looks interesting, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1500000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while recognizing your budgetary constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again.  However, if I don't get a price closer to my target, I might consider buying from John as I'm already three rounds in."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,500,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given my budget and your need to make a profit. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
