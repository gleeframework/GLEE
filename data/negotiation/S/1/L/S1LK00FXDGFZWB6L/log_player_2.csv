# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I suggest we discuss a price that reflects its worth while ensuring it's within your budget. Considering the product's value to you is $100, I propose an offer of $95. This allows for a fair transaction that benefits both parties. Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you have any other suggestions.
