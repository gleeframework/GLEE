Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and potential. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with an offer equal to your guaranteed sale price ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor.  Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this immediately positions the product as high-value.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price, potentially swaying Bob despite his initial valuation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is risky. If Bob is turned off by the high initial price, you miss out on potential negotiation within the $800,000 - $1,000,000 range. 
* A more flexible approach could involve a slightly lower initial offer with room for negotiation, ensuring you stay above your minimum acceptable price."
