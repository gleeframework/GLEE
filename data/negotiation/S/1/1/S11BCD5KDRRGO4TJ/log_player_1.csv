Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob likely expects to pay less than the full $1,000,000 it's worth to him, so this offer gives him space to counter without feeling like you're being unreasonable. 
* **It sets a strong initial position:** Starting with a higher offer shows confidence and may encourage Bob to come closer to your desired price.

**Remember:** This is just the first step in the negotiation. Be prepared to respond to Bob's counteroffers or make your own if necessary."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit too expensive for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than what John is offering.  There's no reason to accept it at this stage.  It's time to try and get a better deal from Bob."
