{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and the negotiation has been going on for a few rounds.  There is a chance Alice might lower the price further, but Bob is starting to run out of time. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not getting the product at all is increasing.  At this point, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John and secure the product at his maximum budget."
