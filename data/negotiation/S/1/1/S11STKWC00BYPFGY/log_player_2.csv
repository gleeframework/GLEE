"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  There's no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price, so negotiating could lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to negotiate further. If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds based on her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is closer to my target, but I'll continue trying to get closer to my desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I want to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target.  This counteroffer is a good middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise."
