"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and allows me to see how interested Bob is in the product. If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his maximum price and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. There's a chance I can negotiate a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to raise his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It also gives me some room to move down in price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good price, closer to my ideal than my initial $10,000.  It's getting late in the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale. I'll accept his offer and secure a profitable sale."
