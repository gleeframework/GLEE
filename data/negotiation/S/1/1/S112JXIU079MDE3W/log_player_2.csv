It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a lower price.  You're already saving $500 compared to buying from John, but there's potential to save even more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is only $200 more than your last offer.  At this point, it's likely you won't get a better price, and accepting saves you $800 compared to John."
