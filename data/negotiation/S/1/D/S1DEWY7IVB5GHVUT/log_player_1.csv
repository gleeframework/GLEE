{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's not a ""take it or leave it"" offer, which might make Bob more likely to counter.
* **It's significantly less than your minimum:**  This gives you room to potentially make concessions if needed, while still securing a profit.

Remember, the key is to be flexible but firm, and to keep in mind that you always have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  If he's not willing to budge, I'll always have John as a backup buyer."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's keep talking!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While Bob has moved a little closer to my desired price, it's still far below what I consider fair.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to bridge the gap further. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target without risking losing the sale completely."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference again and settle on $9,000.
