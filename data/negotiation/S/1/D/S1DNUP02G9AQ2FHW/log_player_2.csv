"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is a good starting point, but you can potentially get a better deal.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is happy to sell for $8,000. 
* **Negotiation is a good strategy.** You have 10 rounds to potentially get closer to Alice's desired price.

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to the middle ground."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a strong opening move, showing Alice you're serious about a good price. It's also relatively close to the middle ground between your $12,000 maximum and Alice's $8,000 minimum.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  This price gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. 

**Strategy:**  By starting with a strong counteroffer, you set the tone for the negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will accept, but if not, you'll have room to adjust your offer in the next round."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial offer.**  This shows she's willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **You still have room to negotiate a better price.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is happy to sell for $8,000. 

**Next Steps:** 
You should make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly lower than Alice's latest offer. This will show her you're serious about getting a good deal, but you're also willing to meet halfway."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,500. It shows a willingness to compromise and signals that you're taking her offer seriously.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While you're moving closer to Alice's desired price, you're still leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**  By consistently adjusting your offers and showing flexibility, you're increasing the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your preferred price.**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is still asking for more than $9,000, which was a good starting point for a middle ground.
* **You still have a few rounds left to negotiate a better price.**  There's still room for compromise, and you can use the remaining rounds to try to get closer to your target.

**Next Steps:** 
You should make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly lower than Alice's latest offer. This will show her you're serious about getting a good deal, but you're also willing to meet halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer is a slight increase from your previous counteroffer of $9,000, showing Alice you're willing to budge but not drastically. It's also still below her current offer of $9,750.
* **Maintaining Distance:** This keeps you within a reasonable range of your $12,000 maximum. You don't want to give up too much too soon.

**Strategy:** By gradually increasing your offer while staying within your budget, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining your bargaining power. Hopefully, Alice will recognize the compromise you're making and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your maximum.**  While $9,900 is not ideal, it's still within your budget. However, with a few rounds remaining, there's still room for negotiation.
* **You have some leverage left.**  You can still counteroffer and potentially push Alice closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:** 
You should make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price slightly lower than Alice's latest offer. This will show her you're serious about getting a good deal but are also willing to meet halfway. Consider offering $9,500 or $9,600 as a potential counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Further:** This counteroffer is a significant move towards Alice's offer, demonstrating your commitment to closing the deal. It's a good middle ground between her last offer of $9,900 and your previous counteroffer of $9,250.
* **Maintaining a Gap:** While it's close to Alice's price, it still leaves room for her to counter without feeling like she's conceding too much. This keeps some negotiating power for the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:** With only two rounds left, this offer shows your willingness to close the deal, but it also keeps the pressure on Alice to come down slightly. This move could potentially force Alice to accept or make a final counteroffer close to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting too high.** $10,200 is significantly closer to your maximum price of $12,000, and it leaves very little room for further negotiation.
* **There's only one round left.**  You're running out of time, and Alice is showing no signs of backing down from her high price. 
* **Jhon's offer is still a better deal.** Although buying from Jhon is the most expensive option, it's still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer at this stage. 

**Strategy:**  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John. The potential savings of a few hundred dollars in the final round are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up with no product at all."
