{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also frames the offer as a good deal, encouraging Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
