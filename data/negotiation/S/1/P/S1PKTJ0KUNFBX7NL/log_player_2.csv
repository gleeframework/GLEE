"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very aggressive counteroffer.  Since Alice's offer was far above my budget, I'm trying to see if she's willing to come down significantly. It's highly unlikely she'll accept this offer, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my preferred price point. I want to see if I can get her even lower.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to overpay.  I'm hoping this will lead to a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm getting closer to my desired price point, but I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push before considering buying from John. I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and it's unlikely Alice will come down much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but we are running out of rounds. It's unlikely she will come down further, especially since she has consistently rejected my counteroffers. Buying from John guarantees me the product at my maximum budget, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to another buyer."
