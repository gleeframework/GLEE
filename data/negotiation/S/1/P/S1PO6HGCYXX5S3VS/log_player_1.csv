"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to make a deal, $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I have 9 more rounds to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider at this time. However, I am still interested in finding a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it reflects my desire to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is within my acceptable range and I'm confident I can still make a good profit.  It's better to secure the deal than risk further negotiation or a lower offer from John."
