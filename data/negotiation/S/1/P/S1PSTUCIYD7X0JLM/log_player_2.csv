Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $10,200. It's the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the $10,200 offer saves you $800 compared to John's price, which is a reasonable saving.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome and risks pushing Alice away."
