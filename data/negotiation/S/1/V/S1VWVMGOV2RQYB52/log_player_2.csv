"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $60. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $60 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While $60 is a good starting point, I'm only able to spend $50 right now. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $50 is a bit tight for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I offer it to you for $65? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $80. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $65.
* **Potential Savings:**  Accepting this offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or raise her price. At this point, $65 is a good deal for Bob."
