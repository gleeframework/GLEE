Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit more than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a lot lower than that. Would you consider $8,000?  That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
