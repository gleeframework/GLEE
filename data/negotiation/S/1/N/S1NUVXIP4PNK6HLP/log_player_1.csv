Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,150,000. This is a unique product that offers significant value, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an ""opportunity"" for Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** I make a profit of $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Bob negotiates:**  We can potentially settle on a price that's mutually beneficial, but still above $1,200,000 for me. 
* **Bob rejects:** I sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
