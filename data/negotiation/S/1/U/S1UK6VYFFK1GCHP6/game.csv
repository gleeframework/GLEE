"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
