"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I'm choosing a price that is a bit higher than my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is interested. It leaves room for negotiation if he counters, and I'll use the information from his response to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counter with $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer.  While $130 is still below my initial asking price, it's a fair compromise and gets me closer to my minimum desired value.  There's always a risk of losing the sale completely, and with 6 rounds left, I want to ensure I secure a reasonable price."
