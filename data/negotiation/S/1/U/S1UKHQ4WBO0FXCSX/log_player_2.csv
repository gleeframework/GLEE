Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, but I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.

**Reasoning:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While closer to my budget, her final price of $1,250,000 is still above what John is offering. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at $1,200,000 and avoid further negotiation."
