"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
