"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I believe it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's important to exhaust negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still well above the product's value to Alice and leaves significant room for further negotiation.
* **There's still potential for a better price.**  I'm willing to continue negotiations to see if I can get a price closer to my target. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** I'll explore further counteroffers before resorting to John's higher price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my target price.**  While it's slightly higher than my last counteroffer, it's within a reasonable range and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Further negotiation might not be fruitful.**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing further.
* **Buying from John is still a much worse option.**  Accepting Alice's offer will save me over $600,000 compared to buying from John. 

Considering the value of the product and the potential cost of buying from John, accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario."
