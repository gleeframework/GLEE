Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $200, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer based on how close it is to my desired price. If it's too low, I'll counter with a slightly lower price. If he refuses to negotiate, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity to counter:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $150.  I'll also need to consider how determined Bob seems to be. If he seems inflexible, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $170.  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is reasonable:**  $170 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive and friendly:**  I'm keeping the tone positive to maintain a good relationship.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John.  If he accepts, great! If he counters, I'll consider his offer and decide how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $155. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  Trying to squeeze out a few more dollars might not be worth the risk of losing the sale completely. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I'm risking selling to John for $150, which is only a small increase.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $155. This ensures a sale and keeps a decent profit margin."
