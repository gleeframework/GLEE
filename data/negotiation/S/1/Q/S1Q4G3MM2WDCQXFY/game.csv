"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its potential value to you, I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while leaving room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am looking to keep my investment within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,325,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  To bridge the gap, how about $1,340,000?  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
