{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its potential value to you, I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while leaving room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am looking to keep my investment within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately below what I'm able to accept at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. This offers a compromise that respects both our financial positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm also considering the potential of selling to John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,325,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  To bridge the gap, how about $1,340,000?  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on our previous exchanges, I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000. This offers a reasonable compromise while keeping my investment within my desired budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is getting very close to my desired price range.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,400,000, accepting this offer is still a good outcome and allows me to close the deal without risking losing out completely.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident I can make a good profit from this transaction."
