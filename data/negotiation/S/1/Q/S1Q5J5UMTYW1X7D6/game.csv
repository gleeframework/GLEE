,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
