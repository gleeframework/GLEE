"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I know you're interested, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as fair, there's no room for negotiation in her statement. Since you know John is willing to sell the product for the same price, you lose nothing by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can get a better deal from John."
