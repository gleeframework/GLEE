,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $108 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ $109.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still not comfortable with $109. Would you be willing to meet me at $106? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",106.0,Bob,6,
