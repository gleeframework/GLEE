Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Strong but Fair Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price without being overly aggressive.  It aims to make Bob feel he's getting a reasonable deal even at a premium.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, the approach might differ."
