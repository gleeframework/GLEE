Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so anything above that is a win.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (what Bob is willing to pay) and any price above $1,200,000 (what you're willing to accept).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Targeting the ZOPA:**  $1,050,000 falls within the ZOPA, offering potential for agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While starting above Bob's valuation, the offer leaves space for potential counter-offers.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** The offer aims to secure a significant profit while not appearing unreasonably high to deter Bob.

**Important Note:** Bob might outright reject this initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate.  You can always slightly lower your price if needed, but never go below your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
