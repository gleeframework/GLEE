"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is a good fit, I'm hoping to purchase it for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done on the market.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",825000.0,Alice,5,
