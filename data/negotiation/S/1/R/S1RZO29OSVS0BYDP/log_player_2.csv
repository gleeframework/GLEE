"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. While buying from John for $10,000 is an option, it's less desirable than potentially getting a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is still a profitable deal for Alice, as it's above her value of $8,000. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This offer gives Bob a strong chance of getting a good deal without completely alienating Alice."
