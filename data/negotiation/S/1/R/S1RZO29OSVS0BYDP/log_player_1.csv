Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that Bob values the product higher than you do, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and it's a good deal considering his initial rejection.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John."
