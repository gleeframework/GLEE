"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is a great opportunity for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but I'm still not able to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $887,500. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures that we both get a reasonable deal. Let's make this happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $887,500. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $850,000 is a bit too low, but I could do $855,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",855000.0,Bob,6,
