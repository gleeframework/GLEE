Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $950,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves a good margin for me.
* **Appeal to his interest:**  Highlighting the potential profit for Bob makes the offer more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates I'm open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so there's no risk in offering a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything below $900,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can potentially get closer to my target price if I continue negotiating. 
* **Safety net:**  I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Empathy:** Acknowledging Bob's budget constraints builds rapport and shows that I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the ""opportunity"" and ""common ground"" positions the offer as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Openness:** The message conveys a desire to continue negotiating, leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Note:** This counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not enough:** $875,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $900,000. 
* **Potential for a better outcome:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price. 
* **Safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  This gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $900,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but I'm still not able to go as low as $875,000.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows a genuine willingness to compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""reasonable deal"" positions the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""making this happen"" subtly conveys a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Final offer?:** This offer is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer. I'll decide whether to accept Bob's next offer or sell to John based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not worth the risk:** Bob's final offer of $855,000 is still significantly below my desired price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, which may not be worth it considering my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a substantial profit and minimizes risk.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, selling to John ensures I reach my financial goals."
