Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go down to $115, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115, and it's a reasonable price compared to your $150 alternative. Taking the deal now guarantees you get the product at a good price."
