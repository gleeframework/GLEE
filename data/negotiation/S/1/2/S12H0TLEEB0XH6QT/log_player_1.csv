Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is quite steep. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit rich for me.  I could potentially stretch to $750,000, but that's truly my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet the minimum value of the product for Alice.  While there are rounds left, his incremental increases don't suggest he'll suddenly jump to a significantly higher offer. Accepting John's offer ensures Alice gets her minimum acceptable price."
