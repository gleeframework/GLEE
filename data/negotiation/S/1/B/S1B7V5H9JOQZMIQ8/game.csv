"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,400,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's my firm offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. My revised offer is $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
