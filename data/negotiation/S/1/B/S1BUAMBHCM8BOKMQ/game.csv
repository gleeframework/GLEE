,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product and think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 90. How about we meet in the middle at 110? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $100, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as 100. I've already compromised a lot, and I think 110 is the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try 105?",105.0,Alice,5,
