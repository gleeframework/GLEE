"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's risky to accept Bob's offer of $120 right now, as that's significantly below your minimum.  There's a chance we can get closer to our desired price with further negotiation.  We have plenty of rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $135 is closer to our minimum, there's still room for negotiation. We have more rounds and can likely get a better price.  It's also good to remember that John is willing to pay $150, which is a good safety net if we can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $145. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $140 is just above our minimum and a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal for both of us.  It's also worth noting that we're nearing the end of our rounds, and selling to John for $150 is still an option."
