"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  Rejecting the offer is the best choice, as you can now try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't afford $2,000,000. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which is the maximum I can pay.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest price I can offer while still covering my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  You're comfortable paying $800,000, and there's no need to go higher. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating or buy from John if the negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. This is my final counteroffer. I believe the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. If you're still interested, let's discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  It's time to cut your losses and move on. You've made it clear you're willing to pay up to $800,000, but Alice is unwilling to budge further.  It's better to buy from John for $800,000 than to keep haggling with Alice."
