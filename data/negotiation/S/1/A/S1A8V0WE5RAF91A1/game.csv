"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $820000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident that you'll find it a great deal.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $760000?  I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.  Let's make this happen.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $760000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $810000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $810000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $780000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. It's a win-win for both of us.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $780000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $830000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",830000.0,Alice,7,
