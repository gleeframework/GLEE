Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" is still significantly higher than John's price. It's unlikely she'll come close enough to your $800,000 limit in the remaining rounds.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you stay within budget."
