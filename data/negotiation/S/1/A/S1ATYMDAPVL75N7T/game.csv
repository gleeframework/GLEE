"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a significantly lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the worth of this product. Would you consider $1,900,000?  This is a substantial reduction and a fair offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I need a price that works for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
