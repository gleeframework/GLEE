Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider a significantly lower price of $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

We're still too far apart. Bob's offer is increasing, but we have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can draw him closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing $1,600,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but I need to see some movement on your end as well.  This is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```

We're getting closer, but $900,000 is still too low. We need to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial jump while still showing a willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can use the remaining rounds to our advantage."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's bridge this gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Compromise:** We've made a substantial drop from our previous offer, showing Bob we are willing to negotiate but standing firm on a price that is still profitable for us. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds and need to incentivize Bob to make a substantial counter-offer quickly.
* **Backup Option:** We still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't accept this offer, so we maintain a strong position."
