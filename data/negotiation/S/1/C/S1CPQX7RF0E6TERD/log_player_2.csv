(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest and see if she's willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer but still potentially attractive to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price point while still demonstrating my willingness to compromise."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my desired price point, and we are already halfway through the rounds.  It's a good deal for me, and accepting it secures the product.  If I continue negotiating, there is a risk that I might not be able to secure the product at a good price or at all."
