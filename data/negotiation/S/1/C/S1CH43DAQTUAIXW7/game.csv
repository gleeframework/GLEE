"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we meet in the middle of $110 and $90, which would be $100? That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,4,
