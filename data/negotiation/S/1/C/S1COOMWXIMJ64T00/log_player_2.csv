Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the value I think the product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a good compromise.
