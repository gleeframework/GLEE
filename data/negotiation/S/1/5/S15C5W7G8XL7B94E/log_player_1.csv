Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a backup buyer at $80, ensuring you don't make a loss."
