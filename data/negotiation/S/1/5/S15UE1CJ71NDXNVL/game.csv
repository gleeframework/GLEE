"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $12,000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,3,
