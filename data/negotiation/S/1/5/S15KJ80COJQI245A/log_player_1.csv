Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's above my minimum value of $10,000, leaving room to potentially go lower if needed.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and inviting, emphasizing the product's uniqueness to pique Bob's interest.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price. If he rejects, I can then use his counteroffer to determine his true value for the product and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly.  Always remember,  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum value, I'm not yet ready to accept it. Here's why:

* **Potential for higher value:** Bob showed interest, suggesting he values the product. There's a chance I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting his initial offer allows me to gauge how committed Bob is to acquiring the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a higher offer.
* **Negotiation is key:** The goal is to maximize profit.  A little back-and-forth can often lead to a better deal for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This will show that I'm willing to negotiate while also demonstrating that the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 doesn't quite reflect its true value. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing that the product has a higher value.  Proposing a middle ground shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Price:**  $12,500 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my position:** The price is still above my minimum, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price.
* **Show flexibility:** The compromise shows that I'm open to negotiation and willing to meet halfway.
* **Encourage further negotiations:** It's likely Bob will counter again, providing more information about his maximum value. 

I'm confident that this strategy will lead to a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  considering these factors:

* **Bob's commitment:** He's demonstrated interest and has moved closer to my price point.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's a chance that if I reject his offer, Bob might not counter again, or he might walk away completely.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, but it could also delay the sale and potentially lead to a lower price in the end.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 is the most logical choice at this point. It ensures a sale at a price that is just above my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
