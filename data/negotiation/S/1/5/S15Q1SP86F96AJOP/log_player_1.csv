Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a strong price that's closer to your target.  It leaves room for some negotiation but  indicates you're serious about getting a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what you initially offered, but it's still above John's price, so it's worth negotiating further. You'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

You're dropping your price slightly, but still holding firm above Bob's offer.  This shows you're willing to compromise, but are not willing to give away too much of your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now equal to what John is offering. There's no further room for negotiation to increase your profit. It's best to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."
