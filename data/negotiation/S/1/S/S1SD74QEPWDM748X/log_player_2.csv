"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you, and I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for your business, while still giving me a strong return. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's serious intention to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price, emphasizing fairness.
* **Room for compromise:** This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to counter back, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While Alice has lowered her price, there's still a gap between her offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's ideal price. It's worth trying to get a lower price.
* **Time pressure:** Bob has limited rounds, but there's enough time to continue negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, Bob should counter with a price slightly higher than $1,200,000, aiming to meet Alice in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,250,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Bob's counteroffer is the midpoint between Alice's last offer ($1,300,000) and his previous offer ($1,200,000). This shows a genuine effort to reach a compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  Bob emphasizes the ""fair"" and ""satisfying"" aspects of the offer.
* **Maintaining pressure:** This counteroffer is still lower than Alice's offer,  keeping the pressure on her to find a mutually agreeable price."
