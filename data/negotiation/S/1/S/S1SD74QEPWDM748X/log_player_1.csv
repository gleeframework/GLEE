Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
