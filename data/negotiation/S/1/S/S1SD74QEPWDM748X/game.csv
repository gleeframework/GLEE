"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you, and I'd like to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for your business, while still giving me a strong return. Let's discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,250,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
