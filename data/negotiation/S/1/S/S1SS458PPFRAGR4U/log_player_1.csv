Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $180 might be a bit high for your budget, Bob. However, $100 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Bob will go much higher than $115. Taking the guaranteed $150 from John is the best decision at this point."
