"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'd get elsewhere.  Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I can offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering what I've seen elsewhere. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be within my budget of $1,000,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering your budget and my desired price. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
