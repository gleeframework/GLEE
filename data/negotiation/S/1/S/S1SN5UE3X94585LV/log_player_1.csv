Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'd get elsewhere.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I can offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering what I've seen elsewhere. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be within my budget of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price. I have 8 rounds left to try and close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering your budget and my desired price. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is within my minimum acceptable range and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to secure a sale now than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
