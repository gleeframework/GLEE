"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and your asking price. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already selling it below what it's worth to me. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
