"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start strong to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my original price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is a slight decrease from my original offer, but still gives me a good profit while being more appealing to Bob.  I'm also trying to keep the negotiation positive by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to give up much more profit at this point. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $87 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm trying to find a happy medium with Bob, offering a compromise that's closer to his offer but still within a profitable range for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go that high, but I'll meet you at $86 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly stubborn, and I'm running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, which is better than risking losing everything."
