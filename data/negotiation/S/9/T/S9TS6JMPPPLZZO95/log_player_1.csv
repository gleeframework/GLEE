Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my goal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,050,000. This offer still gives you a substantial savings compared to my original offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that we are not going to come to an agreement that benefits me. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, who is guaranteed to give me the price I need."
