Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still securing a significant profit.
* **Strong Starting Point:** Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Alternative Secured:** Knowing John will buy it for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. I won't accept anything less than that from Bob."
