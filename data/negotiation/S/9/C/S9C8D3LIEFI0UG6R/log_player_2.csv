"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than Bob's budget, and he can get the same product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, making this offer not worthwhile.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,500. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
