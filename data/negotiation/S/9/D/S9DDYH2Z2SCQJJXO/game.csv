"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $8,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Bob,4,
