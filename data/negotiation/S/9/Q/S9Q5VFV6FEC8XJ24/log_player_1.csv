Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but it allows for room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm concerned that I might not get a better offer in the next round.  Also, I'm risking losing the deal completely and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale for $11,000."
