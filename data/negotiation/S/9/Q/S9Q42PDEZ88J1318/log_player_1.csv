Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving some room for negotiation. It also provides a good starting point, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but lower than my original price, indicating flexibility.  It's a compromise that shows I'm serious about selling to Bob while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed higher price."
