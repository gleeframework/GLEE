Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves you room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price later if Bob's counteroffer is too low or if you feel pressured by John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your value for the product is higher, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my target by counteroffering.  I'm also not desperate, as I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000.  This gives me leverage to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to get closer to my own needs. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go beyond $8,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he won't budge on his $8,000 offer.  This is well below my minimum of $12,000.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a much lower price from Bob.  I've negotiated with Bob, but it's time to move on and secure the best deal possible."
