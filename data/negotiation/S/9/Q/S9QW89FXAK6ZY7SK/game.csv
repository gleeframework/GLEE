"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your value for the product is higher, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to get closer to my own needs. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
