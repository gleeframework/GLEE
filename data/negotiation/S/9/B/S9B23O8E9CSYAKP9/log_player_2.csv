Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm extending this opportunity to you for $100. This price reflects the product's worth and the quality you can expect.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, I'm confident that she's willing to make a profit, and I'm not sure if $100 is the best price I can get. I'd like to explore other options.
