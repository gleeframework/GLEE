Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering its potential benefits.  Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming for a price between these figures is key.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""fair offer"" to make the price more palatable to Bob.

**It's important to note:**  This is just an opening offer. Bob's response might require further negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
