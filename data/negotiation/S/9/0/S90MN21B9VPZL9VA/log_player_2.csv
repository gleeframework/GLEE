{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $800,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $950,000. It's better to counteroffer Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $850,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and still within my budget. I believe this is a fair price considering I can purchase the product for $800,000 from John if this negotiation fails."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to my budget but still higher than what I can get from John.  I will counteroffer again, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $875,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it's still below what I can pay John. I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough for Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."
