"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can discuss further!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to considering $7,000? That would work for me, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can finalize the deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
