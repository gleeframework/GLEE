"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to strike a balance:

* **Reasonable Reduction:**  It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but not so low that it's likely to offend her.
* **Shows Serious Interest:** Offering a specific price demonstrates a genuine interest in purchasing the product. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It's unlikely Alice will accept $85 immediately, but it opens the door for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my target, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $88? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Small Increment:** By suggesting $88, we're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($85) and Alice's current offer ($92). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone encourages continued negotiation. 
* **Deadline Awareness (Implied):** We're getting closer to my alternative option of buying from John for $120.  While not explicitly stated, Alice might sense the narrowing window for reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $90. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has presented her ""final offer."" While I could try to push for a few more dollars off, the difference is minimal at this point. Accepting $90 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down entirely."
