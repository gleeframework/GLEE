"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's likely room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, you can try to lower the price further.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation rounds and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $650,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm willing to pay, given the product's value to me.  I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is a good deal for me. It's lower than my initial counteroffer, and it's significantly less than what I'd pay John.  I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product."
