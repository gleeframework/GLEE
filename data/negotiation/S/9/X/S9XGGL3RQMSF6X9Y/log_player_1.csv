Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $1,100,000, which reflects its significant value. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Create urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (John) might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept a higher price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $1,200,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
