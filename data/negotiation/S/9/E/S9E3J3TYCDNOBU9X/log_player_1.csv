"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $22,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  This reflects its quality and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly anchored at $12,000 and isn't budging.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get me closer to my $15,000 minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk more time and potentially get stuck at an even lower price with Bob."
