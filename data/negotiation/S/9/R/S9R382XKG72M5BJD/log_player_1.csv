"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room there is for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me and the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,300,000 at this point. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a decent profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm getting closer to my minimum desired price, but I'm still not satisfied with this offer.  I believe there's still room for Bob to go higher, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding firm on my desired price.  I believe this price is reasonable and fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is very close to my desired price, and I'm running out of time. I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to close the deal."
