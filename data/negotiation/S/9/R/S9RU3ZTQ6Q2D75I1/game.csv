"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that you're not serious about selling this product to me at a good price. I'm willing to walk away and buy it from John for $80 if you're not willing to meet me at a reasonable price. My final offer is $92. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm not getting any closer to a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $80. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from John for $80. I'm not willing to go any higher.",80.0,Bob,8,
