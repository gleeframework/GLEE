"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $750,000. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
