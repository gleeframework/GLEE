{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, knowing that I can always drop it later if needed. I also want to make it clear that I have another buyer lined up, which might encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob, or I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $95 is the best I can do right now.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price, but still lower than my minimum.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to my desired $100, Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise and above my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm accepting his offer to avoid potentially losing the sale and having to sell to John for the same price."
