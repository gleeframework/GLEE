"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $950,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to offer $1,010,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value it brings to my business and represents a significant investment on my part. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
