"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $2,000,000 to you, and I'm offering it for $1,750,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product. You know you can get it for $1,500,000 from John, which is the maximum you're willing to pay.  There's no point in even trying to negotiate with Alice."
