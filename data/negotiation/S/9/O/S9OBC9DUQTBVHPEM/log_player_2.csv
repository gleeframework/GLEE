"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's potential to negotiate further and save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still within your budget of $1,000,000. This is a good compromise, and it's likely you won't get a much better price from Alice. Accepting her offer allows you to secure the product and start using it sooner rather than risking further negotiation with Alice or potentially going with John's higher offer."
