"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $14,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm hoping to get it for a bit less, though. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I think my initial offer of $14,000 was already quite competitive. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise.  It's a lower price than John's offer, and it's a better deal than Alice's previous offer. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and secure the product."
