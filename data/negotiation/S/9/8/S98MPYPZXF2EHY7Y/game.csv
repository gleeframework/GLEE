"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from this product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. Could you consider selling the product to me for $115? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $123. It's still a great price, and I think it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll sell it to you.",123.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I am still unable to meet you at $123. I would like to propose a final offer of $118. This price aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",118.0,Bob,6,
