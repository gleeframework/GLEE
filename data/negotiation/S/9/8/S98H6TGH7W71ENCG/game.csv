"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the price further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way out of my budget.  I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the considerable value this product will bring to your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider $700,000. This offer reflects a significant investment on my part and acknowledges the product's potential.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but my goal is to reach a fair agreement. While $700,000 is still too low, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This revised offer significantly closes the gap between our valuations and represents a strong commitment to getting this deal done.  What are your thoughts on this?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but we still have some ground to cover. I can go up to $750,000. However, that's my absolute limit.  It's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",750000.0,Bob,6,
