{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This price is a starting point that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but also lower than what I'd get from John ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages a conversation. It highlights the value for Bob while leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a better price than Bob's initial value:** $1,200,000 is closer to my desired outcome than $800,000.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me more leverage.
* **Keep John as a backup:** The threat of selling to John provides a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than my desired price and well below what John is willing to pay. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Continue negotiating:** I can explore if there's room for further negotiation with Bob to get closer to my desired price.
* **Leverage John's offer:**  Having John as a backup buyer strengthens my position in the negotiation with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and increase the chances of achieving a more favorable outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit far from my desired price point.  To make this work, I'd need to see $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** $1,050,000 is a compromise. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer and my backup price from John. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints. It also encourages continued negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, potentially making him more willing to consider it.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The price is still above Bob's initial offer, giving me some bargaining power.
* **Signal flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to compromise can help secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've considered your latest offer, but unfortunately, it still exceeds my budget. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a compromise. This amount reflects the value I believe the product holds for me while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John ($1,500,000).  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiation:** I can try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The threat of selling to John gives me a stronger bargaining position.
* **Avoid settling for less:**  $1,000,000 is a decent amount, but it's not a deal-breaker for me. 

I believe I can potentially secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from a price that works for me.  To make this deal happen, I'd need to see $1,025,000.  It's a fair amount that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** $1,025,000 is a small increase from Bob's offer but still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. It also signals a willingness to be flexible.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  The price is very close to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintain leverage:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, giving me some bargaining power.
* **Signal commitment:** Demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway can help secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've evaluated your latest proposal, and while I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet your requested price. I am willing to offer $1,010,000 for the product. This amount is a reasonable compromise between our positions and should allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,010,000 is very close to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify walking away from John's offer of $1,500,000. The potential profit margin with John is much higher, and I don't want to risk missing out on that opportunity. 

Therefore, it makes more sense to sell the product to John. This ensures I get the maximum possible value for the product and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
