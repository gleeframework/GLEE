"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good compromise between my minimum desired price ($100) and Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($150). It also opens the conversation with a friendly message to establish rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to give up any potential profit at this stage. I still believe I can get a better price, especially since Bob has expressed interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $110 to close this deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
