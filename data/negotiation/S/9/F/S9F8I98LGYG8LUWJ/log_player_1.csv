Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000, meaning she won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 to John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to maximize her profit by offering the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This ensures Bob is likely to accept while still netting Alice a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know you see its value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  The message is crafted to be positive and highlight the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, making it highly likely he'll accept. Alice secures a profit of $450,000, which is significantly more than her guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation skills or alternative options. In a real-world scenario, additional factors might influence the offer."
