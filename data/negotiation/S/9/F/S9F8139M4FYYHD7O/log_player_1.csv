This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation, and I'm ready to see if Bob is interested in this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I believe I can still get closer to my target of $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm adjusting my offer to $950,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This compromise shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
