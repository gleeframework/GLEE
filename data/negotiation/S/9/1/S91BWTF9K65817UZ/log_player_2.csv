"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your needs. This exceptional item holds a significant value to me, reflecting years of expertise and innovation. Given its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this transaction. Considering its intrinsic value and your anticipated use, I suggest we aim for a price closer to $12,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects the product's value while being favorable to you. Let's schedule a call to delve deeper into this opportunity and explore if we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  While her message tries to position the price as fair, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding with your backup plan to buy from John."
