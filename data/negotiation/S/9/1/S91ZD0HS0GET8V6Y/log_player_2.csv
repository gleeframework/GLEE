"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  A low starting offer might prompt Alice to counter with a price closer to her minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $60 is a significant jump down from $90. While it might seem low, it establishes a strong bargaining position and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice only came down by $5, indicating she might not be very flexible.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're still significantly below John's offer of $100. It's worth pushing a bit more to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both want to find a fair price, Alice. How about $70? That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We want to demonstrate willingness to negotiate by increasing our offer significantly, but not too close to $85.
* **Justification:**  By acknowledging Alice's desire for a fair price and highlighting our compromise, we aim to keep the negotiation amicable and encourage a counteroffer. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to John's fallback option ($100).  While we have time, we don't want to drag the negotiation out unnecessarily."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Holdout:**  While $75 is a decent price, we are now very close to Alice's likely minimum. By rejecting this offer, we put pressure on Alice to potentially offer a final concession.
* **Risk Assessment:**  The risk of losing the deal is relatively low at this point. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we are still well below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close to a number I can work with. How about we split the difference and call it $72? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 72
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're aiming for that sweet spot between our target price and what we believe Alice is willing to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While we're not explicitly mentioning a deadline,  phrasing like ""a number I can work with"" subtly implies that we're nearing the end of our negotiation window.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting a split, we maintain a collaborative tone and give Alice a clear, easy-to-accept solution."
