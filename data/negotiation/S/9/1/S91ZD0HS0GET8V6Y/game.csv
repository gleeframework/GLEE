"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we both want to find a fair price, Alice. How about $70? That's a significant move on my part, and it gets us closer to a deal.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close to a number I can work with. How about we split the difference and call it $72? That's a fair compromise.",72.0,Bob,6,
