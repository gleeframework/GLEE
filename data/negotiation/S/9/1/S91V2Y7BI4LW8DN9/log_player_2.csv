{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a lower price through negotiation. You're not losing anything by rejecting the offer as you have the option to buy from John for the same price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of our product and aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the bargaining power in your favor, allowing you to potentially achieve a lower price. You can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your initial $80."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $95 is still a bit higher than what I'm looking for. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $87.50.
