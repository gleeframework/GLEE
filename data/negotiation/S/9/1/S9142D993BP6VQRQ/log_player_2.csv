"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Realistic:** $13,000 is still above Alice's minimum but within Bob's budget, making it a reasonable starting point.
* **Openness:** The message encourages continued dialogue and leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He's already rejected a higher offer and shown willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting again and counter-offering leaves the door open for further price reduction before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $13,500? That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing a willingness to converge.
* **Fair Compromise:** It's a halfway point between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, signaling a desire to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging continued negotiation."
