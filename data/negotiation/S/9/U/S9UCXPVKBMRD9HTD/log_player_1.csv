Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to start with a higher offer to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""fair reflection of its worth"") makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still ensuring the sale of the product."
