"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above your counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $975,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,000,000 for this product. This is my final offer - I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
