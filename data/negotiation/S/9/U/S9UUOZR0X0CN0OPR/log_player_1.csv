Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. 
* I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm trying to get the best possible price. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk."
