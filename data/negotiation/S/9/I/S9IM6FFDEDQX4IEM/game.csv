"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to me, I'm prepared to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $725,000, which reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and a reasonable price for both of us. I'm confident this price will enable us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",725000.0,Bob,4,
