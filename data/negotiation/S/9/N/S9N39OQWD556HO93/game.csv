"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
