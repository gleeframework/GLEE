"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm sure you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a better price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down closer to your $1,000,000 limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value of the product to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better price to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should be fair to both of us, and I believe you'll find it a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum limit of $1,000,000. You have two options:

* **Negotiate further:** You can try to make another counteroffer to Alice, potentially a price slightly higher than your maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation as Alice already reduced her offer from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.
* **Buy from John:** If you feel Alice won't come down further, you can safely buy from John for your target price of $1,000,000.

Since negotiation is still a possibility, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to see if you can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000. However, I still need to get a better price to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has unfortunately gone back up to her original offer of $1,200,000.  This indicates she is unlikely to budge further.  Given your maximum budget is $1,000,000, it's no longer worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  

Therefore, the best decision is to accept John's offer and buy the product for $1,000,000.  This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice that is unlikely to result in a more favorable price."
