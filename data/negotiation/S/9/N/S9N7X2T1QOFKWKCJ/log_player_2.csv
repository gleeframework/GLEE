Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to get the product for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.

Alice is willing to meet you halfway, and you're still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best choice."
