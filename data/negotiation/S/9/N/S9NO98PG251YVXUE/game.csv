"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While I do believe the product is valuable, $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $9,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,000?  That's a good price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
