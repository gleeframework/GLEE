Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm aiming for a higher price than $1,200,000. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us. Let's try $1,250,000. This price acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.  How about $1,260,000? This is a reasonable price that shows we're both committed to making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John or continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a worse offer later."
