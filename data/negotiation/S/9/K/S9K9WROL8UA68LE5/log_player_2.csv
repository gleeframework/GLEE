"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a fair price. How about $1,400,000? It's a significant discount from the value you see in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** Bob has 10 rounds and a good starting point. There's potential to get a better price. 
* **John is an option:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,500,000 gives Bob a baseline and leverage."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's price but still higher than her minimum.  It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also shows he's serious about getting a good deal.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  Knowing John's price provides Bob with a fallback option if the negotiation fails."
