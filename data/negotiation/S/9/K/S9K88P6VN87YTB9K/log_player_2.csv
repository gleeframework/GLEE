# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. With its exceptional features and capabilities, it's truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am offering the product to you for $10,000. This price reflects the quality, functionality, and the significant savings compared to the market rate. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price, getting you closer to her $8,000 valuation. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer."
