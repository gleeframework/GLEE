Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is based on the assumption that the product could be worth more to Bob than $800,000 to me.  I'm hoping to get as close to the maximum value for Bob as possible, while still ensuring I get a better price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still a respectable amount for Bob. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still giving me a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is the same as John's, and it meets my minimum price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $800,000."
