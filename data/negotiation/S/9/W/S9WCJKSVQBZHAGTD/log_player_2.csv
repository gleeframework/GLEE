"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Accepting Alice's offer would cost $1,400,000.
* Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would cost $1,500,000.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the better choice as it allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller."
