"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit above its value to me. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further!",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15500?  That's still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Bob,4,
