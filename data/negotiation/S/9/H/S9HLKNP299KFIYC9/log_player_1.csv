{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still allows for potential negotiation. It also sets a positive tone and highlights the value proposition of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to Alice.  She's not desperate to sell and has a solid backup option with John.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives her a chance to try to get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than what Alice considers the product to be worth. While $9,800 is a bit more than the previous offer, it's not a substantial enough increase for Alice to continue negotiating.  Selling to John guarantees Alice her desired price and saves time and effort."
