Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I aim to maximize my profit. However, I am leaving room for negotiation, which is important to keep Bob engaged. If Bob rejects my offer, I can counter-offer and gradually lower the price if necessary, always keeping in mind my minimum selling price of $12,000.  

If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for my desired $12,000. This provides a safety net and prevents me from accepting an offer that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't go above $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum selling price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counter-offer with a price that is closer to my desired price point but still allows for some room for negotiation.  I will carefully consider Bob's initial response and his perceived value of the product when crafting my counteroffer.

If the negotiation with Bob continues to stall, I will exercise my option to sell the product to John for $12,000.  This ensures I do not settle for a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm offering you the product for $9,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's perceived value but still significantly higher than his initial offer. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum selling price.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and expresses willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value. This keeps the communication positive and encourages further dialogue.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise price, I aim to encourage Bob to reconsider his initial offer. The counteroffer is strategically positioned to give Bob a sense of progress without jeopardizing my financial goals. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess the situation and decide if I should continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer. While I understand your position, I still believe the product should be within my budget. I am willing to pay $9,000 for it. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's still less than ideal,  it's a good deal considering the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale and avoid potentially going through multiple rounds of counter-offers that could ultimately lead to a lower price or a stalled negotiation.  Selling to Bob for $9,000 is still a better outcome than risking a further decline in price or having to sell to John at a price I consider less favorable."
