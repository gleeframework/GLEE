Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above what Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate and incentivizes him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,000, I have room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **Importance of John:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:** I'm not desperate for a sale, and I know John is willing to pay my minimum, giving me leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $13,000 and $14,000, aiming to find a compromise closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I can't quite go down to $13,000. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and fairness.
* **Maintain Upper Hand:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, keeping some leverage. 
* **Towards my goal:** $13,500 is closer to my target of $15,000 than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've come down to $13,500, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for me. I've already spoken to another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to know if that's the best you can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:** Bob has revealed that John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.  This means Bob is likely bluffing about John's offer, as it would be illogical for John to sell for $12,000 when he could get $15,000 from me. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  Bob has been unwilling to budge much, and I'm already close to my minimum. 
* **Securing the Best Deal:** John is offering my minimum price, guaranteeing me the most profit.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, the risk of further negotiation and potential loss is too high.  I'll secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
