"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I can't quite go down to $13,000. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you've come down to $13,500, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for me. I've already spoken to another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to know if that's the best you can do.",13000.0,Bob,4,
