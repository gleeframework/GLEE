"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,600,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,525,000?",1525000.0,Bob,4,
