Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,750,000. I know it's a valuable item and I'm confident this price reflects its worth.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's worth, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,600,000?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,525,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is close enough to my minimum price that I'm willing to accept it. I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
