Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
