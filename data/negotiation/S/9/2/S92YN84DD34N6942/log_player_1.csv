{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. 

Here's why:

* **For me:** It's $2,000 more than I would get from John, a significant gain.
* **For Bob:** It's $2,000 less than what the product is worth to him, meaning he still gets a good deal.

While I could try for a higher price, risking Bob rejecting the offer, this offer offers the best chance of a successful sale and a good profit for me."
