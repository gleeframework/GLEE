Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth and sets a high bar for negotiations. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still making a profit well above your minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,000,000, so I'm offering $1,050,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a higher price.  At this point, I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **It's a small compromise:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **It's a reasonable offer:** $1,075,000 is halfway between my last offer and Bob's, making it a potentially acceptable middle ground. 
* **It's still above my minimum:** This ensures I'm still earning a decent profit. 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price of $1,050,000.  While this is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than what I initially hoped for and, after several rounds of negotiation, I'm not convinced he'll increase his offer further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
