"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its perceived value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value our negotiation, $12,375 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for a more mutually beneficial figure. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $12,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price,  $12,250 is a reasonable offer.  It's still above my minimum and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure this sale now rather than risk a worse outcome later."
