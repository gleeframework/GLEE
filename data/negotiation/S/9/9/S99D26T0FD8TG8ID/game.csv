"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to its perceived value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I value our negotiation, $12,375 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for a more mutually beneficial figure. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
