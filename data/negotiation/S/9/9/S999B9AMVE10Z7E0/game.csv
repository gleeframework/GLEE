"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a pretty good deal for this quality.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go higher than $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, and I want to be fair.  Let's make this our final price: $105.  It's a steal for this quality, and it avoids us going back and forth.",105.0,Alice,5,
