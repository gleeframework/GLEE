"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm explicitly mentioning the product's value to Bob to try and make him see the potential for a good deal.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  I'll keep John as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $120 to make this worthwhile for me. How about $115? "", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving Closer:** I'm dropping the price from $135 to $115, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to me to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's feedback to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise and is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid potentially losing more time with further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  $110 is a decent profit for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision in this situation. It allows me to secure a sale and avoid the potential of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
