You can likely get a better price than $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John. It's worth accepting the offer to save money."
