"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150."
