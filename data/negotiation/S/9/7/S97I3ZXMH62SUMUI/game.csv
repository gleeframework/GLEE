"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price. I could consider a price of $900,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $700,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $750,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
