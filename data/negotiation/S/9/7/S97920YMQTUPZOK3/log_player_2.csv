Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12000 is just too low for me. How about $16000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.

I'll make another counteroffer, but this time I'll try to be a bit more aggressive. I'll offer $13,000, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.
