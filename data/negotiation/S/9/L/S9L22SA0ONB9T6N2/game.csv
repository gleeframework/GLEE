"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $9,500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to making this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
