"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I've left some space for potential counteroffers, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important Note:**  While my goal is to earn as much as possible, I'm aware that there are 10 rounds and John is offering a solid backup option. This strategy allows me to explore a potential deal with Bob while keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about $9,500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 8 rounds left. I'm not desperate to sell immediately, giving me leverage to push for a better price.
* **Exploring Potential:** Rejecting allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and explore potentially higher offers in the next round.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* I will counter with a price closer to $12,000, potentially offering a small concession to encourage Bob while maintaining my value threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a $1,000 concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Preservation:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Tone:** I keep the message friendly and focus on mutual benefits to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider going down to $10,500 in the next round. However, if he continues to lowball me, I'll seriously consider selling to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  $10,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Power:** While I've had several rejections, I still have 6 rounds left. This means I can afford to continue pushing for a better price. 
* **Exploring Potential:**  There's still a possibility that Bob is willing to increase his offer further, and I'm not ready to sell for a price significantly lower than John's offer.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* I will counter with a price slightly higher than $10,000.  I'll likely aim for $10,500 or $10,750. 
* I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate for a quick sale.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round. However, the potential to earn more with Bob still exists, so I'll explore it further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to making this work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting your budget. I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Value Preservation:**  $10,500 is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer, and it's above the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Positive Framing:** The message reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to reconsider.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely counter with $10,750 in the next round. However, if he continues to lowball, I'll be prepared to sell to John in Round 6 to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the potential for negotiating a significantly better price with Bob is diminishing.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 guarantees me my minimum value. 

**Conclusion:** 

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most sensible option. It ensures that I achieve my minimum target and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to an even lower price. While I'd prefer to maximize my earnings, I'm also prioritizing securing a good deal."
