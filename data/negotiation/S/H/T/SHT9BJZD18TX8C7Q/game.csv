"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more. How about $10,750? This still offers you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to negotiate further. How about $10,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10200.0,Bob,4,
