"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110? I'm really interested in the product but that's my top price.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $130? I'm trying to find a fair price.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
