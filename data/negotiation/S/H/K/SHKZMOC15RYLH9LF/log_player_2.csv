# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:

Let's negotiate with Alice to see if we can get a better price. $130 is too high."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, appreciate you letting me know your thoughts.  $60 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.

While $100 is better, it's still more than I want to spend. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $75 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way, we both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and I'm not willing to pay more than $80.  It's time to go with my backup plan and buy from John."
