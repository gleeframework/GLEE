"Hey Bob, appreciate you letting me know your thoughts.  $60 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $75 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way, we both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
