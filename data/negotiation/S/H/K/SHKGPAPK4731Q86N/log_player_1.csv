**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is consistently increasing his offer, indicating serious interest. While a higher price might be achievable, the difference is getting smaller, and there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting $10,600 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
