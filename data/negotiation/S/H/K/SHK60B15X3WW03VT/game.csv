"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you placed on it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to try and make this work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering we're both trying to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $10,750 is still a little too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal. I believe it's a good price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this and close the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
