Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200.

At this point, Alice is unwilling to go below $8,200. Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $200."
