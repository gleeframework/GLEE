Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to scare him off.  I'm confident in the product's quality, and I'm aiming to make a good profit. I'll be ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $120 seems a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100? That's still a fair price considering the product's quality."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
