"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $800000 is a fair market value, this product has unique qualities that justify a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $875000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
