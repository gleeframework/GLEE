"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. How about we settle on $1,325,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000, but I'll throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value to you. This way, you'll get even more out of the deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
