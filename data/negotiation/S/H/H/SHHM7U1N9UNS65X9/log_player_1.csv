{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $120 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget.  How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
