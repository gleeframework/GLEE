"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm really interested in this product, but $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're serious about selling this, I think we can make it work at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $115. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we compromise at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
