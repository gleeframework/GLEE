Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation and a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is a Guarantee:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit. However, I'm not desperate and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Step:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm looking for something closer to $11,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I am not desperate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer. 
* **Time is a Factor:** The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that I'll have to settle for a lower price or lose Bob as a buyer.

**Next Step:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $10,000.  This ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
