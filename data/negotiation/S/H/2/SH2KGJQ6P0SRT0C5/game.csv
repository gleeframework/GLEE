"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I can't afford to pay $2,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,200,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering its potential.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,850,000 is beyond my current financial capacity. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending on this product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
