"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $150 is too high.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear negotiation range and incentivizes Alice to come down from her initial price.  While $110 is still a bit higher than Bob's maximum price, it's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Bob is determined to get the product for as close to his $120 limit as possible.  Rejecting and continuing the negotiation allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $110 to $115. This shows he is willing to compromise, while still keeping the price below his maximum. This middle ground approach is likely to encourage Alice to counter with a more acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $135, Bob is still holding out for a better deal. He's only $15 away from his maximum price and there are still rounds left.  He wants to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price, but he still wants to see if Alice will meet him halfway. By offering $125, he is showing a willingness to compromise, while still leaving room for Alice to make a counteroffer. This strategy aims to secure a deal within the next few rounds while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered the price again, $130 is still above Bob's target. He's only $10 away from his maximum price and has a few rounds left.  It's worth taking the risk to continue negotiating and try to close the deal at a lower price. There's still a chance Alice might come down further, or Bob can make a counteroffer that's closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now very close to his maximum price. This offer shows a willingness to compromise and is only $2 above his target. It's a strategic move to push Alice toward a final agreement, while still maintaining a bit of leverage. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can either accept her next counteroffer or consider buying from John, as time is running out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but it's time for Bob to accept the offer.  Alice has come down significantly, and Bob is only $9 over his target price. With only one round remaining, there's a high risk of not reaching an agreement.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product, even if it's slightly above his ideal price."
