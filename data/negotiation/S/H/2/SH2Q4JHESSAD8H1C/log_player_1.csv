Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to him for $110.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept, which is $110. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a price of $108, which is higher than his offer but still lower than my minimum price.
