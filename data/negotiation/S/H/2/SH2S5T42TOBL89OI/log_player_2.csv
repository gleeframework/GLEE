"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $135. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $135 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale. If not, you can always buy from John for $150."
