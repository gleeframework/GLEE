"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1750000. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1600000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1680000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1680000.0,Alice,5,
