"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  While it's unlikely Bob will accept this price immediately, it establishes a strong starting point.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to entice Bob and make him consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message signals I'm open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay more than his initial value of $800,000, his offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I have multiple rounds to work with, and I'm not desperate to sell immediately.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation.  He's shown interest, and I can use this to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While it's closer to what I'm looking for,  I'm still unable to go that low.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  My message emphasizes a willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us. This fosters a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly better price. There's a risk that we'll reach the end of the negotiation without a deal.
* **Secure Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and provides a good profit, making it the most sensible choice at this point."
