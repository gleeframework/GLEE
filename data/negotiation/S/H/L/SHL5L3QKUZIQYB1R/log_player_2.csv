"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have plenty of rounds to work with and can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating. It's also still within your budget, leaving room for potential compromise. This approach aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down closer to your preferred price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget and you have time to negotiate further. It's wise to continue the process and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are still trying to get a good deal.  It's a reasonable increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise, but it's still within your budget.  This should push Alice closer to your target price while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
