"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
