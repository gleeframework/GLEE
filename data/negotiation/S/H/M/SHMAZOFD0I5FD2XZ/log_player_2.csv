"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Significantly Below Valuation:** While $60 is much lower than Alice's valuation, it's important to gauge her willingness to come down significantly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind you have John's offer of $80 as a backup, so there's no pressure to accept a price you're not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down in price, $100 is still above your maximum budget of $80 and your initial offer of $60.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **Backup Option:**  Remember, you can always buy the product from John for $80 if negotiations with Alice don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** You're now offering your maximum price. This makes it clear to Alice what you're willing to spend.
* **Fair Negotiation:**  You've moved significantly from your initial offer, and Alice has also adjusted hers. $80 represents a compromise.
* **Alternative Ready:**  You're prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $80. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which is still a great deal. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's latest offer is still significantly above your maximum budget of $80.
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  Alice has shown resistance to going below $100, and your offer of $80 was already a compromise.
* **Reliable Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, your target price. There's no point in potentially overpaying."
