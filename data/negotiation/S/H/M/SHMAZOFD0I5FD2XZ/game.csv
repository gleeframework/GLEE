"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I think that's a fair offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $80. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110, which is still a great deal. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
