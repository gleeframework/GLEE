# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.
