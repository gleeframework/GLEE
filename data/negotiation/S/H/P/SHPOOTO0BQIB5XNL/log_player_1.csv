Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know if you're interested and what you think is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I signal flexibility and potentially make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer.
* **No Firm Deadline:**  I don't mention any time pressure, which allows Bob to consider the offer without feeling rushed. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by starting high and hoping to get a price closer to my desired value, while also leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a sale even if Bob rejects the offer."
