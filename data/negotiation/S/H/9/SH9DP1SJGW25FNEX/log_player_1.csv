Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for potential profit while still being appealing to Bob. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and highlights the value of the product to me. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Start high:** By starting at $14,000, I maximize my potential profit. 
* **Be flexible:** The message indicates openness to negotiation, which can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Use John as leverage:** The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 provides a clear deadline and a ""walk away"" point if the negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away.
* **Counteroffer to incentivize:** I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also keeping the pressure on Bob. 
* **John as a backup:**  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net and a limit to how far I'm willing to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would allow for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price.  
* **Fairness appeal:** Highlighting a ""fair deal"" for both parties can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:** The message still conveys that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the gap:** The counteroffer moves the negotiations closer to a potential agreement.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on what Bob gains by accepting the offer, rather than what he loses. 
* **Maintaining pressure:**  The possibility of selling to John for $15,000 serves as a reminder that time is not on Bob's side."
