"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Bob a clear incentive to negotiate while also ensuring I'm not leaving too much money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows willingness to negotiate, but still above Bob's offer. This should encourage him to come up a bit more while remaining within my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum, but the negotiation is getting increasingly tough. It's unlikely he'll budge further, and I'm risking losing time with more rounds.  John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'll sell to him to avoid potential delays and uncertainties."
