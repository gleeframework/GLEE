Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $1,400,000 is a reasonable compromise, allowing me to earn a substantial profit while still potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he's interested.
* **John as a safety net:**  The knowledge that I have a backup offer from John at $1,500,000 gives me leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Leverage with John's offer:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  I'm showing flexibility while still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Highlighting the ""good deal"":** The message emphasizes the benefit for both parties, potentially making Bob more likely to accept.
* **Maintaining John as leverage:** I'm still keeping the possibility of selling to John in mind, giving me confidence to hold firm if needed."
