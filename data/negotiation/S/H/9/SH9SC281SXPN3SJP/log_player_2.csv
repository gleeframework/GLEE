It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can save more money by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000 and John is selling the product for that price.  Accepting the offer saves you the hassle of further negotiation and you get the product for a price within your budget."
