"I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm afraid $780,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $820,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. However, $820,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
