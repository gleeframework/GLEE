"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to complete this transaction. I hope you'll consider it.",10000.0,Bob,4,

Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,6,
