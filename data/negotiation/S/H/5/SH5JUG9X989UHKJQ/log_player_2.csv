"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to offer $10,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to complete this transaction. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's worth trying to push for a lower price. If Bob can't get it down to his desired $8,000, he still has the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me, and to ensure we can both benefit from this transaction, I'm offering $10,500.  This price reflects the value gap between us and is a final attempt at compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make one more attempt at a compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I may need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of Alice dropping to Bob's target price are slim.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for his desired price of $8,000, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at his preferred price."
