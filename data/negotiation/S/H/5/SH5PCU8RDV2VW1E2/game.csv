"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $15000. Let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $15000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's unique features.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more in line with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $18000 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $16000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let me know if you're able to accept this.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $17500. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17500 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer you $16500 as my final price.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look at other options. ",16500.0,Bob,6,
