"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than your target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $107. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still hesitant at $107.  How about $102?  That's only a couple of dollars away from my budget and a fair deal for both of us.",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $102 is getting close to your budget, but I'm still willing to make a bit more room for negotiation. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $104. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",104.0,Alice,7,
