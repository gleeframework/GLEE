{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking $115 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but below your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is firm at $105.  Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to drop that low.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'll sell to him instead."
