This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than the minimum I'd accept, but it leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profits while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making an offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for anything below my minimum threshold."

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired threshold.
