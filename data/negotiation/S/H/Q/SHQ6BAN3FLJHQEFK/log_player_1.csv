Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm open to negotiating and don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly lower than my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value and is more profitable than selling to John.  I'll accept the offer and secure the sale."
