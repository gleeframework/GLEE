Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's valuation is significantly lower than yours and John's. By starting high, you can gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $10,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation, as you're not desperate to sell to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive or easily turned off by high initial offers, you might adjust your strategy slightly. However, without that information, starting high is a strong opening move. 
* **Negotiation Style:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum ($10,000) in mind."
