"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I want to make sure it goes to someone who will appreciate it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $8,000 valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $10,000."
