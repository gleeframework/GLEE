"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair compromise considering the value we both place on this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer you $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
