{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. This is a good price, but you can likely get a better deal.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering $100 for the product, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. 
* This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the product is worth $80 to Alice.
* There are still 9 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further if Alice rejects my counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has lowered her offer to $130 from $120, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer of $100.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice has increased her price back to $140. While this is better than her initial $120, it's still higher than my ideal price.
*  I'm willing to reject and continue negotiating, as I'm still within the acceptable price range and have time to try and reach a better deal.
* There are 5 rounds left, and I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can convince Alice to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

* Alice's offer of $140 is still too high, but it's a sign that she's willing to negotiate.
* I'm offering $120, which is a compromise between our last offers and still within my budget. 
* With only 4 rounds left, I need to start moving towards an acceptable price point. This counteroffer shows good faith and may incentivize Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $145 is closer to my ideal price, but it's still not the best deal. 
* I'm willing to risk one more round of negotiation because I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* The product is worth $150 to me, and I can always buy it from John if the negotiation with Alice fails. 
* It's worth trying to see if Alice will budge a bit more."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**
