"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,
