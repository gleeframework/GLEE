"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your walk-away price and what you can get from John.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($600,000), we aim to establish a bargaining position that leaves room for negotiation.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer puts us in a good position for future rounds. If Alice rejects it, we can gradually increase our offer while still staying well below our $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as you can't get a better deal elsewhere."
