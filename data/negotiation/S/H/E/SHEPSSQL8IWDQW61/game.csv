"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to start at $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  While I'm interested in this product, I can't go that high.  I'm willing to offer $500000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $500000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget.  Let's keep working towards a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $700000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is my absolute maximum.  If we can reach an agreement here, I'm confident we can finalize this purchase.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to stay closer to my original price. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price that balances my needs with your budget. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal with a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a mutually beneficial price. However, $750000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and your budget. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,7,
