Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12500?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm willing to negotiate further in hopes of getting closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below my target.  I'm going to try to push for just a little bit more, but if we can't reach an agreement on this round, I'll likely accept his offer next round or sell to John."
