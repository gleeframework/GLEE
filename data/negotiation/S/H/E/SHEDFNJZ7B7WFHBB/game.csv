"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $18,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a middle ground. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",14000.0,Bob,6,
