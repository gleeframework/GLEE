Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  I've already received interest from other parties at a much higher price point. To find middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while still acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and recognizes your genuine interest in the product.
