"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  I've already received interest from other parties at a much higher price point. To find middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while still acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I understand the product's value, but my budget is firm at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and recognizes your genuine interest in the product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's unique value and the positive impact it will have on your business.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise for me. I truly believe this product has great potential for my business, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
