"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and opens the door for a potential positive interaction. 
* **Room for counteroffers:** Leaving some space for negotiation makes it more likely Bob will counteroffer rather than simply reject my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm really interested, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for me to negotiate upwards. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I can potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations.
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $80 would be guaranteed, but holding out offers the chance for a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $100 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair deal.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth by suggesting that $110 is still a fair price, despite his budget constraints.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains friendly, showing that I'm open to reaching an agreement."
