"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $180 is above Bob's maximum price point of $150. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $180 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $150?  That's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $165? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $165 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum of $150.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $150, he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $157.50.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 157.50} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $157.50 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. How about I sell it to you for $160? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $150.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of not reaching a deal and having to pay a higher price from another seller is too high.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his target price."
