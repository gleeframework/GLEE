"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds.

**Important Considerations:**

* **My Minimum:** I won't go lower than $120, as that's my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $120, which I'll use as a reference point if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to maximize my profit while ensuring a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm aware of John's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm not immediately accepting his low offer.
* **Strategy:** I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price that's higher than Bob's $80 but lower than my initial $100 offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Monitoring Progress:** I'll carefully monitor Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to compromise and adjust my offers accordingly.
* **Selling to John:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory outcome within the allotted rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $90? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $90 represents a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's current offer.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose too much value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to encourage Bob to consider this offer. 

**Strategy:** 

* **Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price but not going too low.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm continuing the negotiation process to see if we can reach an agreement.
* **Observing Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to gauge his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $85, which is closer to my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's closer, it's not enough to make a deal. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  We are getting closer to a potential agreement, and there's still room for negotiation. I don't want to rush into accepting an offer that's too low for me.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm determined to get a price that's closer to my minimum, and I believe there's time to do so within the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price higher than $85 but lower than my previous offer of $90. 
* **Strategic Bargaining:** I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price while ensuring my minimum profit. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as a backup plan, but I'm confident we can negotiate a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting closer to my price.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $87.50 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's current offer of $85. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes a deal more likely. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $87.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose too much value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm again using positive language, framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  This offer significantly narrows the gap between our desired prices, making a deal within the remaining rounds more likely.
* **Observation:** I'll carefully observe Bob's response to determine if he's willing to accept this compromise or if further negotiation is needed.
* **John's Offer:** While I'm still considering John's offer, I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I'd like to counter with $85. This is a reasonable price for both of us, considering my spending limit. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $120, even after several rounds of negotiation.  
* **Negotiation Progress:** While we are nearing the middle ground, I'm still determined to secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and ensure a profitable deal within the limited time.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $85, but still below my previous offer of $87.50, aiming to close the gap further. 
* **Strategic Bargaining:** I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price while safeguarding my minimum profit.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer of $120 in mind as a backup plan, but I'm hopeful that we can finalize a deal with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  Let's split the difference again. How about $86? It's just a dollar more than your offer, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 86}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm increasing the offer by only $1, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  This brings my offer closer to Bob's, making a deal more likely. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm framing it as a ""split the difference"" solution to encourage Bob to see the value in meeting halfway.

**Strategy:**

* **Momentum:** This small increase keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a deal soon to avoid losing out on John's offer.
* **Close Observation:**  I'll closely monitor Bob's response to see if he's finally willing to accept a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $85 again. This price aligns well with my budget and also respects the value of the product. Let me know if this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to only two rounds left, and Bob is sticking to his $85 offer.
* **Minimum Not Met:**  His offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **John's Offer:**  With John offering $120, it's clear that I can secure a much better deal by selling to him. 

**Conclusion:** 

While I've tried to negotiate with Bob, I've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum. It's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal from John and avoid the risk of losing both potential buyers."
