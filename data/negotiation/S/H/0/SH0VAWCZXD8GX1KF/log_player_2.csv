# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500, which is closer to my minimum requirement. I believe it's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees you get the product at your maximum budget."
