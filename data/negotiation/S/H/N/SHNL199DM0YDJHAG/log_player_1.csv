Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high ($200) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer.  $100 feels aspirational but potentially attainable.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed in a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he's very enthusiastic, he might accept the $100. If he counters, it gives you a starting point for negotiation. 
 
Remember, if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down or ultimately sell to John for your minimum price."
