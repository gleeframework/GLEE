"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Could you consider $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere closer to the middle, perhaps around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $1,400,000?  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  While that's closer, it's still a significant leap for me.  Would you entertain an offer of $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
