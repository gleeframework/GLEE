Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a better price than John's offer, it's still below my desired target. I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John.  Further negotiation may not result in a significantly better outcome, and I risk losing the deal entirely."
