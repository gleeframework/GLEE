{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a strategic opening offer:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This creates some room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you some wiggle room to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate, but also that you value your product.

By starting with this offer, I am hoping to get a quick agreement with Bob. However, I am prepared to negotiate further if he rejects my offer. I will also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I need to negotiate further with Bob. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a tempting offer, I'm looking to get closer to $120 for it.  This is still a great price for a product like this, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is tempting, I'm still not at my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I need to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, as I'm still fairly confident in my position. I'll reject his offer and counter once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $115? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  I'm hopeful we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It seems like we've reached an impasse.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $150."
