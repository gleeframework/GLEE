"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to lower it in the following rounds, but I want to start high to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a good deal. It's above my minimum price of $1,200,000 and it's a good compromise. It's unlikely that I'll be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
