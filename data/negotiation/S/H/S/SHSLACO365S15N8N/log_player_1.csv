Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close the deal.
