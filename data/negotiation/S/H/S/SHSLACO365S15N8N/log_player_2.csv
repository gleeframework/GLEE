# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum price. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $1,075,000 is still slightly above my limit. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,060,000 is still not quite meeting my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $1,065,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to both be happy with the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,065,000, which is only $65,000 above my maximum price. While I'd ideally prefer a lower price,  it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product, and it's a better price than buying from John."
