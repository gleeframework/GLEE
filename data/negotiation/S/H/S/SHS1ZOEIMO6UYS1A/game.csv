"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe we could reach a fair agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll gain from the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
