Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high and leave room for compromise while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While his offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows willingness to compromise while also trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial price,  Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
