Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell my product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:** Starting with a strong initial offer above Bob's perceived value gives me room to negotiate. It allows me to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price closer to my minimum while still exceeding his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $15,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know he values the product at $10,000. There's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. This counteroffer acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while still pushing for a price significantly higher than his initial offer and his perceived value. It keeps the negotiation alive while leaving me room to potentially go lower if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll make one last attempt to negotiate. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm comfortable offering $16,500 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's latest offer is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than his initial offer and above my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for a bit more in another round, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
