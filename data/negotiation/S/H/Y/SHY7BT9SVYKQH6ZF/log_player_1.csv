Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing the potential value he'll get. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $950,000, I can potentially accept a counteroffer that's still profitable for me.
* **The backup plan:** I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage and prevents me from accepting offers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price.  There's room for counteroffers and further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a higher price, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to persuade Bob.
* **Positive and persuasive tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more likely to accept the offer.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, which gives me some wiggle room in case Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $870,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a decent profit as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $870,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is getting tiresome:**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it seems like we're not getting any closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is more than I would make by accepting Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal with John."
