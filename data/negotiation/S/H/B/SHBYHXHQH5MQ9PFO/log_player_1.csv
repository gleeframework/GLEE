Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you are subtly reminding Bob of its worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable. 
* **Alternative:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob could lose out to other buyers if he doesn't act, potentially motivating him to accept. 

While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit with Bob."
