"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we compromise at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $7,750? It's still a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,750 is still too low.  How about we split the difference again and go with $8,250? This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's find a common ground and finalize this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $7,900? It's getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?",7900.0,Bob,6,
