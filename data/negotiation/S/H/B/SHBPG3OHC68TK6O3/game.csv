"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I need to at least get $9,000 for this. Let's find a middle ground, I'm sure we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,750? I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to drop my price a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,900 for this.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short on my budget. How about we meet at $8,700? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my limits.",8700.0,Bob,6,
