"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
