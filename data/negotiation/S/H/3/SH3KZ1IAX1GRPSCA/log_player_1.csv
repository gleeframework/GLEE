"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay at least $120, since that's what it's worth to him.  If he rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but I want to see if I can get the higher price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I have plenty of rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price, considering the product is worth $120 to him. If he rejects this offer, I'll be more willing to consider selling to John, as the negotiation is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob won't go any higher, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $120."
