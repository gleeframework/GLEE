"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $175. Would you be interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:** I use positive language (""amazing product"") to try and build rapport and pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, so I've left room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob is interested, and I can likely get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $150, it's not the optimal outcome. I might be able to get closer to my ideal price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows I'm willing to compromise and signals a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob that the product is valuable and that this price is still fair. 
* **Open ended question:** I use an open-ended question to encourage further negotiation and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $140 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Close to a deal:** While $140 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more by continuing to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is still not ideal:**  While John is willing to pay my minimum, I prefer to try and get closer to my ideal price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $145. This is a fair price, given the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:** I'm offering a price just above Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By saying ""let's try to find a solution"", I am implying that this might be my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $130 is below my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:**  We've been going back and forth, and it's unlikely Bob will go much higher.
* **John offers a guaranteed good price:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, given the limited rounds and Bob's unwillingness to budge, selling to John is the most pragmatic decision."
