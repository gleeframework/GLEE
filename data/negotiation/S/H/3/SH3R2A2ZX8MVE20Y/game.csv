"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000.  This price reflects both the value of the product to you and my need to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to move forward with the deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
