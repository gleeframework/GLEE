"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 from John, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum value ($800,000). Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  leaving room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to sell at her minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. While it's closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still not ideal. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so it's better to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. $900,000 is a reasonable compromise that is still below Alice's current offer and closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to Bob's maximum price.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are minimal. It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, as this ensures the deal is closed and avoids further rounds of negotiation that may not result in a significantly better price."
