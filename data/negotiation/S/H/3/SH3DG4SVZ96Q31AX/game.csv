"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  How about $16000? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to buy the product without going over my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $17500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $16250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I would be happy to finalize the purchase.",16250.0,Bob,6,
