Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially getting me even closer to $150. 
* **High Enough Above Bob's Value:** While $100 is Bob's perceived value, there's a chance he might pay a bit more if he finds the product desirable enough. $149 is a significant markup, but not entirely unreasonable depending on the product's nature.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer.  However, since John provides a guaranteed $150, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first."
