"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This gives you a good discount, and it's a fair price for me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000.  That's a significant price difference for me and shows I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
