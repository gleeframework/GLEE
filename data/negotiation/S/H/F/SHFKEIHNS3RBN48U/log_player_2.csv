"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice likely won't accept this price immediately, it's a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's value of $10,000. This gives Alice room to counteroffer while still leaving potential for Bob to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous offer, but still below John's price. There is still room for negotiation. Bob can attempt to bridge the gap with a new counteroffer, potentially finding a price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is higher than his previous one, showing willingness to compromise, but it's still lower than Alice's offer. This gives Alice another chance to counter while still keeping the potential for a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $15,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price, and there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without the risk of losing it."
