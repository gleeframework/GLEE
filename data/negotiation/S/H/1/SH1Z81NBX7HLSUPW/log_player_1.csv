"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great price for a product worth significantly more to you. Let's start our negotiation here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. How about we start at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**  
* **Selling to John at $1,000,000 is still a good option, but I believe I can do better with Bob.** 
* **I have 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still a ways off. How about $925,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.**
* **While selling to John at $1,000,000 is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.**
* **I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, so there's still time to reach a more favorable agreement.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $925,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a significant deal for you, and I believe it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
