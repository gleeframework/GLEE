,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still a ways off. How about $925,000? That's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $925,000 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a significant deal for you, and I believe it's fair to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
