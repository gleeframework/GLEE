You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject the offer.  While the product is worth more to Bob than Alice, he can likely get a better price.  There's a clear gap in their valuation, and Bob has room to negotiate."

Bob should reject the offer again. He's still trying to get the product for as low as possible, and he knows that Alice is likely willing to come down a bit more.  He should try to push for a lower price in the next round."
