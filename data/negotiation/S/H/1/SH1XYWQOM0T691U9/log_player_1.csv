Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it provides significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly lower than Bob's value allows room for negotiation if needed, while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John ($10,000), so you can afford to be a bit bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
