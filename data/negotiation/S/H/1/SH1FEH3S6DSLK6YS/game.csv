"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially asking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price for this exceptional product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and land at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come up a bit to $1,000,000.  This is a fair offer and should work for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
