Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but not a reason to immediately reject.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn closer to your minimum. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a fair offer, it's a bit lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your enthusiasm.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and pay $85 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob and it seems like we're not getting closer to a price I'm happy with. John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so I'll take that option."
