{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,250?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your budget considerations. In light of this, I am proposing a final offer of $10000 for our premium product. This still maintains a fair valuation of the product while providing some flexibility for your purchasing decision. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 matches Bob's maximum budget and is the same price as what John is offering.  It's a good deal and there's no reason to risk a further negotiation, which might lead to Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at the same price."
