"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it brings.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,400,000. This price is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's continue our conversation from this point.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer to a deal. I've already lowered my price significantly, and your offer is still well below what I need to accept. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. If you're genuinely interested in this deal, we need to find a middle ground. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my previous counteroffer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm not sure how much lower I can go. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us both to benefit from the deal. I need to be closer to this price to make it worth my while. If you're serious about acquiring the product, we need to find common ground. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
