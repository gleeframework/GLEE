Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a fair price considering the unique value proposition it offers."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value, but I have budget constraints to consider. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's not worth the risk of Bob's offers going lower or the negotiation dragging on for several more rounds. Taking the guaranteed $800,000 now is the safest and most profitable decision."
