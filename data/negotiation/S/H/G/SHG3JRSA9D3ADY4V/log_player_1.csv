Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial offer gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while still aiming for a substantial profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the product's value and my willingness to negotiate a deal, without seeming desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. I'm better off rejecting his offer and proposing a counteroffer closer to my target price.  I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations because I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($700,000) and my previous asking price ($950,000). However, it's intentionally skewed slightly in my favor. 
* **Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price. 
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:** The language (""meet in the middle"") aims for a collaborative rather than adversarial negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, his offer of $750,000 is still below my guaranteed sale to John at $800,000. Further negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate or a final offer still below my backup option. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sure profit with John."
