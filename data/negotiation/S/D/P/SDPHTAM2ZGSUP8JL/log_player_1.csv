Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our $1,000,000 minimum, his offer increases are getting smaller. At this point, it's unlikely we'll get much further than his $975,000 offer, especially with only four rounds left.  

John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000 which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
