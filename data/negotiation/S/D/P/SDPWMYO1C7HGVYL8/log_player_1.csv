Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Being friendly and open can encourage Bob to engage and potentially increase the chances of a deal.
* **Flexibility:** Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially secure a higher price without immediately risking a rejection. 

I'm willing to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it would be selling myself short.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the new price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Openness:** Ending with a question encourages further negotiation and potentially leads to a deal. 

I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John for $150 if this offer is rejected, but I believe a compromise is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $125, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $150.  I'm confident that with one more counteroffer, I can reach a price that's more advantageous for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is getting closer, but it's still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product!"", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find a solution. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I reiterate that the price is ""fair"" to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making it less likely he'll feel pressured.
* **Positive language:** I use positive language (""love the product"") to build a positive association with the product and encourage a yes.

While I'm willing to walk away and sell to John, I'm confident that this final counteroffer will secure a deal with Bob at a price that's closer to my desired minimum."
