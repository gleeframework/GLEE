"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,3,
