"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to let it go for $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we discuss $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value you place on the product, I can't go as low as $1,500,000. Let's settle this right now. How about $1,550,000? This offer stands firm.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
