Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $10,000. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so this is a high starting point. I'm aiming for a quick sale and don't want to risk Bob walking away and me having to settle with John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's offer of $8,000 and my initial asking price of $10,000. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired $10,000,  $8,500 is a good compromise, especially considering the risk of losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000. This deal secures a price that's within my acceptable range and avoids further negotiation."
