"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find the best possible deal. Offering $13,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This should start a conversation and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering his maximum willingness to pay is $15,000.  It's also a better price than what John is offering.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to John's price and ensures a deal without further negotiation."
