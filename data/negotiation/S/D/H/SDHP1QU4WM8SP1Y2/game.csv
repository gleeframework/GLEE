"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product looks great, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000, but that's really my limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $9,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the closest I can get to my target without giving it away.",10500.0,Alice,5,
