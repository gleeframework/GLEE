It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You're only $25,000 away from your desired price, and you might be able to get her to budge a bit more."

Alice is coming down, but not fast enough. You're getting close to your goal, but at this point, it's probably quicker and easier to just buy from John. You'll save yourself the hassle of more negotiation and be sure of a price you're comfortable with."
