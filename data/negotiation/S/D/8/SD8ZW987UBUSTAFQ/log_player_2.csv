"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $10,000 to you. I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive rate. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's value:** Alice values the product at $8,000, so even offering it at $9,500 is a good deal for her. 
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **John's price:**  John is willing to sell for $10,000.

Since Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no reason for him to accept Alice's offer of $9,500. He can save $500 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
