"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that is significantly below its market value. While I value it at $1,500,000, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price that aligns with your needs. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have other interested parties who are ready to purchase at the full market price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
