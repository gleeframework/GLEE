"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to me. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your preferred price point. Since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, there's no immediate pressure to accept. It's still beneficial to continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your initial counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,025,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is only $25,000 lower than John's price. At this point, the potential for further negotiation with Alice is minimal, and the risk of going through more rounds without a satisfactory outcome is high. It's more efficient to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, securing the product at a known and reasonable price."
