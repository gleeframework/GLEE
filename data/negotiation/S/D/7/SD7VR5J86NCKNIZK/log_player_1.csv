Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I am very interested in the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, as I can purchase the same product elsewhere for that price.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob.
