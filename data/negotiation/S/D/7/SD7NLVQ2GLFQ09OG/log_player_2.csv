"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's always worth negotiating, especially when you have a fallback option like John. You can potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11500 to see if we can reach an agreement.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good price, considering the product's value to you is only $10,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at $10,000 isn't worth it. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a fair price."
