Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies that the price is justified, even if she doesn't explicitly state why it's worth more to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational, ""What do you think?"", suggesting Alice is open to discussing the price and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable figure.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still having a good chance of securing a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
