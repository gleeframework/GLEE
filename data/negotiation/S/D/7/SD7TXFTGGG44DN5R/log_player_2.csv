"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings. Offering $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still above Alice's value of $12,000, but significantly lower than the initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save a decent amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob is still trying to get the best deal. Rejecting this offer gives him the opportunity to counter with a price closer to his desired range. There's still a chance Alice might come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of trying to get the best possible price. He's increasing his offer slightly, but still remaining below Alice's offer. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to compromise, but also that he won't simply accept the first offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice and may push her towards accepting a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same as what John is offering.  At this point, there is no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice.  The time and effort involved in further negotiation are unlikely to yield a lower price, and Bob has already stated that his maximum budget is $15,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to buy from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick purchase."
