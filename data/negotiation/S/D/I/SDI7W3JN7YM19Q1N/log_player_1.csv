Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
