"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. You want to see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand where you're coming from, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is really valuable and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of benefit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's within Bob's budget of $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and he'll be left with only John as an option.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
