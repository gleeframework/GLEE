"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to meet your high standards. This product holds significant value to me, but I understand its true worth lies in how it can benefit you. Considering its exceptional quality and the impact it could have on your endeavors, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate, tailored to maximize your satisfaction and ROI. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still above your $15,000 limit. By rejecting her offer, you can leverage John's offer and potentially negotiate a better price. Alice might also come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
