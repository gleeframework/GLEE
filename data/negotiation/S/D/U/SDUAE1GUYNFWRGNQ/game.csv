,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $82, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $82 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $78, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $80, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $80, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",80.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $80 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $77, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at $77, I'll consider it a great deal.",77.0,Bob,8,
