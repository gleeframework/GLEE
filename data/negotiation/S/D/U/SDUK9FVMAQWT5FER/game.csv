"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15000 is my absolute minimum,  I'm willing to come down slightly to $17500. This reflects the exceptional value and quality of this product.  Let's find a compromise we can both agree on.",17500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit above my budget with $17500. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Is there any flexibility in the price?,14000.0,Bob,4,
