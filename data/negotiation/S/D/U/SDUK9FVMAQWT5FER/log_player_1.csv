Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Bob is not budging much on his price, and at this point, I'm starting to think I won't get much more. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John."
