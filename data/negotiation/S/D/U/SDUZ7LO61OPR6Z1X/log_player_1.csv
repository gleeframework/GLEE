"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $115. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $110 is a bit lower than my initial offer, it's still a good deal for me and likely the best I can get in this scenario. I'm not going to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate, as I'm happy with the price and Bob is likely to be happy as well."
