Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a significant profit margin while still being an attractive price for Bob, who values it at $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob stands to gain $100,000 in value ($1,500,000 - $1,400,000) if he accepts. This is a strong incentive for him.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John if Bob rejects the offer. This allows me to confidently aim for a higher price with Bob. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having a safety net in place."
