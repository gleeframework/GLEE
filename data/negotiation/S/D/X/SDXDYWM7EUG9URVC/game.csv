"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway,  at $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise and get us both closer to what we want.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,075,000 is closer to your budget, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the product's true worth.  Would you consider $1,090,000? I believe this is a fair offer that acknowledges both our positions.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
