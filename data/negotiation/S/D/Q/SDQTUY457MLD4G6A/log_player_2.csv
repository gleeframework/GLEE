"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can continue to negotiate,  $11,500 is a good price considering his maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise."
