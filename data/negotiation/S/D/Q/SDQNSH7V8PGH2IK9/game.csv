"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the movement, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000 and call it a deal?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle. I can do $825,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a discount from my initial price. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm sensing we're close.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
