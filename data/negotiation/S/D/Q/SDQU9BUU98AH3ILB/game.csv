"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,
