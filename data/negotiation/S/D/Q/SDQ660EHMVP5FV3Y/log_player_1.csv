Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept outright if he perceives the value to be higher.
* **Limited Time:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** My success depends on how much Bob values the product. If he sees it as a good deal at $150, I'll earn a profit.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to adjust my price and still potentially sell above my minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I can afford to be a bit bolder with Bob."
