"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your optimism, $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a price that's mutually beneficial.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $1,000,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  Let's try to find a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,800,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 remains above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value I see and my budget constraints. Let's find common ground to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly away from my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more substantial movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm applying some pressure here by calling this my ""final offer.""  This might incentivize Bob to make a more substantial jump in his next offer if he's truly interested. I'm still aiming for a price that's comfortably above my minimum while recognizing the need to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a mutually beneficial price in this round to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer is above my minimum acceptable price, and Bob is clearly showing a willingness to negotiate. Accepting now ensures I get a good deal without risking further negotiation pushing the price back down or losing the deal altogether."
