Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to $1,000,000 is more reflective of that. This is a smaller step than your initial offer, reflecting my willingness to find a compromise.
