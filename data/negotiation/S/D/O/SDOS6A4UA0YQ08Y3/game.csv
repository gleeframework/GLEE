"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant offer, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
