Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $80, which is your minimum.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  Bob is likely to see this as a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still potentially increase the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if you can negotiate a higher price. You also have the option to sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet your price."
