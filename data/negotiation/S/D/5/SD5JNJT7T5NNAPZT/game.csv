"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you and the original price I was willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the value the product brings to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.",900000.0,Bob,6,
