"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $875000 to me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to propose $825000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
