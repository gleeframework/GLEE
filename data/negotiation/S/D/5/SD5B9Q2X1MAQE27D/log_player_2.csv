It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is showing some flexibility, but we can still push for a lower price. Rejecting again and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, aiming for a price in the middle of Alice's last offer and my previous one. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and we've already significantly reduced the price.  Accepting the offer will save a good amount compared to John's price, and further negotiation may not lead to a much lower price."
