"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your asking price and the product's value to me. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and a price that still offers you a substantial benefit. Let's close this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
