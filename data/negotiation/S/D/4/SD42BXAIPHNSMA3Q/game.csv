"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its value.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $650,000 is quite a drop from my initial offer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to negotiate. Would you consider $900,000?  This reflects the true value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still finding it difficult to meet that price point.  Could you consider $725,000? It's a significant increase from my last offer and would allow me to make this purchase.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this seems to be a sticking point for us.  $825,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to make my final offer at $760,000.  This represents a fair compromise and demonstrates my serious intent to purchase this product.",760000.0,Bob,6,
