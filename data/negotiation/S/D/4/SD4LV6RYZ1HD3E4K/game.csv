"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your initial offer was a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to consider a final price of $1,060,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,060,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,090,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
