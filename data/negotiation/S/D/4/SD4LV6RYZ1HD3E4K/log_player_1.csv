Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to consider a final price of $1,060,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.
