{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's split the difference.  I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is just slightly below my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a good deal considering his budget constraints and the potential for further negotiations to be fruitless."
