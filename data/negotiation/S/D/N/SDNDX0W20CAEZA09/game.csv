"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the starting price a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you. I'm willing to be flexible, so I propose a revised price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment. To meet you halfway, how about we settle on $1,225,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
