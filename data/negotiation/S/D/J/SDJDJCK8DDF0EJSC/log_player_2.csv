"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible deal.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive in his counteroffer. He knows Alice's minimum price is $12,000 and is aiming for a price in the middle of the range.  He has 9 rounds left and is likely to get a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price and wants to keep negotiating. While $13,700 is a better deal than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. By rejecting this offer, he can continue to negotiate and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving and may convince Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now matched Bob's counteroffer.  This is a good deal for Bob as it's significantly cheaper than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
