"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the benefits you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget, though. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider letting it go for $950,000.  This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $775,000.  My final offer is $875,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's more than fair.",875000.0,Alice,5,
