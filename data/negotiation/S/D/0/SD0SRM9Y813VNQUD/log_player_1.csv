Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for an exclusive price of $150. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle the price down. 
* **Justification:** By framing the price as ""exclusive"" and a ""fantastic deal,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** I'm aware John will buy for $100, but I don't want to settle for that immediately. This offer leaves me a $50 buffer to potentially negotiate with Bob while still exceeding my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay, I started high for a reason. There's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better price from Bob. I'll aim for a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price.
* **Middle Ground:** $125 is a fair compromise, still leaving me with a $25 profit over my minimum and Bob with a perceived discount.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm avoiding drastic price drops to maintain the product's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $110, if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $110 is a reasonable compromise. It provides me with a $10 profit over my minimum selling price to John. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might only yield a few more dollars, if any. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids potentially losing out on both Bob and John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely in the next round. Accepting now guarantees a sale at a price I'm happy with."
