"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him a sense of a good deal while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to accept given the possibility of going through more rounds of negotiation, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident this will be a valuable asset for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price that considers your needs and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll run out of rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
