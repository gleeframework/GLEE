Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation.  This offer is significantly higher than my minimum, but also gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price from him.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going down a little bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's counteroffer.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility but also a desire to get closer to my target."
