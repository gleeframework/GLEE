Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts. 

Here's why:

* **It's attractive to Bob:** He gets a $100,000 discount on the product's value to him. 
* **It's profitable for you:** You earn $400,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.

There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer and you'd sell to John for $1,000,000, but this offer gives you the best chance of getting a higher price."
