"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, and $8,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,250. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and seal the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer on that price point. If you're still interested, let's discuss further.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $8,800. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, let's discuss further.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm trying to be fair. However, $9,100 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,900.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without any more back and forth.  What do you say?",8900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,900. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,050, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",9050.0,Alice,9,
