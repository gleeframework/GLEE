"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a bidding war.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a good option, but I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering Bob's low offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000.  This is a compromise, but it's still within a reasonable range for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal and will move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price.  I'm starting to get concerned, however, as I'm running out of rounds. I may need to reconsider selling to John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm dropping my offer to my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept.  I'm running out of time, and if he rejects this offer, I will likely have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  I can't risk another rejection and potentially end up with nothing.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
