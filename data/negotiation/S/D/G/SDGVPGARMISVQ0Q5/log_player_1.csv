Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to something closer to my budget, say around $1,000,000?

We are still getting closer to the desired price point. It's too early to settle for $1,375,000. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher in the next round."

```

While we didn't reach $1,400,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is the most strategic decision at this point.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,380,000 is a significant profit above our $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer.
* **Time Value:**  A deal today is worth more than a potential deal tomorrow.  

Accepting now locks in a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
