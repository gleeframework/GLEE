"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?  This reflects the value it brings while still allowing for a strong return on your investment.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is still a significant discount from its true value. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings and the potential return on investment. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
