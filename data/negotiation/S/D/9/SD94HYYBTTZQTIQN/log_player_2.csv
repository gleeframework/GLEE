I'm offering Alice $8,500. This is still a good deal for her since she values the product at $12,000. It also gives me some room to negotiate in case she wants to counteroffer."

Alice is not willing to go lower than $9,250, which is still higher than my target price. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk going another round and losing the chance to buy from John for a better price."
