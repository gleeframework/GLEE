Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts with a reasonable price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer, but also allows for a potential counteroffer that could lead to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter Bob's offer to try and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
