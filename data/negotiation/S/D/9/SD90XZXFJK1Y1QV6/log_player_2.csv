"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not in the ballpark for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and you can get the product from John for $1,200,000 right now. There's no guarantee you'll get a better deal from Alice even with more rounds of negotiation."
