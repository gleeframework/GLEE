"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the transaction. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not in the ballpark for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
