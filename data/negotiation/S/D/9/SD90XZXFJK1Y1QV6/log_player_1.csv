"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is optimistic and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, creating a positive starting point for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Buffer:**  By leaving a $200,000 buffer, I have room to lower the price if necessary, but I'm not giving away too much at the start.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I'm aware of my ""Plan B"" with John, which gives me leverage in case Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also far below the initial offer I made.
* **Leverage:**  While Bob's offer shows interest, I still have leverage because I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm using my leverage to make a counter-offer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:**  While I'm dropping from my initial offer, I'm not going too low.  This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""good deal"" and focuses on a ""win-win"" scenario, which can encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Next Steps:**  By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm opening the door for further negotiation while keeping the ball in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have a strong alternative with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me significant leverage in negotiations.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to secure a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Time Constraint:** While 10 rounds might seem like a lot, time is valuable.  I'm not willing to settle for a price far below my minimum unless there's a strong indication that a better deal is impossible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,175,000 is still not in the ballpark for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given the value of the product, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm using a common negotiation tactic, proposing to split the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This often feels fair to both parties.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm dropping my price, I'm still above Bob's last offer, keeping the leverage in my favor.
* **Building towards a Deal:**  I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""reach an agreement,"" setting a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""What do you say?"" I leave the door open for Bob to accept or counter, keeping the dialogue going."
