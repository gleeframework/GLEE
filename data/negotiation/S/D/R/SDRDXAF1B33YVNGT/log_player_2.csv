"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price point. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** While $60 is a low offer, it's possible Alice is motivated to sell and might be willing to negotiate further. If not, we can always adjust our offer upwards in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $100 is still significantly higher than our target price and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to a price we're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:**  We're increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not making a huge jump.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 puts us within striking distance of our $80 walk-away point, giving us some bargaining power.
* **Justification:** By suggesting it's a ""fair compromise"", we're nudging Alice towards a deal while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet at $110, and we can call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Alice has barely moved from her previous offer of $100, suggesting she's not willing to meet our price range.
* **Over Budget:** Even with a counteroffer, it's unlikely we'll get Alice down to a price close to $80. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed price that fits our budget. There's no point in potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice for a price we're not comfortable with."
