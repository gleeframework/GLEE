Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, as it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high as to scare him off immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'd like to see if I can get more.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price and a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and possibly end up with nothing."
