Alice's offer:

Alice is coming down, but slowly. There's still room to negotiate before reaching the John alternative."

Alice's offer:

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price Bob is comfortable with, but there's still room to negotiate before going with John's offer."

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Signals urgency:** By saying ""final offer"" Bob puts a bit of pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Offers a seemingly fair compromise:** Splitting the difference can feel more agreeable than another round of back-and-forth.
* **Keeps Bob below his maximum:** It's important Bob stays below his $12,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,650. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650

```

Alice has countered with a price that is very close to Bob's last offer. Since this is her ""final offer"" and it's a reasonable price, it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result for Bob. Accepting avoids the risk of Alice backing out or the price going up."
