Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.
