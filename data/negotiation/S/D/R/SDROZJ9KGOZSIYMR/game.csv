"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to a deal that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,3,
