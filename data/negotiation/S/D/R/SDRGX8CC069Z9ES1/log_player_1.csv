{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the ""true value"" and ""opportunity"" emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer creates a good starting point for negotiation and allows for a more nuanced exchange with Bob. 

**Important Note:** I will be closely watching Bob's response and any counteroffers.  If the negotiation drags on or doesn't seem promising, I will be prepared to switch to John, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is no more than $800000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin and my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and gauge his willingness to compromise. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum price, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob could potentially lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Closer to My Desired Price:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my minimum price. This positions me for a profitable sale while showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value and Compromise:** I emphasize the product's ""true value"" and my willingness to ""find a middle ground,"" suggesting a fair and mutually beneficial agreement is possible.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  This counteroffer allows for continued dialogue and potential concessions, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Note:** I will be closely watching Bob's response and any counteroffers.  If his offers continue to be significantly lower than my desired price, I will be prepared to switch to John to secure my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and doesn't offer the profit I'm seeking.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Bob has stated this is his ""highest"" offer, indicating there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, ensuring a substantial profit. 

While continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a slightly higher price, the risk of a prolonged negotiation with a diminishing chance of a successful outcome outweighs the potential gain.  

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and move on to other opportunities."
