"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is no more than $800000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a good deal considering the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
