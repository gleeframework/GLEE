``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and leaves a healthy profit margin for me. It also shows that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob, but I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but not by a large margin. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price, but I need something closer to $11,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference? "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $8,000 and it's getting close to my initial offer of $12,000.  I'm happy to accept it."
