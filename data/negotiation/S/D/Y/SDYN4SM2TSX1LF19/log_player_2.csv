"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $75 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  
* You don't know Alice's minimum selling price, so you might be able to get it for less.
* You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to be patient and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't come down.
* $60 is still within my budget and leaves room for some potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $65, which is a good price considering she rejected my initial counteroffer.
*  It's still within my budget and a decent saving from my maximum limit of $120.
* Continuing to negotiate might get me a few dollars lower, but it's not worth risking losing the deal to John."
