"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $20,000 is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one and settle on $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above your budget. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and going back up in price is too high.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $8,000 and secure the product within your budget."
