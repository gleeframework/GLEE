Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, so he has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not giving it away. 

By starting with this offer, you open the door for negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a good price for you, and it lets me make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
