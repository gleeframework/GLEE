Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Openness to Offers:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to offers, signaling flexibility.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  If he rejects this offer, I'll use his counteroffer to inform my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to pay less than $150. Could we discuss a price closer to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum of $120. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the message open-ended, encouraging Bob to counter if he still feels the price is too high.

This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate further. If he rejects again, I'll need to consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum price, and I'm not going to get a better offer from him.  While John is also willing to pay $120, there's no incentive to sell to him instead of Bob."
