"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's a unique piece, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it for $10000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000 is a good starting point, but Bob wants to see if he can get it lower.
* **John's offer:** $12,000 is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Strategy:** It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 more rounds, so there's time to explore."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob aims for a significant price reduction to signal his seriousness about saving money.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  He frames the offer as ""fair for both of us"" to create a cooperative tone.
* **Room for Negotiation:** $8,500 leaves room for Alice to counter and still make a profit, making it more likely she'll accept or make a reasonable counteroffer."
