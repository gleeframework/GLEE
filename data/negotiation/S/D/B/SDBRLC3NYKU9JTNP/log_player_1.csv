Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm looking to get $140 for it. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's value but lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and optimistic, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm not just giving a price, I'm also emphasizing the product's worth to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider the following:
    * **Counteroffer close to my minimum:**  I might accept to avoid a lengthy negotiation.
    * **Counteroffer significantly lower:**  I'll likely make a counteroffer closer to my starting point, or potentially switch to John if the counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $130?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. I can potentially squeeze out a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer closer to my minimum, aiming to secure a price between $130 and $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm still aiming to get a bit more for the product. Would you consider $135?  It's still a good deal for you and would be fair for me."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** I'm offering $135, which is closer to my minimum of $150 but still slightly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a firm price point. 
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully sold the product at a reasonable price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to assess his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower than my minimum, I'll either make a final counteroffer closer to $150 or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you want to get a good price, and $135 is closer. I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $132?  It's still a good profit for you and a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even at $132, I'm still not meeting my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, I'm getting closer to my own price floor, making further negotiation less productive.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a guaranteed and acceptable price. It's a more efficient decision than continuing to negotiate with Bob, considering the current offer and my minimum price."
