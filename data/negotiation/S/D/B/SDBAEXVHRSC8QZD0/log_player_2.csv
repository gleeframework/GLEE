"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's value of $8,000 as possible.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $8,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but not so low as to be insulting or unreasonable. It gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Early Negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $8,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $8,800 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. This suggests there's room for further negotiation to get a price that benefits both parties.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can make another counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to his desired amount, perhaps even $8,500.
* **No Immediate Pressure:** There are still 7 rounds left, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a deal that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,800 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500. How about we split the difference at $8,650?"", ""product_price"": 8650}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway, but still tries to secure a better deal than her previous offer.
* **Strategic Price:** $8,650 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly closer to Alice's value than Bob's initial counteroffer, but still allows for some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **Maintain Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and prevents the price from becoming stagnant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet in the middle at $8,725? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,725. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,725
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $8,725 is very close to Bob's desired price of $8,500. While it's a bit higher, the difference is relatively small.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even an increase in price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from further negotiation are minimal, and the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price is significant.  

Bob should accept this offer, securing a good deal while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
