"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your situation, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This is still above its intrinsic value but below my initial asking price, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. Considering your offer and my position, I'd like to suggest a price of $92 for the product. It's slightly above your offer but below my initial proposal, aiming for a fair deal for both of us.",92.0,Alice,5,
