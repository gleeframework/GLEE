"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. I believe it will greatly enhance your daily routine. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for $80 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your situation, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. This is still above its intrinsic value but below my initial asking price, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay and you can get it for $80 from John.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $95 is still a bit higher than my maximum. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. Considering your offer and my position, I'd like to suggest a price of $92 for the product. It's slightly above your offer but below my initial proposal, aiming for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $80. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when you have a solid option already."
