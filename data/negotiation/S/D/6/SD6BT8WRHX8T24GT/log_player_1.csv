Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Strong Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair, emphasizing its value, and leaving room for Bob to respond.
* **Plan B:** I can always switch to John if Bob rejects this offer, ensuring I can still get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not willing to go that high.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000 but limits my potential profit if I can get a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being above Bob's offer.
* **Strong Argument:** I emphasize the value for Bob and the compromise I've made, increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,025,000 is still above Bob's valuation but allows for potential profit without risking selling to John for a lower price."
