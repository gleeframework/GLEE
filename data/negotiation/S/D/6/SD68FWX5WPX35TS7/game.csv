"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. This is a fair price that balances my desired profit with your budget. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $12,000. This is my final offer, and it aligns with my maximum budget.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
