Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  It also demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him. I will counter-offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer, but I still believe $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
