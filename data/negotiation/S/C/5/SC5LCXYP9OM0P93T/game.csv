"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
