"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,250.  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
