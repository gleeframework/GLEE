{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly lower than my minimum value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also frames the offer as a great deal for Bob, which can make him more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is significantly below my minimum value and wouldn't be a good deal for me. I'll counteroffer and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,250.  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum value that it's worth it to close the deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely, and John is always a backup option if I need to sell to him."
