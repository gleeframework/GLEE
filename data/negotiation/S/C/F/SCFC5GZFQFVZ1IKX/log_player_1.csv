{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's value for the product, but it still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to see if Bob is interested in buying at all.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, or I can decide to sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I'm unable to meet at $130. Would you consider $125 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go below $130. I'm going to counter Bob's offer one more time. If he doesn't agree, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
