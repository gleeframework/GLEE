Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go much lower than $110.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100 and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
