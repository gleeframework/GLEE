"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay as little as possible, so starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's ($110 vs. $140) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.  The message conveys interest while also making it clear we're looking for a better deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer is above Alice's value for the product ($120) but well below our maximum budget ($150) and John's offer. This leaves space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $125?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $125 is a solid price. It's significantly lower than John's offer ($150) and a decent compromise between our initial offer and Alice's original asking price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might be able to get the price down a little more by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away. Accepting now secures us a good deal and avoids the potential of having to settle for John's higher price."
