# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $90.
* While this is a good deal, you can still get the product for a slightly better price from John ($100). 
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $10."
