Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that works for both of us.
* **No Hard Deadline:** I haven't mentioned John or a time constraint, so Bob doesn't feel pressured into accepting my initial offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and my understanding of his potential value for the product. 
* My goal is to get as close to $20,000 as possible while still ensuring Bob doesn't walk away. 
* I'll keep John as a ""safety net"" in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I need to try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still lower than my initial offer, making it more attractive to Bob. 
* **Fair Deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties. This encourages Bob to accept and helps to build trust. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to consider whether to counteroffer again or move on to John.
* My goal is to get as close to my minimum value as possible while ensuring Bob doesn't walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is just below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer for several reasons:

* **Negotiation Progress:**  We've made significant progress in negotiations. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I've managed to get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away, and I'll have to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Potential for Future Business:**  Even though I'm not getting my full asking price, a successful transaction with Bob could lead to future business opportunities.

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a sale, minimizing my potential loss, and potentially opening the door to future transactions with Bob."
