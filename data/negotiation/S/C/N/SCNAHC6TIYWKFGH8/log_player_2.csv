"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You should reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or if there are any other sellers offering the product for a lower price."
