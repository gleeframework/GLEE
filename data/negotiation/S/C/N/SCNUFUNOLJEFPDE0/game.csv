"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I think you'll love this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $8,000 is still quite low considering the product's value to me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm eager to make this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. It's a bit higher than your limit, but it's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I can go up to $10,000, and I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000, Bob. I think you're getting a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. Let's try $10,500. It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me.",10500.0,Alice,7,
