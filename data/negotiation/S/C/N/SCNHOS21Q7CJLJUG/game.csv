"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $95? That's as high as I'm willing to go.,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I can't go lower than $105.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure I can meet you at $105. How about $98? That's as close as I can get to your original offer.,98.0,Bob,6,
