It's time to cut bait. Bob is clearly comfortable with a slow negotiation to wear you down. At this point, his offer of $9,900 is too close to John's guaranteed $10,000 to risk further haggling.  It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer, and the remaining rounds aren't worth the potential loss."
