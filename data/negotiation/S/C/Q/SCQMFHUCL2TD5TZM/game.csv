"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500 to make this deal work. It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere around $8,000? That would allow me to stay within my financial constraints while still securing a valuable product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
