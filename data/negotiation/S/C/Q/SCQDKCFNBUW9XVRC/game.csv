"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $825,000. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
