Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $95 out of this deal. How about we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her $95 offer.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $80 is the most financially sound decision."
