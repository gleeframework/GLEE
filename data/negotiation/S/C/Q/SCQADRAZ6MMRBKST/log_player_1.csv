Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low, and I'm confident I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is still a great price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still holding out for a higher price, and I think I can get it.  $12,000 is simply too low for me at this point."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob has been very firm on his price, and I don't see any room for negotiation.  I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
