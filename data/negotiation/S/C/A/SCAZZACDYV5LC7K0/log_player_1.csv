I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept as it's the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While I'd love to sell the product for $10,000, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to lower my price a bit to $11,000, which is halfway between our initial offers. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."
