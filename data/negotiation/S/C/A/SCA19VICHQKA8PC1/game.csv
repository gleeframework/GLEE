"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is simply too low for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $65 is too low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $75 is still too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $85.  That's a good price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
