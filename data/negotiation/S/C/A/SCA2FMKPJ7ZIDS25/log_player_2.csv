"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  You stand to save a significant amount by rejecting Alice's offer and going with your backup option."
