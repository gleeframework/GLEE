"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at the moment.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $160?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $170. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
