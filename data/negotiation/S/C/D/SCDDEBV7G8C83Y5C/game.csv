"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. $140 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
