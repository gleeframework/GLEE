"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little too high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about $975,000?  That's a fair compromise between our positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $975,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $990,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about closing the deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I need to be at least at that price to make this worthwhile.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
