"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's a great compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $98? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with it too.",98.0,Alice,5,
