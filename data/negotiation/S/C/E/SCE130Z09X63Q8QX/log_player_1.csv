Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still well above your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation without compromising your goal.
* **It's a clear starting point:** The message provides a concise explanation of the offer, encouraging a response from Bob.

This strategy allows you to potentially secure a higher price while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob chooses to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. It's better to keep negotiating with Bob to potentially get a higher price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but you might be able to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value this product holds for you.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining above your minimum price point. 
* **Highlights the value for Bob:**  Mentioning the value to Bob reinforces the product's worth and justifies the higher price.
* **Proposes a ""meeting in the middle"" approach:** This fosters a collaborative tone and encourages further negotiation.

This counteroffer positions you for a potential agreement while keeping open the possibility of further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than your desired price, and you still have room to negotiate.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially yield a higher price.  There's still a chance that a little more negotiation can bring you closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet in the middle. While I'm not comfortable with $875,000, I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's aim for a final agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrates flexibility:**  This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate further but also sets a clear limit.
* **Highlights value for both sides:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while also reminding him of the product's value. 
* **Emphasizes finality:**  The wording ""aim for a final agreement"" suggests that this is a final offer and encourages Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to secure a price that's closer to your desired price point while also acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  It might be the final offer before you consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to reach a final agreement, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $880,000. I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $880,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still significantly lower than your initial goal and further negotiation might not yield a much higher price.  You've already compromised significantly, and it's likely that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and may not result in a better deal.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees you the desired price and allows you to avoid further negotiation with Bob."
