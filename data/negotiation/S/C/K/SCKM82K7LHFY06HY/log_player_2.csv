# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a more reasonable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $175 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $125.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $160, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in this fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $160 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While I could continue negotiating,  there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  At this point, it's more sensible to go with the guaranteed price from John and avoid further haggling."
