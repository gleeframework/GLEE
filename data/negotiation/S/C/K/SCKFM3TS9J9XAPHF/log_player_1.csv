Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest level. His response will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. Therefore, there's no pressure to accept an offer below that amount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By indicating your willingness to discuss the price, you show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
