"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
