Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her first offer, he can still get a better price.  There's room to negotiate further, and he should try to get closer to his desired price of $1,050,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he would prefer a lower price, $1,120,000 is a good deal for him considering:

* **It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.**  This saves Bob a considerable amount of money.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get him much lower.** Alice has shown she's firm on her price, and pushing for more might risk losing the deal. 

It's a good compromise, and Bob can secure the product while still saving money."
