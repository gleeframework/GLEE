"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value to you is $15,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you is $10,000, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not quite ready to accept $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $15,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you is $10,000, and it's close to my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
