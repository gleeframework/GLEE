"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is only worth $10,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $18,000.  This is a significant markup, and Bob should try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to you is $10,000, and it's closer to my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not quite ready to accept $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $15,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice is offering $15,500, which is still too high for Bob. Since he has a guaranteed alternative with John, it's more beneficial to go with the lower price."
