Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price without explicitly stating it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and ends with an open question, encouraging Bob to engage in discussion and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still being reasonable enough to potentially secure a deal with Bob."
