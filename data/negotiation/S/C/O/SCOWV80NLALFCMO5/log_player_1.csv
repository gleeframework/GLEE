Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'd like to get the best price possible, selling to John for $15,000 is still a better option than accepting $8,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go through more rounds of negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get more than $15,000, it's not worth the risk of losing more time with Bob.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
