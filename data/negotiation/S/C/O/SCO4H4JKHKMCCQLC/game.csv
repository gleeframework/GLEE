"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $950,000? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $920,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is my final offer. If you accept, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",940000.0,Alice,5,
