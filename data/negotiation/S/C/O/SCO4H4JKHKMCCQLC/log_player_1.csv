This offer starts high, but it's still lower than the product's value to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit significantly higher than what John would offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
