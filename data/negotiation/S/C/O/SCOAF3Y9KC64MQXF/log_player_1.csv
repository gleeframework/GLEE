"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth."",
 ""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value ($2,300,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and highlights the product's ""value and potential"" to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Justification:** While high, the opening price is accompanied by a reason (""reflects its true worth""), aiming to make it seem less arbitrary.

This strategy is about maximizing potential gain. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation where you can gradually lower the price while gauging his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a higher price and are willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.  You are still far above your minimum acceptable price, and Bob hasn't given any indication that he's unwilling to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe the product offers significant value beyond your proposed price. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong profit margin. By suggesting a price exactly between your last offer ($2,300,000) and his ($1,750,000), you're demonstrating flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message briefly reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake and why a higher price might be justified.
* **Positive Tone:** The language remains collaborative (""How about we meet in the middle"") to encourage further negotiation and maintain a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's try $1,850,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting both the value of the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's still engaged and sees the value in the product. However, we're still above his perceived value of $1,500,000 and you haven't reached a point where accepting his offer is better than the risk of continuing the negotiation. There's likely room for him to go higher, especially given you're willing to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, your continued interest in the product is great to see.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,925,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value the product will bring to your business, while also recognizing your budget considerations."",
 ""product_price"": 1925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You are making a smaller concession this round ($75,000) compared to Bob's increase ($100,000). This signals that you are reaching the lower end of your acceptable range.
* **Value Justification:** You are continuing to emphasize the product's value to Bob's business, subtly anchoring the price to its benefits rather than just a negotiation number.
* **Positive Tone:**  While being firm on the price, you are maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counter-offer aims to test Bob's willingness to move closer to your price point while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both the value you bring and my budget limitations.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $1,875,000. This is a significant amount above your minimum and a good profit. While you might be able to push for a little more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk Bob will become frustrated or decide the deal isn't worth the additional cost. 

It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing the sale and ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000."
