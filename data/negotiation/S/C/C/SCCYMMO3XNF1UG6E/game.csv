"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal.  Let's find a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still a bit wide for me.  Would you consider $725,000? I'm serious about buying this product and believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground. I'm willing to go to $850,000, but I'm not comfortable going any lower.  This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",850000.0,Alice,5,
