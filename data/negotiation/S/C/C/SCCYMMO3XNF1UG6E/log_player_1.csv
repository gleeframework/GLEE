Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?

The product is worth $1,000,000 to me. Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
