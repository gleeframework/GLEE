"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still too high. I'll try to nudge her closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle on $11,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us."",
