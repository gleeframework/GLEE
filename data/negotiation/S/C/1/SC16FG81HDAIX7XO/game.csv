"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  I think this is a fair price, given its value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a significant step closer to your asking price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",15500.0,Bob,4,
