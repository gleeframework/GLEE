You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $15,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $17,500. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $14,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good value for both of us.

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still more than what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further."
