{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and what it's worth to Bob ($80).  
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and framing the offer as a potential win for Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** I'm trying to get as much money as possible.
* **Negotiation room:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **John's offer:** I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, I can potentially get more.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay $100, giving me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I can use my fallback option with John to push Bob to a more favorable price in the next round.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, hoping to secure a deal closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is closer, I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  How about $95? It's a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the product's quality and value to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic price:** $95 is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price ($100) and potentially profitable. 
* **Strong message:** I reiterate my confidence in the product's value, aiming to convince Bob it's a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $100, but still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Building rapport:**  The positive message aims to maintain a good relationship with Bob, potentially leading to a smoother deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 falls below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's offer is a better deal:**  John is willing to pay $100, which is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a significantly better outcome, and it's more efficient to secure the deal with John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get the maximum possible value for the product.
* **Avoid unnecessary negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and could waste time and energy.
* **Guarantee a sale:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of Bob continuing to counteroffer with lower prices."
