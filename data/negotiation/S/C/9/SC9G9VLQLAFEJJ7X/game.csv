"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"That's a bit out of my budget, I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $12000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If that's still not within your budget, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9500? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11000? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
