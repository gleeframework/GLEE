Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations.  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation higher. This might make Bob perceive a lower price as a better deal later.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept the $120, netting you a significant profit.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
