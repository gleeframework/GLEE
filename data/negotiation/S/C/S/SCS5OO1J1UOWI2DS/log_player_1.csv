"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I'm confident its worth to you is even greater.  I'm prepared to start our negotiation with a price of $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. Selling to John is an option, but I'm hoping to get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I believe $1,050,000 is a fair compromise.  This price allows us both to gain something, and I'm confident the product will exceed your expectations. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $950000 is the sweet spot for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to meet my goals. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $1,000,000 or even higher, leveraging the fact that Bob clearly values the product significantly more.  Selling to John is always a possibility, but I believe I can get a better price through continued negotiation with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price reflects the true value of the product while allowing you to secure a valuable asset. I'm open to discussing a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, Alice, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm concerned that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will lower his price further or become unwilling to negotiate.  

Considering that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, it's a safer and more secure option to sell to him at this point.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal completely."
