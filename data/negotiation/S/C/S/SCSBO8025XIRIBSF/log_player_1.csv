Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down.  I'm confident the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to sell to Bob now than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
