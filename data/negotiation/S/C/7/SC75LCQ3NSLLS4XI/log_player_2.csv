It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer, as I know she's willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  This is a good starting point for negotiations."

Alice is coming down, but still too high. I'll counter again to try and get closer to my desired price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my target.  It's a good strategy to gradually inch towards a compromise."

Alice's offers are getting higher. While I could counteroffer again, it seems she's not budging much, and I'm already risking going over my budget.  At this point, it's safer to buy from John to guarantee the product within my budget."
