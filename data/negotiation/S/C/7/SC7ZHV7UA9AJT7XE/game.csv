,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $115? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $115 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $120. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",120.0,Alice,5,
