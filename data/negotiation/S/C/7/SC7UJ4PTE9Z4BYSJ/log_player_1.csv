Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit above my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while also allowing me to potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. It's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my initial asking price, and it's higher than what John would pay.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
