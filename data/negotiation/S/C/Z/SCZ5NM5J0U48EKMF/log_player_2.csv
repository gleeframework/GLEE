"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if we can get the price closer to John's offer before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has met our alternative price. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John since the cost is the same."
