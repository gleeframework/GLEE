"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $127.50?",127.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about $115? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay under $120.",115.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,128.0
"I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I can see you're trying to stay under $120, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $129?",129.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really trying to stay under $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your last offer. How about $122.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay under $125.",122.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,132.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $122.50 yet. I'm willing to make one more move to try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about $131.50?",131.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. How about $120? I really think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there.",120.0,Bob,8,,
