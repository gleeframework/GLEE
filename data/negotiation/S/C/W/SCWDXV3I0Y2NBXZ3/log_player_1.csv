Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $850,000. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I hope this will incentivize him to accept, as it's still a good deal for him, while allowing me to get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time and John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's the safest option at this point."
