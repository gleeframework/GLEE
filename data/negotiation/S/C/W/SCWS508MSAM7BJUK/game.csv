"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,5,
