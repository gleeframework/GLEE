"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $92? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the price. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still looking for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $88. Can you consider that?",88.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm going to lower my price to $90. This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",90.0,Alice,7,
