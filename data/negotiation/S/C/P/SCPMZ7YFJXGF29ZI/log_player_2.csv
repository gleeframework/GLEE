"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to me than that, but I know you're a serious buyer and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and knows you're interested. Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 valuation."
