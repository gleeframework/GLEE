"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $900,000 but still allows her to make a profit.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might get the price down a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer isn't worth it at this point."
