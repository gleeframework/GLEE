"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
