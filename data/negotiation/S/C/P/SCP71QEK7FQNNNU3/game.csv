"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $120, but I'm willing to meet you at $130. That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $115. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $125. This is getting close to my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can go any lower.",125.0,Alice,7,
