Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $100 for your product. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I would like to get.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
