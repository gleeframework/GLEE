Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'll start with a slightly higher price to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 110}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than the product's value to him, and this offer should give me a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($100), I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 105}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or come close to my minimum price."
