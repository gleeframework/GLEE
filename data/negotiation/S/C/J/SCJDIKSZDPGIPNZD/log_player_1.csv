"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downward while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to gauge his interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I will reject Bob's offer and counter-offer in the next round to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me while showing flexibility to Bob."
