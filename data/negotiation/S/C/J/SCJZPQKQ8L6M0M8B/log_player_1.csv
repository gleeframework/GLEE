Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to pay $950000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm confident that we can reach a final agreement if I could purchase the product for $1000000.
