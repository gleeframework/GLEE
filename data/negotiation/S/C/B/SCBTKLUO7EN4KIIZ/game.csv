"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
