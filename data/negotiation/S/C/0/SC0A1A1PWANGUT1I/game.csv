"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering I'm very interested in purchasing it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you see in the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
