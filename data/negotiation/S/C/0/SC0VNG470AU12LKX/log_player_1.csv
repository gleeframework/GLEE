Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's attractive to Bob (he's getting a $30 discount) but also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $80 if the negotiation falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least sell to John for $80, so I'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $95 isn't my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $80 and a better deal than selling to John.  It seems like Bob is willing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by pushing for a higher price."
