Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fair Offer:**  $1,250,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, showing good faith and potential for agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at my absolute minimum, allowing for a possible counteroffer from Bob. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's worth to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 
 
By offering a price slightly above Bob's value, I aim to  maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's a starting point for further negotiation.  I'm willing to explore counteroffers, but not at a price that severely undervalues my product.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:** I haven't given up on selling to John for my minimum price. If negotiations with Bob break down, I'll have that option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm serious about my desired price and I'm open to continued negotiations, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  While $1,100,000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product, but it also shows my flexibility in reaching a deal.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth, making it clear that $1,150,000 is a fair price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm focusing on finding a solution and making the deal happen.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,150,000 is my new offer, it leaves a small margin for potential adjustments if needed.

My goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.  By striking a balance between my minimum and Bob's offer, I hope to  secure a deal while minimizing the risk of walking away empty-handed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $1,100,000 offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **My Minimum:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.

While I would prefer to close a deal with Bob, his unwillingness to compromise means it's unlikely we'll find a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John ensures I receive my desired value for the product, minimizing risk and maximizing my profit."
