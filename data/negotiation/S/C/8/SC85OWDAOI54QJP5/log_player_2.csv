Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is getting closer, but I need to be closer to $975,000 for this to make sense for me. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.
* Bob is now presented with a choice between accepting a price he can't afford or buying from John, who is offering a price within his budget.
* It is always best to secure the product at the best possible price, especially since it is within his budget and he is certain of the purchase.
* Therefore, the best decision for Bob is to buy the product from John for $800,000."
