"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money.  However, it's not an unreasonable price given the product's value to Alice ($10,000).
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  A $2,000 gap between Bob's offer and Alice's initial price leaves space for further negotiation, allowing for potential compromises.
* **Direct and respectful:** The message is clear and polite, maintaining a positive negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, creating an opportunity to reach a deal quickly.
* **Value proposition:** $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum price point of $15,000.
* **Limited rounds:** With 7 rounds remaining, accepting the offer avoids potentially losing time and a chance to secure the product at a favorable price."
