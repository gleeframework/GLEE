"I appreciate your seriousness about purchasing the product, Bob! I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a commitment. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12500.

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $12500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal happen. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $11500. How about we meet in the middle at $12250? I'm willing to give a bit, but I want to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $12250. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. How about we meet at $11800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, but I need to stay within my budget.",11800.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11800. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
