**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are getting smaller and his final offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that makes continuing the negotiation worthwhile. Accepting John's offer ensures the maximum profit with no further risk or time spent haggling."
