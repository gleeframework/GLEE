"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He should reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
