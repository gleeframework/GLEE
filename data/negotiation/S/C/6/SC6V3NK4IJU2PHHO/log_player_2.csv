"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He starts by offering $10,000, which is a good starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer is a considerable drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's serious intention to negotiate and potentially incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible, and while $10,750 is closer to his target, he can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $10,750 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $10,500?  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money and is willing to meet Alice halfway. By offering $10,500, Bob demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a better price. This offer is closer to Alice's previous offer, signaling a potential point of agreement."
