"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",10200.0,Alice,5,
