"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,200 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his self-imposed limit of $8,000.  At this point, Bob realizes that further negotiation with Alice might not lead to a lower price, and he's better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at $8,000."
