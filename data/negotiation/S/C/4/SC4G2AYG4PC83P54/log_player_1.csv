"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $17,000, which is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my earnings, and this strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His initial response will give me a sense of how seriously he's considering the product.
* **Establish a High Starting Point:** This gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** There's room for me to lower the price if necessary. 
* **Option to Go to John:**  If Bob is unwilling to come close to my price, I have the option to sell to John and get my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and far below what I initially offered. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John immediately would secure $15,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get a higher price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:**  I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'll remind Bob of the product's value and how it can benefit him.
* **Maintain a Firm Stance:**  While I'm open to negotiating, I won't budge too far below my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $9,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,000.  This product really is a great investment for you, and I believe it's worth that amount. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $17,000 to $12,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Offer:** $12,000 is a compromise that still gives me a good profit and is closer to Bob's maximum offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to convince him to meet me halfway.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still finds my price too high. 

**Strategy:**

* **Find Middle Ground:**  By offering $12,000, I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. 
* **Pressure Bob to Accept:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to raise his offer if he wants to continue negotiating.
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I'm still aware of my option to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still a bit too low for me.
* **Further Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob indicated that $10,500 is his absolute maximum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John would secure $15,000, but the potential to get a slightly higher price from Bob is worth the risk of a few more rounds.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Bob's Maximum:** I'll make a counteroffer that's very close to Bob's $10,500, but still slightly higher, to show my willingness to compromise while maximizing my profit.
* **Emphasize Time Constraints:** I'll remind Bob that time is running out and that this may be my final offer.
* **Maintain Firm Stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't budge below my minimum price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  Considering your offer and the fact that we're running out of time, I'm willing to go down to $11,000.  This is my final offer. If you're truly serious about getting this product, I encourage you to accept it. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:**  $11,000 is a significant compromise from my previous offer of $12,000 and is very close to Bob's maximum.
* **Emphasis on Time:** Reminding Bob that time is running out adds pressure and increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message still reminds Bob of the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

* **Close the Deal:**  I aim to close the deal by offering a price that's attractive to Bob while still achieving a good profit for me.
* **Minimize Risk:**  The $11,000 offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal, as it's close to Bob's maximum.
* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could accept John's offer of $15,000, I'm trying to maximize my profit by getting closer to my initial asking price."
