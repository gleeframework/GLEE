Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what I can get from John.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $100."
