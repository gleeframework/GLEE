"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is still fair for you, considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his budget.
* Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since Alice has stated this is her ""final offer"". 
* Buying from John for $1,200,000 would save Bob money, but the value of the product might not be worth the risk of losing out on the potentially better product from Alice.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most strategic move.  Bob gets a decent deal while also ensuring he secures the product."
