"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price is still fair for you, considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
