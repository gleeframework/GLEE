"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. This product would be a great fit for me, but I'm only willing to go as high as $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer you $12,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I'm hoping we can make a deal, but I need you to meet me halfway.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I need to get a bit closer. How about we meet at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,7,
