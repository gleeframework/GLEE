"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your research and understanding of similar products. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $8000, as the product's value to me is at least $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on the item, I am still unable to meet you at $11000. Based on my assessment, I believe $9500 would be a reasonable price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to negotiate a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9500, as it's still below my minimum value of $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll find it acceptable.",10800.0,Alice,5,
