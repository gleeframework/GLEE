Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to get for this product.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is a fantastic deal and I think you'll be very happy with it.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer for $12,000."
