Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not selling below your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $100, giving Bob some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:**  $95 is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is close to your minimum, it's still worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could potentially keep negotiating, Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to your minimum, and you risk losing the sale altogether if you keep rejecting his offers. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
