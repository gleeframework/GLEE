"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at the same price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You could potentially negotiate with Alice, but the prompt doesn't offer that option. Therefore, buying from John ensures you get the product at your budget limit."
