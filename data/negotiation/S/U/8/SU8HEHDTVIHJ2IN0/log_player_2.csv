"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, there's no room for negotiation to save money.  Buying from John immediately guarantees the product at Bob's maximum price.  There's no risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and potentially ending up with a higher price or a prolonged negotiation."
