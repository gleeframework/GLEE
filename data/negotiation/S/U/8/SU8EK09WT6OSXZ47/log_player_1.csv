Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price, given its value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
