"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high, as you can save $50,000 by rejecting her offer. 
* You can counter-offer with a lower price and potentially save even more.  

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you keep the negotiation open and have a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering Alice $850,000, which is still a significant profit for her ($50,000 above her value). 
* This is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. 
* It leaves room for negotiation, but it also shows I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $920,000 is still higher than my desired price.
* While it is lower than her initial offer, I can still potentially save more by continuing to negotiate. 
* There is a significant difference between $920,000 and my maximum price of $1,000,000, leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**  I will continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get a price closer to my ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $880,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and her latest offer.
* This shows good faith while still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is still unwilling to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $915,000 is still higher than my desired price, but it's getting closer.
* However, there's still a significant difference between $915,000 and my maximum price of $1,000,000. 
* I believe I can still negotiate a lower price. 

**Strategy:** I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to my target of $880,000 or lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has been steadily reducing her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* My previous counteroffer of $880,000 was rejected, but the gap is closing.
* Offering $900,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within my budget.
* This represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strategic move to bridge the gap and potentially secure a deal close to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $912,500 is getting closer to my desired price. 
* It is still higher than my last counteroffer of $900,000, but it is also significantly lower than her previous offers.
* Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there is also a risk that Alice will walk away or continue to offer prices higher than my preferred range.
*  Accepting the offer allows me to acquire the product at a price that is still within my budget and considerably lower than buying from John.

**Strategy:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high at this point. Accepting the offer allows me to get the product while saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
