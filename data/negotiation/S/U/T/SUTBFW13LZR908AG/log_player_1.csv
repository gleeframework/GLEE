Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, implying that my offer is still a good deal for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is not a ""take it or leave it"" proposition. I'm open to discussing it further.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your value.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value, even though it is below Bob's value. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. I'll try to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price halfway between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to emphasize that my counteroffer is still beneficial for him.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm also setting a firm lower limit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price above my minimum value.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll have to decide whether to accept his next offer or move on to John."
