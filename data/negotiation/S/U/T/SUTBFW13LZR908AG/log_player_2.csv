"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can still get a better price than $1,150,000.  While it's tempting to accept, it's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your value.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1050000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer. It's still within your budget and closer to your ideal price than buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject your next offer and you'd be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  It's wise to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
