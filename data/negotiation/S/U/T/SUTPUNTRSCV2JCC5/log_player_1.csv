"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, as he values the product at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a little low, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price.  I'm hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his value for the product, and it's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I've already had two rounds of negotiation and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go higher.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
