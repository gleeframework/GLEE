"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you. My initial offer is $1300000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your desired price range. While it's a better price than John's offer, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can secure a deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1100000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1200000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is now within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option."
