Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for you. My initial offer is $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,300,000, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob emphasizes the potential benefit for him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a good starting point. If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but always keeping in mind John's offer of $1,000,000 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $1,100,000 is more than John's offer, it doesn't meet my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll use this opportunity to test how far Bob is willing to go and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you acknowledging the value of this product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,200,000? This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer to Bob, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that $1,200,000 represents a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and constructive tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Call to Action:**  I encourage Bob to consider my offer and attempt to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer is a step closer to Bob's initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I'm aiming for a price that is both acceptable to me and potentially enticing enough for Bob to consider. The next step will depend on Bob's response."
