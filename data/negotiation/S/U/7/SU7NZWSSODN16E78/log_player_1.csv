"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and it gives you a good profit margin. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
