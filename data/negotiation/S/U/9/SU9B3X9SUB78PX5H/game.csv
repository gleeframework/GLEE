"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1600000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1450000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1450000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1525000? This would still allow you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product. What do you say?",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1525000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to sell quickly and me to acquire the product within my price range. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
