"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think you'll find this to be a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  There's still room to negotiate a lower price, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
