"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $95, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm also trying to keep the negotiation positive by suggesting a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again in the next round. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try $97.50. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

I'm counter-offering with $97.50. This is a small step closer to Bob's offer, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable amount.  I'm emphasizing the idea of a compromise to keep the negotiation moving forward."
