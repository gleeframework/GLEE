"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do like the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay you $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't enough for me.  Let's try $97.50. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",97.5,Alice,5,
