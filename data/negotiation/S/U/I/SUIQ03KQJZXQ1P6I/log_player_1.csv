"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is still a healthy profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. I'm trying to find a compromise point while still maintaining a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
