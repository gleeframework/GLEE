"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000.  This is a very competitive offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
