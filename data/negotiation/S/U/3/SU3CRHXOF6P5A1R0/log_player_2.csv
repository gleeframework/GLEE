"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it would be worth at least $1,200,000 to you,  based on the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  This price allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
