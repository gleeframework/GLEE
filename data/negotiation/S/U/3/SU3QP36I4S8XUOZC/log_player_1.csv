"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to stay within my desired price range."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $890,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It also gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation and Bob's threat to walk away is real.  $880,000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
