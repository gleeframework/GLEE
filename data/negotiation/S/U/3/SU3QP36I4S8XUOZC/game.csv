,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to stay within my desired price range.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $890,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. It also gets us closer to a deal, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal quickly.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Bob,6,
