# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product while saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
