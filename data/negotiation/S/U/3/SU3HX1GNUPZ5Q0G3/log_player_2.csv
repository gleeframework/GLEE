Alice's offer:

We've reached a point where the price differences are getting very small.  Alice seems to be holding firm around $11,000. It's unlikely further haggling will get us a significantly better deal. Taking the $11,250 offer ensures I get the product and still saves me a decent amount compared to John's offer."
