"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome. This also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's important to remember I have the option of selling to John at any point for $1,000,000, so I can be fairly aggressive in this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm aiming to find a middle ground while still getting a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but still below my minimum. I'm not ready to sell for $900,000 yet. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, as I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm  lowering my price again, but only by $100,000. I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I still want a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price. I'm willing to accept this offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to secure a deal than continue negotiating and risk losing out on this sale."
