"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($12,000).** 
* **It's a significant improvement from her initial offer ($10,000).** 
* **The risk of further negotiation could lead to a higher price or a stalemate, making buying from John a more likely outcome.**

Accepting Alice's offer at $9,500 is the best strategy to secure the product while saving money."
