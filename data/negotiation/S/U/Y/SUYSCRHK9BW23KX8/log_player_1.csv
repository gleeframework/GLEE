Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but not too high that it seems unreasonable. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard price, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer. This makes the negotiation more engaging and less likely to end abruptly. 
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum value of $100.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale above my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While it's tempting to take the quick $85, I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm willing to risk a bit more to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or perhaps even a bit higher if I believe he's willing to go up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is willing to budge further.  If he rejects this, I'll need to decide whether to accept his previous offer or sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a deal that is within my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is just $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I'd ideally prefer to get closer to $100, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Bob walking away completely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a significantly better offer.

**Next Steps:**

* By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale that is close to my desired price and minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
