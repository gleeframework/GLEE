"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's sure to be appealing.  Let's discuss a price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum price of $12,000, there's a chance you could get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or confirm if John would stick to his $12,000 price."
