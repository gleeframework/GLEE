"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than mine. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're looking to save as much money as possible and $1,100,000 is still quite a bit more than the product's value to you ($1,200,000).
* **There are still 9 rounds left.**  This gives you plenty of time to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you can always buy from John, although that will cost you the maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still above her value for the product. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further concessions if necessary.
* **Clear communication:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer and leaves the door open for discussion. 
* **Strategic pricing:** This price point gives you a buffer, allowing you to potentially lower the price further in subsequent rounds while still maintaining a margin that's acceptable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to me is quite high.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000 as a compromise. This reflects the significant potential I see it bringing to your business. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above your target price and leaves you less negotiating room. 
* **More rounds to negotiate:** There are 7 rounds remaining, giving you time to potentially reach a lower price. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net:** If you can't reach an agreeable price with Alice, you can still buy from John, although at a higher cost.

**Next Move:**  You should send a counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your target of $950,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which represents a significant investment on my end.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,012,500.  This is a fair offer considering the product's potential value.  It's a small movement, but I'm confident this will be a win-win.
