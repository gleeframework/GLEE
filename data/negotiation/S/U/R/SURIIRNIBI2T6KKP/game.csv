"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $14,000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
