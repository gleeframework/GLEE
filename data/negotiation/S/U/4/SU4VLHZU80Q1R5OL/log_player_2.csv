"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it will be a great asset to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the product well below Alice's asking price. Starting with a significantly lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room:** Even with this lower offer, we're still a comfortable distance from our maximum budget of $1,500,000 and John's alternative price.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is a good sign, but we're still aiming lower. We're in a strong position, with John's offer as a backup. Continuing the negotiation gives us a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and her current offer, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target price. 
* **Pressure Point:**  Alice has indicated a willingness to negotiate.  This offer puts a bit of pressure on her, as it's closer to her perceived value of the product.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're now four rounds in.  A slightly more assertive approach may help speed up the process while we still have room to maneuver."
