"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value. I'm confident in the product's worth, and this gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'll be ready to adjust if he counters, but I'm hoping to close the deal in the first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price. I'll counteroffer, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is significantly below what I need to sell.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is too low for you. How about we meet closer to the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Considering we've only got 6 rounds left, I think it's best to accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations. It's better to get a decent deal than to risk losing the deal entirely."
