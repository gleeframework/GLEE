Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it, reflecting its true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $98?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 98}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the product's value to me, I would like to offer $96 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my ideal price, it's close enough and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob.  It's better than selling to John for $100, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might not lead to a better result."
