"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still above your ideal price point. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $90 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
