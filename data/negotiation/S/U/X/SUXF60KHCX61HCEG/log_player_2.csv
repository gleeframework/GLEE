"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling price. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $800,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a reasonable compromise.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's aim for a win-win scenario. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Here's why:

* **Time is running out:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left.  
* **Alice's price is still too high:** While $1,050,000 is a lower offer from Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a successful outcome. 

It's more strategic for Bob to secure the product now at a known price than to risk losing the opportunity to a lower offer from Alice."
