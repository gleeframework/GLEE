"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",14000.0,Bob,4,
