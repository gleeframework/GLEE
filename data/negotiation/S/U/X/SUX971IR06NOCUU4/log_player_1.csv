This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to counter or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$750,000 is far too low for me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a reasonable profit, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum than before, it's still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'll make another counteroffer."

This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $795,000. I believe this is the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems we're not going to reach an agreement.  His final offer of $795,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To avoid further delays and ensure a profitable sale, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
