"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product to me is quite significant, and $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $14,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
