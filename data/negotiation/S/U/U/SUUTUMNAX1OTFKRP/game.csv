"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a fair price considering I'm making a significant commitment to purchase this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
