"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  However,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers, at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, we're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. The negotiation progress is too slow to justify continuing with Bob, especially since we have a guaranteed offer of $12,000 from John."
