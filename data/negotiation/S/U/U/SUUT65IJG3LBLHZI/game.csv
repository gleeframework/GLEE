"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  However,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers, at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
