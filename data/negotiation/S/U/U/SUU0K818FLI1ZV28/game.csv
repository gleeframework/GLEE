"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it still represents a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making a concession, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we compromise at $1,025,000? This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
