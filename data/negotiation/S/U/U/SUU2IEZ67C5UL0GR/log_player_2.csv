While $105 is very close to your budget, you're still $5 over your ideal price.  There are still a few rounds left, and you should keep pushing for your target price of $100. You can also consider the risk of losing this opportunity to Alice if you keep rejecting her offers. However, you should still negotiate for the best possible price."
