"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another option.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
