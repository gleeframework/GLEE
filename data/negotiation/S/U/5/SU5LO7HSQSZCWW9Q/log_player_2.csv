# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product to you. It is an exceptional opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs and expectations. We believe its value far exceeds $1,200,000, but considering the current market conditions and your potential benefit, we are offering it to you at this exclusive price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I encourage you to consider this proposal carefully. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is only worth $1,200,000 to him, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup, and Bob should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and believe it has significant potential, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is the maximum I'm able to spend, and I hope it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
