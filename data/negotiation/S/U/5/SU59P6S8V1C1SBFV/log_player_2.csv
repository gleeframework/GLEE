"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on your needs and interests. Given its high value to you, I'm offering it at a special introductory price of $10500. This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $12000, while still allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of its worth. I understand that this might be a considerable investment, but I assure you, the benefits will far outweigh the cost. If you're interested in discussing further details or have any questions, please let me know. I'm looking forward to potentially bringing this product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $10,500, while John is selling for $12,000.  
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer and save $1,500."
