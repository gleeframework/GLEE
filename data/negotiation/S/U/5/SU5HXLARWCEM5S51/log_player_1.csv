Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us -  you'll be getting a valuable product for less than you'd be willing to pay, and I'll get a significant return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, emphasizing the value Bob would get.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer gives Bob enough wiggle room to make a counteroffer, which would allow me to potentially increase the price further.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable paying $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's a ""good deal"" for him, it doesn't come close to what the product is worth to me. 
* **I have a better backup option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much more financially advantageous outcome.
* **Negotiation room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I have the leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving the needle:** My counteroffer is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but still below my minimum and well within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value Bob would get, framing the price as fair and reasonable considering the product's worth.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept, suggesting a ""let's close this deal"" attitude.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not willing to drop below my minimum, but I'm also not walking away yet. This counteroffer allows further negotiation, keeping the door open for a deal without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product for you. Let's settle on this and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **No significant movement:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's not a significant enough jump to warrant accepting.
* **John's offer is far superior:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much more profitable option, so there's no pressure to accept Bob's offer.
* **More negotiation room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $950,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer than my previous one, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Compromise, but not too much:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum and within a reasonable range considering the product's value.
* **Maintaining urgency:** I'm again emphasizing a desire to close the deal, hoping to nudge Bob towards acceptance. 
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have room to lower the price slightly without dropping below my minimum. 

By offering $1,100,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of a successful sale."
