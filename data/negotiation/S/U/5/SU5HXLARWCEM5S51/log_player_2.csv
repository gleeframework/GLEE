"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us -  you'll be getting a valuable product for less than you'd be willing to pay, and I'll get a significant return.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a much lower price from John, and there's no reason to pay more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a significant amount more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll receive. Let's close this deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,200,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product from John for $800,000, so there's no reason to pay more.  Bob should counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $950,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll receive and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's make this happen.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is unwilling to come down to a price that's within Bob's budget, and the negotiations have stalled. It's now in Bob's best interest to buy the product from John for $800,000."
