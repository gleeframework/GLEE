"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $150 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $80. It's better to counteroffer or explore buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $130. How about we meet at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his maximum of $80. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $135 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's closer to what I can afford and still leaves you with a profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $135, which would be $122.50. I'm willing to accept that price, but I need to make a minimum of $122.50 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $122.50 is still over Bob's budget of $80.  It's time for Bob to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $80.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and has made several counteroffers, but it seems Alice is not willing to come down to a price he can afford.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk further negotiation that may not be successful."
