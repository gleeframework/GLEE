Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum of $120 if I sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $100.  This is a compromise between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $95. This is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiations and ensure a sale."
