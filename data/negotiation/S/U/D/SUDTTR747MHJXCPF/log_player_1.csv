Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to make at least $80, so $120 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message conveys that you're willing to discuss the price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired minimum of $80. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still aiming for a profit.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you in the middle!"
