"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $100 but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  You want to make sure your counteroffer is attractive enough for Alice to consider while still aiming for a price that's closer to your target."
