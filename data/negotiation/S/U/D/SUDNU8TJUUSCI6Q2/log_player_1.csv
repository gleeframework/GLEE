"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at ($10,000), but still lower than my minimum ($12,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This allows for room to negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer, but still ensures I make a profit.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have 10 rounds, so I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good price"" aspect for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining profit:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so I'll still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. Would you consider $10,000 as a fair offer for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now my minimum:**  $10,000 is the minimum price I was willing to accept for the product.
* **No more negotiation room:** Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, and I risk losing the deal.
* **Time constraint:** We are already in round 4, and I want to secure a sale before the 10 rounds are up.

While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
