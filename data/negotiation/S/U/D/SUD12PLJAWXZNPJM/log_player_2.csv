{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice's offer is $170, significantly exceeding your limit.
* **Negotiation is necessary:** Rejecting the offer allows you to enter a negotiation and attempt to get a better price. 
* **John is an option:** Knowing John is willing to sell for $120 provides a safety net if negotiations fail."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening strong:** Starting with your maximum price sets the negotiation at your desired level. 
* **No room for compromise:** You've already established your upper limit, making it clear that you're not willing to pay more.
* **Pressuring Alice:** This counteroffer forces Alice to either accept a lower price or potentially lose the sale."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** This offer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway again, demonstrating your commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Testing for acceptance:**  This price point is close to your limit, and it could be tempting for Alice to accept to avoid potentially losing the sale altogether. 
* **One step away from John:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you're only one counteroffer away from buying from John, which puts pressure on Alice."
