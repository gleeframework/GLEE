"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, but still lower than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob room to negotiate and increases the chances of a deal.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible in the first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to make a final attempt to get a price close to my minimum acceptable price. This price is a significant compromise and leaves minimal room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John and secure my minimum value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed price of $150."
