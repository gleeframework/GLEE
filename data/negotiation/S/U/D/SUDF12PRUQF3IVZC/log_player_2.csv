Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've already made one more counteroffer than I planned, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly, and I think it's worth at least $20. So, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get.
