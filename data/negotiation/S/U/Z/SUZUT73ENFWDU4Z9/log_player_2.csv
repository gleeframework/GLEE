"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample time to negotiate and try to secure a better price.  
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, even if it means a few more rounds."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive first counteroffer:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price shows your intent to negotiate aggressively. 
* **Consider Alice's value:**  While this offer is lower than the product's worth to you, it's still significantly higher than what it's worth to Alice, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a back-and-forth where you can gradually increase your offer while Alice likely decreases hers."
