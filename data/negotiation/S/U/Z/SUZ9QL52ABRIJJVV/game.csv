"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet at $16,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so how about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,500 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but $15,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's not waste more time, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're willing to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer of $13,500, so how about $14,250?",14250.0,Bob,6,
