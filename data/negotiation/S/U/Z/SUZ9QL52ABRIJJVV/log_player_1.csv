"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down and still potentially earn a decent profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm stating that I'm open to discussing a fair price to show that I'm willing to work with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not immediately giving away my minimum acceptable price, as I want to see if Bob is willing to come up in his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not immediately accepting it.  I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open. This allows me to potentially receive a counteroffer closer to my desired price in the next round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to take a small risk and see if I can earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet at $16,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise. Meeting at $16,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to help justify the price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above the minimum price I'm willing to accept, leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000, so how about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to accept.  I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm still relatively early in the process.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob for now to see if I can secure a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. If I were to accept, I might be signaling that I'm willing to settle for less than I could potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $13,500 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but $15,000 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's not waste more time, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making my position clear by stating a firm bottom line, but also making it clear that I believe this price is still fair to both of us.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly implying that time is running out, which might push Bob to consider my offer more seriously.
* **Avoiding Further Back and Forth:** I'm trying to avoid endless rounds of counteroffers by putting a clear limit on my willingness to negotiate. This might lead Bob to consider my offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my previous offer of $13,500, so how about $14,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It appears we've reached an impasse, with Bob unwilling to go any higher and me unwilling to drop below $15,000.
* **Risk of Losing Value:**  While $14,250 is not a terrible price, I'm not confident that Bob will budge further.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, allowing me to secure a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation. I've already spent several rounds trying to reach an agreement with Bob, and it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't come to a mutually agreeable price.  This decision is about minimizing risk and maximizing profit."
