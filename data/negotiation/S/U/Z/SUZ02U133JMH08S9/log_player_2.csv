"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and try to get a better price. It's also significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth to me, which suggests there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the potential benefits I see, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being reasonable for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $800,000, and it's within my budget.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to sell.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
