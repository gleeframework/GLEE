Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the potential benefits I see, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
