"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe can be incredibly valuable to your business. While I understand the market value of this product is around $800,000, I'm willing to make a special deal for you at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering the potential it holds. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is ready to pay full price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
