Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very firm on her price and inching closer to John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely she'll drop to a price significantly better than John's in the remaining rounds.  Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you a reasonable deal without further negotiation risk."
