"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there are still 10 rounds to negotiate. Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering."

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. While Alice's offer is better than the initial price, Bob still has room to negotiate and can likely get closer to his target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $1,075,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" and the price is getting closer to Bob's target.  It's likely that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice will hold firm and the price won't go lower. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not getting the product at all is increasing, and buying from John would be a worse financial outcome."
