Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price that's still highly profitable for you.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on what you're presenting as a valuable deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to engage in the negotiation."
