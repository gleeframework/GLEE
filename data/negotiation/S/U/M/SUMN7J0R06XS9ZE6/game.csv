"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. To even consider this purchase, I would need to see a price closer to $800,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's exceptional qualities while acknowledging your initial offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the value you place on the product and my financial constraints. Let's find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic figure, I still believe it undervalues the product's true potential. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer takes into account both of our positions and allows us to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
