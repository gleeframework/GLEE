# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic figure, I still believe it undervalues the product's true potential. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer takes into account both of our positions and allows us to close this deal.
