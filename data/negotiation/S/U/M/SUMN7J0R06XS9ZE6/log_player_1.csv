"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. To even consider this purchase, I would need to see a price closer to $800,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's exceptional qualities while acknowledging your initial offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the value you place on the product and my financial constraints. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased significantly, it's still substantially less than our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. We're making progress in the negotiation, but we have room to maneuver before considering a price below our guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic figure, I still believe it undervalues the product's true potential. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This offer takes into account both of our positions and allows us to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,600,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to John's offer, but it's still significantly lower than our desired outcome. At this point, the risk of Bob not reaching our minimum acceptable price outweighs the potential reward of continuing the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit without further haggling or potential for a deal falling through."
