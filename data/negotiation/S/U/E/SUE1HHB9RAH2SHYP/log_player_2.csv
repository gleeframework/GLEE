"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this offer interests you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counteroffering. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to try to meet somewhere in the middle. I am proposing a price of $9,250 for the product. This is my best offer based on the value I place on it. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $9,250, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He is only $500 away from his target price of $8,500, and there are 7 rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,250 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  If you're serious about making a deal, I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After considering our previous discussions, I am willing to lower the price to $9,500. This is the most I can reasonably reduce the price while still ensuring a fair return for myself. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, but it's still above Bob's target price of $8,500.  With only 5 rounds left, the likelihood of getting a better deal from Alice is slim.  It's time to cut his losses and take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price point."
