"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. To make this deal work, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This would allow us both to achieve a favorable outcome.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $875,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference and go with $862,500. This would be a significant saving for me and still allow you to get a good price for your product.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $862,500. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a price of $880,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm grateful for your continued willingness to negotiate. While $880,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price that aligns better with my budget.  I'm offering $850,000 for the product. This price would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to sell the product quickly while I get the best possible value. Let's close this deal on this price, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",850000.0,Bob,6,
