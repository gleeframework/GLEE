Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $7000. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $8,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. 

While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, it's taking too many rounds and we're still not at a price I'm completely comfortable with. John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that while continuing to negotiate with Bob."
