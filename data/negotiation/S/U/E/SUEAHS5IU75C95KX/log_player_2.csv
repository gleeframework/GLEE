"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still more than what the product is worth to you ($120). You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, a price of $90 is still a good profit for her.  This counteroffer gives her a reasonable margin while also getting you a lower price than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $95 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price point.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing time is greater than the potential benefit of a few dollars saved.  Accepting this offer is the most reasonable and practical choice."
