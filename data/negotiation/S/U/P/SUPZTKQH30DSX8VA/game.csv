"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair offer.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. That's my final offer.",10750.0,Alice,7,
