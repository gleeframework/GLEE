"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's room for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price lower than $1,350,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While your offer is appreciated, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's inherent worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still able to negotiate a better price. Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($1,000,000), leaving room for further compromise.  There's still a chance to secure a price closer to his ideal range, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive."
