"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's valuation ($10,000) to maximize his savings. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but not so low that it's insulting.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob has left some wiggle room for further negotiation in case Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise,  it's a bit above Bob's initial counteroffer but significantly less than Alice's original asking price.
* **Value for Money:** Bob is getting the product for a price that is within his budget and offers good value.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** While there's a chance Bob could get an even lower price by rejecting and counteroffering again, there's also a risk that Alice might get frustrated and call off the negotiation.  $11,000 is a reasonable price, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
