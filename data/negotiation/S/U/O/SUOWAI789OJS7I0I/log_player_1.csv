{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see immense value in.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair for both of us.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves a $200,000 potential profit margin to negotiate within.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of that margin while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($75,000 less than his valuation). This price point encourages Bob to accept, as it's a win-win situation. 

**Important Note:** This initial offer is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters, but don't go below your $800,000 minimum."
