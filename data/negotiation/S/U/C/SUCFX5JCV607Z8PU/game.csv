"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still be a great deal for you as it's well below the product's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
