"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still too high for the value you place on the product. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still be a great deal for you as it's well below the product's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating towards a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
